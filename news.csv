0,Michigan warns about mosquito-borne virus after 3 deaths,"Public health officials are urging people to guard against mosquito bites after more cases of a rare mosquito-borne virus, including two additional deaths in southwestern Michigan.  The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services issued an update Tuesday on Eastern equine encephalitis, saying there were deaths in Cass and Van Buren counties. Those follow an earlier death in Kalamazoo County.    There also have been human cases in Barry and Berrien counties, and animal cases in St. Joseph, Genesee and Lapeer counties. In all, Michigan has had seven confirmed human cases and nine horse deaths.  The department is encouraging officials in affected counties to consider postponing, rescheduling or cancelling outdoor activities occurring at or after dusk, particularly activities that involve children, until there's a hard frost.   The virus is rare but dangerous, and symptoms include fever, chills and muscle and joint pain. It can cause inflammation and swelling in the brain.   According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 30 per cent of people infected with the virus die.   At least 20 cases have been reported in five states.",health
1,"Liberals pledge to boost Canada Child Benefit, extend leave for adoptive parents","The Liberals are promising a suite of family-friendly benefits, including a boost to the Canada Child Benefit (CCB) for babies and a 15-week leave program for adoptive parents.  Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau used a Tuesday morning campaign appearance in St. John's to announce the proposed measures, which include making parental benefits tax-free.  Calling it a ""big step forward,"" Trudeau pledged that a re-elected Liberal government would give families up to $1,000 more by increasing the CCB by 15 per cent for children under the age of one. The CCB was introduced in 2016 and the Liberals have credited it with lifting 300,000 children out of poverty.  ""No one should have to choose between their paycheque and their family, a choice that moms are still confronted with more than dads,"" Trudeau said. ""People should be focused on spending time with their baby, not worried about how they'll pay their bills.""    The Liberal proposal to make maternity and parental benefits tax-exempt at source means no federal taxes would be taken off the Employment Insurance payment, Trudeau said. It goes one step further than the Conservative Party proposal to bring in a non-refundable tax credit for maternity or parental benefits.   ""You'll get every dollar right when you need it, since no taxes will be taken off the EI cheque when new parents receive it,"" Trudeau said.    The proposed new 15-week leave for adoptive parents would give them the same benefits as those who have a baby through natural birth. That would mean an extra $7,000 in help for the average family claiming the new adoptive leave, according to the Liberal Party documents.  Trudeau said these measures lay the groundwork to ""go even further.""  A re-elected Liberal government also would work with the provinces and territories to establish Guaranteed Paid Family Leave for parents who don't qualify for paid leave through EI during the first year of their child's life. The party's proposal calls for the program to launch in 2021.  'Ambitious program'  ""This will be an ambitious program to make sure that no one gets left behind,"" Trudeau said.  Lindsay Tedds, an economics professor at the University of Calgary, said she's awaiting finer details on how the tax measures would be implemented in order to fully assess both proposals. She said one advantage of the Liberal plan over the Conservative one is that claimants won't have to worry about the tax liability.  ""A lot of women who work earn a lot of income before they go on maternity benefits, and they actually pay a higher tax rate on that income than 15 per cent,"" she said. ""So the Conservatives haven't accounted for that, whereas the Liberals are accounting for that ... The Liberals can actually tout this as tax-free maternity and parental benefits. The Conservatives can't.""  According to Liberal Party calculations, the proposed measures would cost about $800 million in 2020-21, rising to $1.2 billion in 2023-24. Costing analysis from the parliamentary budget officer (PBO) has not yet been released.  Asked why none of the Liberal campaign commitments so far have come with PBO costing, Trudeau said the PBO has been ""very much engaged"" with the Liberal Party on its platform.  ""We will have a full costing of the Liberal platform with all the great work done by the PBO in due course. That is something people expect and people want to have,"" he said.",business
2,Hundreds join student's climate-change pledge: No kids until Canada takes action,"An 18-year-old McGill University student pledges to not have children until she is sure the Canadian government is taking serious steps to battle climate change.  And hundreds more are following in her footsteps.  ""Our government isn't doing enough,"" Emma Lim said on CBC Montreal's Daybreak Tuesday.  The steps provincial and federal lawmakers are taking are ""nowhere near the action needed,"" she said.  The young climate activist decided to take action of her own — launching a climate-change movement dubbed, ""#No Future, No Children,"" that is quickly gathering steam.   Her campaign, which invites all Canadians to participate, officially kicked off Monday on Parliament Hill.   As of Tuesday morning, more than 300 people have signed her online pledge, which states: ""I pledge to not have children until I am sure my government will ensure a safe future for them.""  Having kids is something Lim has always thought was in her future, but she wants a future where, every fall, she can watch the leaves change colour.  She wants to go sledding with her kids in the winter and swimming in the ocean in the summer.  ""I am giving up my chance of having a family because I will only have children if I know I can keep them safe,"" she writes on her website.   ""It breaks my heart, but I created this pledge because I know I am not alone.""    She wants her children to breathe clean air and live a life in economic security — not the possible insecurity wrought by climate change, she said.  Lim said she comes from a family of Holocaust survivors who have experienced first-hand the impact mass migration can have on people's lives.  Mass migration caused by a global climate crisis could be many times what her family experienced and just the idea that her children may have to ""again face the very worst of humanity terrifies me,"" she said.    Dreams of motherhood  Lim grew up in London, Ont., and she has wanted to be a mom for as long as she can remember. She still has a list of baby names on her computer, she said.  Listen to Emma Lim's interview on Daybreak here:   Giving up that dream is not easy, she said, and she worries that, despite her best efforts, nothing will change.  The patriotism she felt as a child — the belief that her government can do anything — is fading, she said.  ""It's clear that our leaders aren't taking this seriously and this is a serious issue,"" she said, citing the federal government's approval of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion on the heels of proclaiming a climate crisis.    As it is, Canada is not on track to meeting the Paris Agreement goals, she said. Were the country to take the necessary steps to meet those goals, she said she may one day consider having kids, but everyone who pledges has a different objective.  Her aim is to look to the future with hope instead of fear, she said.    Waiting until the government takes action before having kids is an ""alien concept"" for her parents and grandparents, Lim said, but she's getting support back home.  Mother supports daughter  Lim's mother, Catherine Cartman, went to Ottawa to support her daughter.  ""It's a parent's role to support their children,"" she said, and she hopes it will inspire change.     Cartman, a mother of three, said she wants Lim and ""youth everywhere to feel safe to have children.""  While she would like Lim to have children someday, she said, were the world to fall into complete disarray because of a climate crisis, ""who can blame her for not having children? ""  ""It would be selfish on my part to encourage her to have children under those circumstances.""",technology
3,"Purdue Pharma, maker of OxyContin, files for bankruptcy as part of settlement ","Purdue Pharma, the company that made billions selling the prescription painkiller OxyContin, filed for bankruptcy in White Plains, N.Y., days after reaching a tentative settlement with many of the state and local governments suing it over the toll of opioids.  The filing was anticipated before and after the tentative deal, which could be worth up to $12 billion US over time, was struck.  ""This settlement framework avoids wasting hundreds of millions of dollars and years on protracted litigation,"" Steve Miller, chairman of Purdue's board of directors, said in a statement, ""and instead will provide billions of dollars and critical resources to communities across the country trying to cope with the opioid crisis. We will continue to work with state attorneys general and other plaintiff representatives to finalize and implement this agreement as quickly as possible.""  But legal battles still lie ahead for Stamford, Conn.-based Purdue, which is spending millions on legal costs as it defends itself in lawsuits from 2,600 government and other entities. About half the states have not signed onto the proposal. And several of them plan to object to the settlement in bankruptcy court and to continue litigation in other courts against members of the Sackler family, which owns the company. The family agreed to pay at least $3 billion in the settlement plus contribute the company itself, which is to be reformed with its future profits going to the company's creditors.  In a statement, the families of late company owners Mortimer and Raymond Sackler said they have ""deep compassion for the victims of the opioid crisis"" and believe the settlement framework ""is an historic step toward providing critical resources that address a tragic public health situation.""    Objections came over the amount of the deal, which some officials say will not reach close to the $12 billion mark, and because it means the company won't be found liable by a jury or judge.  Purdue chairman Miller said the company has not admitted wrongdoing and does not intend to. ""The alternative is to not settle but instead to resume the litigation,"" he said on a conference call with reporters. ""The resumption of litigation would rapidly diminish all the resources of the company and would be lose-lose-lose all the way around. Whatever people might wish for is not on the table now.""  Because so many states balked at the settlement, it could complicate the bankruptcy process. The Sackler family members said they're still trying to get more states to sign on.  ""We are hopeful that in time, those parties who are not yet supportive will ultimately shift their focus to the critical resources that the settlement provides to people and problems that need them,"" they said.    Key issues that could be decided include whether the suits against the Sacklers in state courts will be able to move ahead, and what will happen to the company itself. Under the tentative settlement deal, it would continue to operate, but with profits used to pay for the settlement. Another option could be for a judge to order it be sold.  Court filings assert that members of the Sackler family were paid more than $4 billion by Purdue from 2007 to 2018. Much of the family's fortune is believed to be held outside the U.S., which could complicate lawsuits against the family over opioids.  A court filing by the New York Attorney General's office on Friday contended that Sackler family members used Swiss and other hidden accounts to transfer $1 billion to themselves. The discovery of the transfers bolsters several states' claims that family members worked to shield its wealth because of the growing legal threats against them and Purdue.  The Sacklers have given money to cultural institutions around the world, including the Smithsonian Institution, New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art and London's Tate Modern.",health
4,'Not one shred of scientific evidence': Critics say psych reports in custody cases can hurt kids,"When a Vancouver-area mother read a psychologist's recommendations for custody of her young daughter, she started hyperventilating at work.  Dr. Allan Posthuma was recommending the courts grant sole guardianship to her ex, a man with a previous conviction for domestic violence who'd had multiple run-ins with police.  ""I was frantic. I was scared that they were going to take her away. I was thinking about all the things that would have happened to her,"" the mother remembered in a recent interview. CBC is not naming her to protect the privacy of her daughter.  Investigators with the College of Psychologists of B.C. allege that Posthuma failed to properly consider documented issues with violence when he evaluated the family.   The allegation hasn't been proven, but some critics say this isn't an isolated problem. They argue that the court-ordered psychological assessments used in family legal disputes across North America are inherently flawed and can cause serious harm for children and families.    ""To the best of my knowledge, there is not one shred of scientific evidence that child custody evaluations benefit children, and most unfortunately there have been cases where the psychologists' recommendations to the court endorsed parents who later killed their own children,"" Florida psychologist Dr. Ira Turkat told CBC.  He made it clear that he could not comment on Posthuma's case, but Turkat has been arguing against the use of these evaluations for more than a decade. He outlined his case last year in a piece published in the American Journal of Family Law, pointing out instances in Virginia, Maryland and California where parents have killed their children after courts granted custody or visitation rights in response to psychologists' recommendations.  Child homicides are at the extreme end of potential consequences for a misguided psychological assessment, but critics in B.C. remain deeply concerned about the potential damages.  Family violence not fully addressed  Under the Family Law Act, these custody and access reports are known as Section 211 assessments. They're ordered by judges to help make decisions in contentious family disputes, and can be performed by independent psychologists like Posthuma or family justice counsellors employed by the province.  These assessments are currently under the microscope as part of a federal government-funded research project examining the legal system's response to family violence, according to Haley Hrymak, a research lawyer with Rise Women's Legal Centre.  She told CBC that many psychologists and counsellors don't fully consider the issue of domestic violence when they're making their recommendations. Sometimes, they don't ask any questions about whether anyone in the family has been violent, she said.    ""Obviously, the presence of family violence has a major impact on the best interests of the children, but our research suggests that it is not always being captured or addressed,"" Hrymak said.  Researchers from Rise and the Centre for Response-Based Practice have been poring over Section 211 reports and interviewing women who've been assessed.  Many of the women report that the psychologists and counsellors they've dealt with have been dismissive of their concerns about an ex-partner, even concluding they are not fit to have custody of their children.    ""These women are frequently sitting down with the report writer and they have genuine fears and concerns about their violent ex-spouse,"" Hrymak said.  ""But instead, the woman may be described as paranoid because of a multiple-choice questionnaire they filled out on a computer.""  The research has also raised concerns about the cost of Section 211 assessments, which can be as high as $20,000 or $30,000, Hrymak said. That total doesn't include the expense of undergoing any counselling or follow-up assessments recommended by a psychologist.    ""I've spoken with women who have spent over $100,000 simply on this piece of their litigation, and ultimately are in a financial crisis as a result of that,"" Hrymak said.  She wants to see changes in legislation to make sure discussions of family violence are included in all Section 211 reports, and and to require psychologists to complete training on the subject.  'Custody evaluations may be helpful'  These psychological assessments do have strong defenders.  Dr. Allan Posthuma is one, and he wrote a counterpoint to Turkat's arguments in a 2016 article in the publication Court Review.  Posthuma and his co-author Jonathan Gould agreed that more research is needed on the impact of psychological assessments on families, but said that doesn't necessarily mean they're harmful.    ""Since there is no empirical examination of the short- and long-term effects of expert opinions regarding custodial placement and decision making on judicial determinations, it is just as easy to argue that custody evaluations may be helpful,"" they wrote.  Posthuma's lawyer, Michael Schalke, told CBC that his client is satisfied with his record. He did not respond to a request for comment about suggestions that Section 211 assessments can be harmful.",health
5,Attack on Saudi oil facilities highlights danger of 'kamikaze' drones,"The recent attack on Saudi oil facilities has cast a spotlight on an increasingly used but often misunderstood piece of combat technology: ""kamikaze"" or ""suicide"" drones.  And the incident has brought into focus what one expert calls the ""eminent"" possibility of such devices one day being used to sow terror in major cities.  The strikes on the Saudi Aramco plants last Saturday involved some 20 drones and several cruise missiles, U.S. officials have reportedly said. Although drone attacks have been carried out before in the region, this effort significantly disrupted Saudi Arabia's oil capacity, marking an escalation in their scale of destruction.  Houthi rebels — aligned with Iran and battling the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen's civil war — quickly took responsibility for the strikes. U.S. officials blamed Iran, but Tehran rejected the claim.   On Wednesday, a Saudi defence ministry spokesperson identified the drones as Iranian delta-wing unmanned aerial vehicles, and presented at a news conference remnants of drones and missiles. But an adviser to Iran's president said the news conference ""proved that Saudi Arabia knows nothing about where the missiles and drones were made or launched from.""  While it's not entirely clear who's responsible, it is known that since 2018, the Houthis have obtained advanced drones capable of attacks beyond Yemen's borders, according to a UN Security Council report released last January.     Device 'shrouded in mystery'  Identifying the devices as UAV-X (unmanned aerial vehicle X), the report said they could fly 1,500 kilometres and travel at speeds of up to 250 kmu002Fh.  What's more, the device can carry a warhead made up of 18 kilograms of explosives and ball bearings, making it potentially more lethal than other Houthi-owned drones, the UN report warned.  Known broadly in the industry as ""loitering munitions"" for their common ability to stop mid-air and wait for a target, the category of devices is also referred to as kamikaze or suicide drones. They're normally destroyed themselves while mounting an attack.    As for the UAV-X, it can also be used in reconnaissance missions to gather intelligence at a distance. Among the debris of one such device, the UN's panel of experts found the lens from a Nikon D810, a widely-available, professional-grade digital camera.  Beyond that, the device is ""somewhat shrouded in mystery,"" said Arthur Holland Michel, co-director of the Center for the Study of the Drone at Bard College.    Despite the secrecy around the UAV-X, Holland Michel said, ""I wouldn't be surprised if something like the loitering munitions used by the Houthis did become somewhat widely accessible in three to five years.""  Military-grade drones, especially those deployed by the United States, have been best known for use in surveillance operations and targeted killings from thousands of kilometres away.  They bear almost no resemblance to the off-the-shelf devices available at stores. Instead, the UAV-X is shaped more like a jet with a wingspan of 4.5 metres — roughly the length of a sedan.  Hard to detect  Air defence systems often aren't calibrated to detect loitering munitions, which fly at lower altitudes and speeds than ballistic missiles and military aircraft. The result is the drones may only be spotted from a shorter distance, according to Justin Bronk, a research fellow at London's Royal United Services Institute (RUSI).  Bronk said anti-drone systems generally involve guns shooting down the devices. The systems aren't ideal; they run out of ammunition and can easily be overwhelmed by multiple incoming targets at once.    ""There is no perfect answer,"" he said.  Much of the damage caused in last weekend's attack may be due to the use of missiles, rather than drones. Loitering munitions still can't handle the same size of weaponry as larger missiles.  But the number of devices deployed appears to underscore the difficulty in defending against such a co-ordinated operation.   ""The co-ordination of those [drones] would not be entirely simple,"" said Craig Martin, a professor at the Washburn University School of Law. But compared to other weapon systems, ""they're relatively cheap.""  Martin wrote an essay about Canada's planned acquisition of armed drones. (The Royal Canadian Air Force hopes to purchase armed drones for domestic and overseas use within six years, The Canadian Press reported in February.)    In a telephone interview, Martin estimated the drone attack in Saudi Arabia would have cost ""tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars."" He said that's much less than Riyadh's $1 million US or more spent to deploy a single Patriot surface-to-air missile as a means of defending against Houthi threats.  RUSI's Bronk said, ""The price of entry"" isn't very high. And ""it does potentially give small groups or countries long range, fairly accurate, precision strike capabilities.""  He said the use of loitering munitions isn't new, but their prices have dropped and freely-available GPS data has made them easier to program for use on a specific target. A quick search on Google Maps, for instance, reveals the exact location of Saudi oil facilities.  The drones deployed last Saturday are believed to have been GPS-programmed to hit those exact spots.    'Threat' from consumer-grade drones  Off-the-shelf drones aren't made to carry weapons, but videos shared online appear to show ISIS using such commercial devices to drop grenades in Iraq and Syria.  Speaking to a U.S. Senate panel last year, FBI Director Christopher Wray called the use of civilian drones by criminal groups ""a steadily escalating threat.""  Holland Michel, at the Center for the Study of the Drone, said an attack in a big city involving grenades strapped to drones ""is eminently possible today."" Citing the example of an armed drone flying over a crowded stadium, he called the potential ""very worrying.""    Many countries and major cities, however, have adopted a patchwork of laws banning drones from public areas. And Holland Michel said if a criminal group were to acquire the weapons needed for such an attack, it would raise a red flag among security services.  ""We don't want people thinking this kind of Houthi drone attack is possible tomorrow in Toronto.""",technology
6,"Incredibly rare, centuries-old book on insects returns to Newfoundland","It hasn't been seen in Newfoundland since 1835.  Full of exquisite illustrations by a visiting amateur naturalist, Entomologia Terrae Novae was Phillip Henry Gosse's attempt to chronicle the insect life of Newfoundland.   ""He came from England to Carbonear when he was 17. He came here to be a clerk and while he was here, he created this beautiful book,"" said Elizabeth Smith, acquisitions and cataloging officer with the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa.  The book is the first known attempt to classify bug life in the province, and was flown into St. John's for public viewing this week from its usual spot in Ottawa. Featuring more than 250 paintings, the piece is on display at the Centre for Newfoundland Studies.  The rare object cannot be touched by the public, and special gloves have to be  worn to handle it; it was a stressful ordeal for Smith to even transport it to Newfoundland on an airplane.     Gosse wasn't a formally trained illustrator, but his artwork is impressive nonetheless.  ""His father was a miniature portrait artist, based on the research I did about him. It was his aunt who was responsible for teaching him how to draw,"" said Smith.      When you look at it live with your own eyes… it looks real.  - Elizabeth Smith     ""When you look at it live with your own eyes … it looks real, it's in 3D. The texture, the butterflies look velvety. And it's absolutely exquisite,"" said Smith.  The dates assigned to the drawings vary throughout the book, revealing that Gosse was simply jotting down pictures of fauna as he came across them during his stay. Carrying the journal with him as he travelled, he would document whichever creature caught his eye.    Like a hiker visiting Newfoundland today, Gosse was simply marvelling at the nature he encountered and attempting to memorialize it, just as a tourist would use a cellphone to take pictures during a trip.  Gosse didn't stick around Newfoundland forever, though. When he left, his work did as well.    ""I think from what we know the book went on and was kept with family for a while until it was passed along from Philip Henry Gosse to his son Edmund Gosse, and Edmund Gosse passed it along to his son Philip. And from there it it remained in the family for a while until it was donated to the museum in the 1950s,"" Smith told CBC Radio's On the Go.  Gosse's work didn't end with his trip to the Rock.  ""He moves on to Quebec and Alabama … and he moves on to explore other life forms — in fact, some of which he was more famous for. It is said that he invented the word 'aquarium,'"" said Smith.  ""Interestingly, in this book the very last page is a sketch of dolphins.… It almost teases you into the next chapter of his of his profession, of his life.""  You can see that dolphin illustration for yourself Friday at the Centre for Newfoundland Studies in Memorial University.  You aren't allowed to touch it, though.

7,Untested legal options could give feds ways to intervene on Bill 21,"National party leaders' reluctance to intervene in a court challenge to Quebec's controversial Bill 21 may have left the erroneous impression that there's nothing the federal government can do to try to stop the law that bans teachers, police and certain other public servants from wearing religious symbols at work.  The Quebec government has, after all, invoked the Constitution's notwithstanding clause to prevent its secularism law from being struck down as a violation of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  But while use of the notwithstanding clause makes a court challenge more difficult, constitutional experts say it does not necessarily provide a blanket shield against charter challenges, nor does it prevent the federal government from pursuing other legal avenues.    ""There are legal bases for challenging the law that are not touched by the notwithstanding clause at all,"" says Robert Leckey, dean of law at McGill University.  Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau is the only national leader to leave the door open to a possible intervention by the federal government some day, although he says it would be ""counterproductive"" to do so now when a challenge by two civil rights groups is before Quebec's Superior Court.  Other than Trudeau, federal leaders seem happy to heed Quebec Premier Francois Legault's admonition to butt out.  All about jurisdiction  The Conservatives' Andrew Scheer, the NDP's Jagmeet Singh and the Greens' Elizabeth May have said they would not intervene to challenge the law, which they've nevertheless deplored. People's Party Leader Maxime Bernier has chided his fellow federal leaders for even talking about something he deems to be entirely Quebec's business.  All the tip-toeing around Bill 21 is no doubt primarily a reflection of the fact that Bill 21 is overwhelmingly popular in Quebec, a province that will be pivotal to the outcome of the Oct. 21 federal election.  But it may also reflect the fact that the legal options available after Quebec's use of the notwithstanding clause are untested. As the only federal leader who hasn't slammed the door on intervening, Trudeau may want to see how some of the arguments fare in court before deciding whether to take the plunge.  ""Unless you can persuade courts to breach new legal ground, there really isn't an obvious resolution,"" says University of Ottawa law professor Carissima Mathen.  ""There are some new arguments that have been raised by some scholars but it would be unprecedented so the court would have to be persuaded. I think people agree it would be an uphill climb.""    Still, Leckey says the courts have in the past found creative ways to address laws that judges have deemed ""deeply unjust.""  ""I think we'll see people trying arguments that have not been used because they've not been needed before,"" he adds.  Section 33 of the charter provides that a legislature may declare that a law will operate notwithstanding certain rights and freedoms otherwise guaranteed in the Charter of Rights.  One argument now being advanced is based on the fact that the clause applies only to some sections of the charter. Important ones, sections that cover fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of religion, legal rights and equality rights, but not the entire thing.  The notwithstanding clause cannot be used to shield a law from other provisions of the charter, such as Section 28, which specifies that the rights and freedoms referred to in the charter are ""guaranteed equally to male and female persons.""  Varying opinions on charter sections  Because the secularism law affects Muslim women disproportionately, forbidding practically any distinctive clothing such as hijabs, Leckey says the courts might be persuaded that it violates Section 28.  Mathen believes that ""would be a tough sell"" because Section 28 has generally been seen as an interpretive guide to the charter, not as conferring a stand-alone right.  Another argument revives Supreme Court rulings from the middle of the 20th century, in which the top court ruled that provincial laws limiting religious freedom were a matter of criminal law and, as such, could only be enacted by the federal government.  However, Mathen notes those rulings were made before the charter was enshrined in the Constitution in 1982. She doubts the courts would consider resurrecting them now.  Other arguments being advanced revolve around two unwritten principles that underlie the Constitution — the rule of law and protection of minority rights, both of which, Leckey notes, were specifically recognized by the Supreme Court in the 1998 reference on the legality of Quebec secession.    Leckey also argues that even if the notwithstanding clause ultimately prevents the court from striking down Bill 21, the wording of the clause doesn't preclude the court from issuing a judgment on the law. A damning ruling could have an impact on public opinion and dissuade the Quebec government from renewing its use of the notwithstanding clause in five years, as required by the Constitution.  Then there's the nuclear option: the federal government could use its constitutional power of disallowance to invalidate the law, a power that hasn't been used in 75 years. At Confederation, the federal cabinet was given the authority to invalidate provincial laws, typically when they were against the national interest in some way or stepped on federal jurisdiction.  The power was once used fairly freely but the last time was in 1943, on an Alberta law that forbade land sales to Hutterites and ""enemy aliens"" in the Second World War.  Mathen says that would be ""beyond the pale"" and would likely ""provoke a crisis in terms of federal-provincial relations; not just Quebec would object to that.""",politics
8,Do parties even have to put out a platform? Your election questions as Week 2 begins,"We've been hearing from voters across the country and expats around the world curious about all aspects of the upcoming federal election.   As leaders criss-cross the country, curiosity has been piqued. Here's what you were asking as the campaign entered its second week.  Do parties even have to put out a platform?  Technically no — though it's traditional for parties to put out some form of reading material. The NDP got their platform document out first, while the Greens and the Bloc just released theirs this week. We're still waiting on full releases from the Liberals, the Conservatives and the People's Party — they promise they will come in the next few weeks.  So what's the holdup? Alex Marland, a political science professor at Memorial University, said these documents take a long time to put together. He thinks the incumbent government could be at a disadvantage.  ""When you are in government, you're sticking around, doing more of the same,"" he said. So a platform can become a regurgitation of what you've already done or promised rather than specific new policy.  Former NDP Leader Jack Layton famously grilled then prime minister Stephen Harper during a 2008 election debate asking ""Where's your platform? Under the sweater?""    This is also the first year the Parliamentary Budget Officer is costing out party promises. Some parties are making use of that service in tandem with announcing policy, yet another step to take before going public.     Everyone might not have a full platform yet but we've still compared what's available    Who is allowed to use the term re-elect on campaign signs?   We've been flagged multiple times to Conservative candidate Stephen Woodworth's signs in Kitchener Centre. They've got ""re-elect"" on them. Woodworth was MP in the riding for seven years. The only problem is he's not the incumbent.  While some consider this misleading, what's on the sign does not fall under Elections Canada's purview. The Elections Act ""does not regulate the content of campaign signs"" in most circumstances. When we inquired, Elections Canada instead referred us to ""the candidates and political parties.""  In Woodworth's words: ""It would be underestimating the intelligence of the electorate to suggest that anyone believes that I'm the incumbent. People are better informed than that.""  There is some level of oversight from the Commissioner of Canada Elections, who deals with election sign complaints. If you have a problem with a sign, you can complain to the commissioner's office, which will look into each complaint on a case-by-case basis and see if it contravenes the Elections Act. That includes advertisements with certain types of false statements. Penalties can include fines or even charges.  The office would not comment on ""the legality of a specific issue."" ""We tend not to be looking at the content per se unless it meets specific criteria,"" said Michelle Laliberté, a spokesperson for the Commissioner's office.    I live in an apartmentu002Fcondo. Can I put up a lawn sign?  Yes — though you may not have a lawn, you still can put up a lawn sign.  If you're leasing, your property owners or the corporation can't prevent you from putting a sign up in your apartment or condo. Same rules apply if you own the unit.  However, there can be restrictions around how big the signs can be and whether they are allowed in common areas — so keep that in mind when you're picking a place for your sign.  How do I vote if I'm not at home during the voting period?   It's the most common question we've gotten since the election was called — we've heard stories about those who will be out of riding, out of province, even those temporarily living in places like the U.S. and Ukraine (shout out to the parents getting details for their travelling children!).  How you vote all depends on where you will be throughout the election period. If you are around through Oct. 15, you can go and vote for your riding at any Elections Canada office. Or you can vote in the advanced polls Oct. 11 through 14.  If you aren't around for any of that, you can vote by mail, which you can apply to do right now. If you're away, just make sure to give an address you know you'll be at so you can receive your voting kit.     Get more answers to questions about how to vote in our Voter Guide      Can you vote if you're on house arrest?  Yes, but how you do it depends on the conditions of your house arrest.  For those who are allowed to leave the house, you can vote during advance polling, on election day or at any Elections Canada office before Oct. 15. But if you're not allowed to leave home, you'll have to vote by mail. You can sign up to get a ballot kit sent to you now.  How do I vote none of the above if I don't trust any of the candidates?  You can't. None of the above isn't an option federally. There is no process for protesting or refusing a ballot in federal elections, like there is in some provincial and territorial elections.  If you go behind the voter screen and vote for no one or write none of the above on your ballot, your vote will be counted as a rejected ballot. Same deal if you refuse to go into a polling booth and hand back an unmarked ballot immediately.  These rejected ballots are included in the final vote count; there were 120,515 rejected nationally in 2015. However, they can't be considered votes for no one because many types of ballots are counted as rejected, including ones with multiple votes and ones that are improperly marked.  So, by percentage, which province has the most rejected ballots?  That would be Quebec — no other province or territory even comes close. More than 1.4 per cent of Quebecers had their ballots rejected in the 2015 election, equivalent to 62,271 votes.   In some ridings, the numbers were even higher. The Bloc Quebecois-held constituency of Montcalm was not only the Quebec riding with the highest percentage of rejected, it also had the highest percentage countrywide.  Almost 2.3 per cent of all votes, 1,226 of them, were rejected there.  And in case you want more:     Why isn't CBC News calling Justin Trudeau prime minister?

9,Liberals to re-record French version of campaign theme song after hitting sour note,"Are the Liberals removing one hand for tomorrow?   That's what some say the new French-language version of the federal party's theme song implies.  The English version of One Hand Up, recorded by The Strumbellas, goes, ""We can hold one hand up for tomorrow. We can hold one hand up to the stars.""  In French, the same line translates as: ""On lève une main haute pour demain. On lève une main haute aux étoiles.""  But instead of ""on lève,"" which means ""we raise,"" some say they hear ""enlève,"" which means to remove.  While that misunderstanding may boil down to mispronunciation, other parts of the song make little sense in French, critics say.  ""Google Translate does not sing,"" one Twitter user, Lyne Labrèche, wrote to Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau on Sunday.  ""I repeat, Google Translate does not sing.""  The criticism appears to have had an effect. The Liberals said early Monday they are planning to record a new version of the song.  The song first appeared in English on the Ontario band's Rattlesnake album released earlier this year.  The French version of the song, posted in a short video clip to social media by the Liberals, has been viewed more than 100,000 times since it was released Sunday morning.    The Liberals say it was translated by the band for the campaign.  MNA Gaétan Barrette, a member of the Quebec Liberal Party, slammed the song on Twitter.  ""I listened to it a dozen times and I have not yet understood all the lyrics,"" he wrote, calling it a ""very bad French translation that is very, very, very embarrassing.""",entertainment
10,Cameron Ortis back in court Sept. 27 on spy charges,"The lawyer for Cameron Ortis, the RCMP intelligence director accused of preparing to share classified secrets, says he's still waiting for key information.  Last week, Cameron Ortis, 47, was charged under the Security of Information Act.  The director general of the RCMP's national intelligence co-ordination centre is accused of preparing to share sensitive information with a foreign entity or terrorist organization. He's also charged with sharing operational information back in 2015.  Defence lawyer Ian Carter said he only has an initial synopsis of the case against Ortis and is expecting to receive more disclosure early next week.    Ortis, who appeared in court today by video in an orange jumpsuit and thick dark-rimmed glasses, will be back in court Sept. 27 to set a bail hearing.  He was solemn and quiet, saying only ""Yes, your honour I understand,"" and ""Thank you.""  RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki has called the allegations ""extremely unsettling.""  According to documents viewed by CBC, the cache of classified intelligence material Ortis allegedly was preparing to share is so vital to Canada's national security that the country's intelligence agencies say its misuse would strike at the heart of Canada's security.",politics
11,"One year after a ruling in their favour, Loblaws delivery drivers still waiting for overtime pay","On a good day, Faisel Osman gets back to his home in Kitchener, Ont., early enough to see his four children before bedtime. But with a shift that starts at 10 a.m. — and runs anywhere from 10 to 12 hours — that doesn't always happen.  ""It's kind of tough. If I come early, maybe before they get sleep, I get to spend a little bit of time with them,"" said Osman, a 36-year-old delivery driver for Loblaws.  For the past six years, he has worked out of the company's Maple Grove distribution centre in Cambridge, Ont., spending his days driving to places like Mississauga, Woodstock or even as far as London, about 1.5 hours away. Despite the long work days, Osman is only paid overtime if he works more than 60 hours a week.  Last September, an arbitrator ruled this practice violates Ontario's Employment Standards Act (ESA), which requires employees to receive overtime pay after working 44 hours a week. But one year after that decision came down, Loblaws has not changed the way it pays its Cambridge distribution centre drivers, nor has it paid employees any back wages.    No one from Loblaws would agree to an interview with CBC News. But in a statement, the company said it's been operating for close to a decade under a collective agreement with the union and drivers.  ""Recently, specific overtime compensation details were challenged. That disagreement continues,"" the statement reads.  Additional overtime pay — which is 1.5 times the employee's regular hourly rate — is something that Osman said would translate into hundreds of extra dollars a month for him — money he could use as the sole breadwinner for his growing family. His wife is due with their fifth child in December.  ""It's very hard now these days … you try your best with whatever you can to survive,"" said Osman. ""Loblaws is the biggest [grocery] company in Canada.… They can do better than this.""  Initial grievance  The grievance against Loblaws was filed in 2014 by Trevor Enos, a driver who has 35 years with the company. Like Osman, he works out of the Maple Grove distribution centre in Cambridge.   ""I went from a 52-hour week to a 60-hour a week, to make $15,000 a year less,"" said Enos. Prior to 2010, he said, drivers were paid overtime once they worked over the provincially designated minimum.  What changed in 2010? The union that represents the drivers — UFCW 1006A — and its members went through collective bargaining and signed a new contract with Loblaws. It included the 60-hour provision in addition to a host of other changes, like ""activity-based compensation,"" which pays drivers based on specific work assignments as opposed to straight hours of work.    Like Osman, Enos said he loves his job, his team and working for the company. But he said he filed the grievance because of the impact it was having on junior drivers who have a much lower hourly wage and used to rely heavily on overtime pay.   ""They say, 'Trevor, you know I can't make enough money. I'm struggling.' That's hard,"" Enos said.  Other drivers, like Hamilton resident Peter Simon, say they've had to find second jobs over the years to make ends meet.  ""I've had to do other stuff on the side to take care of myself,"" said Simon, who has worked for the company since 2002, also out of the Cambridge distribution centre.  Roughly six months after the overtime rules changed in 2010, Simon started taking up construction jobs to supplement his income.  ""You're getting paid for your 14-hour days, but you're not really getting paid for your true 14, with the overtime itself,"" he said ""With that, you're looking at a good little chunk of money right there, whether it's an extra $200 or $300 a week itself. Over the period of time, it all adds up.""    In arbitration hearings, Loblaws argued that drivers at the Cambridge distribution centre are exempt from ESA rules because they fall under the category of highway transport drivers, who can work up to 60 hours a week before overtime kicks in.   After four years of hearings, arbitrator Gordon F. Luborsky ruled the drivers' job duties did fall under the ESA, therefore entitling drivers to overtime pay after working more than 44 hours.  Luborsky didn't outline, however, how much Loblaws should pay in back wages or offer any guidance on that matter. He instead insisted both sides work together on a settlement.  One year later, no settlement has been reached and Loblaws is now challenging the arbitrator's decision. The company has filed a judicial review and wants an Ontario Divisional Court judge to quash the decision.  ""Loblaws seems to want to drag this out because of the money that is involved here. We're talking hundreds of thousands of dollars,"" said Wayne Hanley, president of UFCW 1006A.  The union continues to press the company to pay up, Hanley said, but it seems like there's a lack of urgency to resolve the issue.  ""That's unfair and we would encourage Loblaws to come to the table and have some progressive talks on how this can be remedied,"" he said.   'This is going to impact thousands of employees'  Sunira Chaudhri, a partner with Levitt LLP, said it's not often that you see a union matter like this escalate to the point of a judicial review — because the whole point of a collective agreement is for unions and management to work together to resolve a grievance.  Chaudhri said the arbitration decision is an affirmation that it doesn't matter what two sides agree to — in this case, a 60-hour work week before overtime is given — if it's a violation of the ESA, it's not enforceable.    ""[This decision is] a reminder that you can't contract out of legislation — minimum legislation — in this province and in this country,"" she said.   Chaudhri also suggested that others are going to be looking at this decision closely.  ""I think it's unequivocal that this case is going to lead to other unions taking a closer look at the Employment Standards Act and making sure that employers are definitely at least meeting the minimums,"" she said.  ""This is going to impact thousands of employees — if not hundreds of thousands — in terms of employees that might be looking to a decision like this to get them overtime pay sooner.""  A spokesperson with Teamsters Local 91, an Ottawa-based union that represents Loblaws drivers in that city, told CBC News it has followed the lead of Trevor Enos and UFCW 1006A, filing a grievance that argues its 67 drivers are not being paid overtime beyond 44 hours. The grievance was filed just two months after last September's decision from the arbitrator in the Cambridge case.     Loblaws has different agreements with different drivers in different regions. In New Brunswick, for example, its 60 drivers are represented by the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers' International Union (BCTGM). A union member told CBC News that they're not paid overtime at all unless they work a statutory holiday.  Loblaws statement  In a statement to CBC News, Loblaws said it has calculated the disputed overtime money owed since last September's decision and has set it aside.  ""[We] are paying that into a trust account as we await the final determination by the Court,"" the statement read.  The company wouldn't answer questions about how much money is in that trust or how it calculated the amount.  That's no consolation to drivers' and union steward Roger Siroky, who just wants to see the company follow the arbitrator's ruling.  ""I would like to see the drivers being paid overtime starting next week as step one,"" he said. ""I don't know how an award can come down and them not [pay] it.""",business
12,"In some battleground ridings, renters spend 50% or more of income on housing","Housing affordability is poised to be a major ballot box issue in the upcoming federal election, with a sizeable portion of renters in some of the country's battleground ridings spending half or more of their income on housing.  An analysis of the numbers in Statistics Canada's 2016 long-form census that examined income, affordability and overcrowding across Canada's 338 federal electoral districts shows that five of the country's worst ridings for rental housing affordability also happen to be among the ridings with the tightest races between the parties.  Of the 20 ridings with the toughest affordability challenges, 11 are in Ontario and six are in British Columbia, with Nova Scotia, Quebec and Manitoba rounding out the list with one riding each, according to the 2019 Canadian Rental Housing Index, released Tuesday.    In those ridings, a quarter or more of renters reported spending at least 50 per cent of their income on rent and utilities. (Utilities were included in rent figures because the data didn't allow for costs to be separated out, according to the index.)  ""These numbers clearly demonstrate why Canadians and housing advocates have been calling on our political leaders to take more immediate action to address the affordability challenges impacting so many families and individuals across the country,"" said Jill Atkey, CEO of the BC Non-Profit Housing Association, in a news release.  ""Whichever party forms the next government will need to increase the investments into the National Housing Strategy in order to achieve its goals before this crisis gets even worse.""  5 swing ridings on the list  Of the ridings identified in the index, Willowdale in Toronto was the worst for rental affordability; 39 per cent of renters there reported spending half or more of their income toward rent.  CBC News has identified five swing ridings on StatsCanada's top-20 list for costly housing: Richmond Hill, King-Vaughan, Aurora-Oak Ridges-Richmond Hill and Don Valley North in Ontario; and Burnaby North-Seymour in B.C.  The other Ontario ridings on the list are:     Thornhill   Markham-Unionville   University Rosedale   Mississauga Centre   Toronto Centre   Waterloo    In British Columbia:     Vancouver Quadra   Richmond Centre   West-Vancouver-Sunshine Coast-Sea to Sky Country   Vancouver Centre   Burnaby South.     Rounding out the list are Ville-Marie-Le Sud Ouest-Île-des-Soeurs in Quebec, Halifax in Nova Scotia and Winnipeg South in Manitoba.   Affordability issues not lost on federal leaders  The crisis of affordability in some markets hasn't been lost on campaigning party leaders. Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau promised last week to provide more help to first first-time homebuyers living in red-hot housing markets, including Toronto and Vancouver.  The Liberal plan would expand the number of first-time buyers eligible under the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation's shared-equity program by increasing the value of a qualifying home from approximately $500,000 to nearly $800,000.  Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer plans to offer his own proposal on home ownership, according to the party's spokesperson.       The data clearly demonstrates that our political leaders have not been able to find or implement meaningful solutions to the affordable housing crisis.  - Jeff Morrison, Canadian Housing and Renewal Association     Whether the leaders will come out with campaign commitments specifically aimed at renters remains to be seen.  ""The data clearly demonstrates that our political leaders have not been able to find or implement meaningful solutions to the affordable housing crisis, and Ontario now has the dubious honour of being harder hit than anywhere else in the country,"" said Marlene Coffey, executive director of the Ontario Non-Profit Housing Association.  The index released Tuesday also paints a picture of those hardest hit by affordability challenges: single mothers, Indigenous renters, new immigrants, seniors and Canadians under 30.  That last group is comprised largely of millennials, who are expected to make up as much as 37 per cent of the electorate in this election, according to Abacus Data.  Nearly a quarter of renters under 30 are at what the index defines as a ""crisis level of spending,"" with half or more of their income going to rent — while at least half of seniors who rent spent 30 per cent or more of their income on housing.  'Vulnerable groups are bearing the brunt'  ""For a long time, the conversation around rental housing affordability in Canada has focused on the population as a whole, but the numbers clearly show several key, vulnerable groups are bearing the brunt of this crisis,"" said Jeff Morrison, executive director of the Canadian Housing and Renewal Association.    A disproportionate share of Indigenous families were also found to be struggling to pay rent, and overcrowding was found to be an issue in 43 per cent of Indigenous-led renter households, compared with just six per cent in non-Indigenous renter households.  Among immigrants now renting shelter who landed in Canada from 2011 to 2016, nearly 24 per cent were found to be at a crisis level in terms of the percentage of household income spent on shelter. In terms of overcrowding and overspending, the hardest hit immigrant-led households are in the Greater Toronto Area, with 55 to 60 per cent of those households in Richmond Hill, Vaughan and Markham spending 30 per cent or more of their income on rent.  But those suburbs still might be the more affordable option for those looking to own a home in Toronto — people like new mom Jessica Botello.    Botello said she's encouraged by Trudeau's housing proposal but thinks ultimately it's better suited to those looking outside the city core.    ""Honestly, it's a great idea, but for $800,000, it's not realistic for Toronto,"" she told CBC Radio's Metro Morning.  Botello recently put in an offer for a home in Toronto, only to find six others did as well. Ultimately, the home sold for $840,000 — a price she said she simply couldn't compete with.  ""We were pre-approved for $745,000,"" she told Metro Morning. ""But if it's listed for that price, they want multiple offers — and they get them.""    What matters to you this election?

13,Federal public servants warned about online posts while in 'caretaker' mode,"The country's top civil servant is sending a stern warning to government workers as part of his election campaign guidelines, reminding them to be extra careful about what they say on social media.  The ""caretaker convention"" rules are circulated internally at the start of every federal election campaign and this is the second time the Privy Council Office has posted the document online for public consumption.  The guidelines set out the rules federal civil servants need to follow to avoid any hint of partisanship in a politically charged election campaign.  While civil servants aren't banned from spending their private time helping any candidate or party, the guidelines say, they should make sure any political activity doesn't ""impair or could be perceived as impairing"" their ability to work impartially for any party that forms government — including an ill-advised tweet, Instagram or Facebook post.  ""Employees should consider the nature of their current public-service duties, the level and visibility of their position, the nature of the political activity and their personal visibility,"" the guidelines say as part of a new addition to the document.  ""Particular attention should be paid to potentially highly visible public activities, notably the use of personal social media accounts.""  Deleted departmental tweet  A spokesperson for the Privy Council Office, the central bureaucracy that aids the prime minister and cabinet, said the warning was added this year ""given the role of social media during an election campaign.""  Officials had a recent reminder of that when a federal Twitter account tweeted, then deleted, a post about anti-racism strategy spending in the hours after images emerged of Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau in blackface when he was a young man.     Leaders talk financial relief, but Trudeau still quizzed over blackface scandal   Why wearing blackface or brownface is considered 'reprehensible'    Most government promotion comes to a grinding halt during an election period, lest it be seen as promoting the party seeking re-election.  The Privy Council Office said the tweet on Thursday stemmed from a correction Canadian Heritage made to an online version of a news release.  The news release was originally sent on Sept. 6 before the campaign kicked off, and noted a funding pledge of about $3.5 million when the correct amount was $3.25 million.  The correction created a revised tweet, ""making it appear as though this was a new funding announcement, which it was not,"" PCO spokesman Stephane Shank said Friday.  So PCO asked the department to delete the tweet ""given the possible perception"" of new spending commitments.    Governments are expected to act with restraint until after election day and MPs convene in Ottawa again, because even if the government appears to have been re-elected, it can't assume it will have the confidence of the House of Commons while there is no elected chamber to say so.  The prime minister and cabinet retain their positions to do routine business and respond to emergencies, although any major decisions are usually done in consultation with opposition parties — an issue spelled out in the 2019 ""caretaker"" guidelines.  While most of the 2019 guidelines mirror the 2015 document, there are some additions aside from the warning about social-media use.  Departments are told they can implement regulations approved before Parliament's dissolution, but should be more ""reactive as opposed to proactive"" when it comes to communicating with affected groups or organizations.  Regulatory initiatives that are ""high-profile or controversial"" should be avoided as much as possible, this year's guidelines say.  There is also a section on what happens if there is any attempt by foreign actors to manipulate the results of the Oct. 21 vote.  A panel of top civil servants have been tasked with alerting the public should such a situation arise.",technology
14,"Vapes need same restrictions as tobacco, medical groups tell federal parties","There's an urgent need for vaping products to be given the same advertising and flavour restrictions as tobacco, a group of health organizations in Canada said in calling for immediate political action.  The appeal came Thursday at a news conference in Ottawa from representatives of:     Action on Smoking and Health.   Canadian Cancer Society.   Canadian Medical Association.   Canadian Lung Association.   Coalition québécoise pour le contrôle du tabac.   Heart &amp; Stroke.   Ontario Campaign for Action on Tobacco.   Physicians for a Smoke-Free Canada.    ""We've just unleashed a torrent of addiction amongst young people in Canada through our thoughtless disregard of the need for effective regulation of these products,"" Dr. Andrew Pipe, Heart &amp; Stroke board chair and a smoking cessation physician in Ottawa, said in an interview. ""Now we're playing catch-up in Canada, and we're in an almost unforgivable situation.""  On Wednesday, health officials in London, Ont., announced what's believed to be the first case in Canada of a respiratory illness linked to vaping. The high-school-age individual used e-cigarettes daily, was initially on life-support and is now recovering at home.  The key missing piece of information in London's case is what was in the cartridge, said Dr. Samir Gupta, a respirologist and associate professor in the department of medicine at the University of Toronto.  Public hospitals in Ontario have been asked to provide the province's chief medical officer of health with statistical, non-identifying information related to incidences of vaping-related severe pulmonary disease.  ""Clinicians have reported to Toronto Public Health [TPH] that they had encountered a small number of patients in recent weeks who potentially had vaping-related severe illness,"" Dr. Michael Finkelstein, Toronto's associate medical officer of health, said in an emailed statement.  TPH said it has asked clinicians to ask their patients to share illness-related information. ""We have yet to receive this information,"" Finkelstein said.    The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 530 confirmed and probable cases of lung injury related to e-cigarettes as of Tuesday. The agency said Thursday that based on gender and age information on 373 people, 72 per cent were male and 67 per cent were 18 to 34.   No single device, ingredient, additive or pathway to illness has been identified in the U.S. investigation. Most of the people reported using tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, the main component in cannabis that gives users a high) or both THC and nicotine. Some of the cases have reported using only nicotine, CDC said.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is now investigating more than 150 products and substances and said it has activated its criminal investigations arm to explore the supply chain of vaping products and identify the cause of the illnesses. No individual vapers will be targeted, said Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products.  During the current Canadian election campaign, the health groups involved in Thursday's news conference called on all parties to commit, within 60 days should they form government, to stop promotions for vaping products on television, radio, billboards, public transit hubs, convenience stores, social media, newspapers and other mainstream media.    The groups said manufacturers are allowed to entice youth and non-smokers with attractive flavours, give the products away and have no obligations for nicotine limits or health warnings on packages as in this case for tobacco.  The medical groups want a nicotine level restriction of 20 mgu002FmL similar to in the European Union. The current maximum is 66 mgu002FmL. The U.S. has no nicotine limit for e-cigarette products, said Rob Cunningham, senior policy analyst with the Canadian Cancer Society.   ""We do not need to wait for a death in Canada to warrant action,"" said Terry Dean, CEO of the Canadian Lung Association.    In Ontario, advertising of e-cigarettes is currently permitted in convenience stores and gas stations.  ""Once we understand what the concern is, then we'll look at any steps necessary in order to protect the health of our young people,"" Ontario Health Minister Christine Elliott said Thursday.   Keep on top of symptoms, Health Canada urges  The Canadian Vaping Association said it wants federal, provincial and territorial governments to immediately ban certain marketing. The group said it represents vape store owners, not vaping brands.   Advertising ""must be removed from all convenience stores, gas stations or any retail location that is not age restricted,"" the association said in a statement.  Health Canada has been urging people who vape to watch for symptoms such as coughing, shortness of breath, fatigue, diarrhea, vomiting and chest pain. It has also said health-care professionals should ask patients about their use of e-cigarette products if they have respiratory symptoms.  Health Canada said Thursday it has consulted on proposed new regulatory measures to further restrict vaping product advertising ""to protect youth from inducements to using these products, including restricting the display of vaping products at points of sale.""  The U.S. media companies CBS, WarnerMedia and Viacom said they'll drop e-cigarette advertising, CNBC reported.   In the U.S., Michigan and New York state have voted to ban flavoured e-cigarettes.",health
15,U.S. strike against GM could lead to Canadian layoffs,"As 49,000 United Auto Workers in the U.S. strike against General Motors, there's a risk the walkout could shut down GM Canada's plants and auto-parts makers in Ontario.  And that means layoffs of some of GM's 5,700 Canadian workers and others throughout the auto sector.  GM Canada says it is monitoring the situation closely for any impact to Canadian operations.  The North American auto industry is highly integrated, with assembly plants here in Canada reliant on parts coming from the U.S. and Mexico.   GM has three plants in Ontario — assembly plants in Ingersoll and Oshawa, and an engine and transmission plant in St. Catharines.  Because the auto supply chain is integrated, Canadian plants could soon be unable to continue working because of a shortage of parts. GM Canada did not say how soon Canadian plants might be affected.  But it could happen quickly. GM uses ""just-in-time"" delivery, which means hundreds of parts are moving across the border every day.   About 80 per cent of the engines St. Catharines is building are destined for cars assembled in the U.S., says Jerry Dias, president of Canadian union Unifor. Workers there could face layoffs within days, he told CBC News.  At the Ingersoll assembly plant, about half the engines they put in cars come from the U.S. Dias estimates they may have to halt operations within 10 days.  GM has not said how many days of parts it has in reserve.  It would be about two months before auto dealerships are affected by a shortage of product, according to the parent company.  Different union, different contract schedule  Canadian workers are represented by a separate union, Unifor, and its contract schedule is different from the U.S. Contracts do not expire until September 2020 and September 2021.  But Unifor issued a statement on Sunday saying it ""supports the UAW in negotiations for a fair contract settlement with General Motors.""  Dias says one of the big issues is how many jobs are being lost to Mexico with its very low wages.  ""We had a dispute with GM in 2017 at the CAMI plant. We thought it would be quick, but it went on for almost a month.  ""The issue was about General Motors' decision to build the Equinox in Mexico. That is what is taking place in the U.S. GM announced the closure of four plants. They're beefing up investment in Mexico and the workers in the U.S., like in Canada, have had enough.""  GM's Oshawa assembly plant is set to close at the end of the year, one of five plants in North America that the auto giant is closing.    That is one of the key issues for the UAW in the U.S., which is pressing GM to schedule new models for the four U.S. plants it is closing.  Unifor has pressed GM Canada unsuccessfully to extend the life of the Oshawa plant, arguing the automaker made a commitment to at least 2020 when it accepted the 2008 government bailout.    GM is negotiating a shift toward more electric cars and investing heavily in automation, considered among the key trends in the auto industry.  North American car sales have boomed in the past three years, but are stagnating this year as young consumers put off owning vehicles.  But GM made $8 billion in profit in 2018 and the UAW is arguing it deserves a wage hike and better benefits to share in the good fortune.  Much depends on length of strike  It's not just GM plants here in Canada, but also other auto-parts makers that could be affected.  That's one reason Flavio Volpe, president of Canada's Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association, hopes the dispute will be quickly resolved.  Within three or four days, it starts affecting people's shifts, Volpe told Bloomberg.  The last strike by the UAW was in 2007, and it only lasted 17 hours, so there was not much impact on Canadian operations.  Before that a strike at just two major parts plants in Flint, Mich., in 1998 that lasted 54 days eventually shut down much of GM's North American operations.  A long strike could have a big impact on Canadian workers. But it might not significantly affect the Canadian and U.S. economy.  If the strike lasts to the end of September, it would take only 0.1 per cent off annualized U.S. GDP growth in the third quarter, according to CIBC economist Avery Shenfeld.  ""Impacts on Canada would be even more modest. Just to give a sense of scale, in the unlikely case where the strike lasts through [the fourth quarter] in its entirety, it would subtract a more meaningful 0.7 per cent off that quarter's annualized pace in the U.S., and take a bit of a shine off Canada as well.""",business
16,"India bans e-cigarettes, dashing Juul and Philip Morris expansion plans","India banned the production, import and sale of electronic cigarettes on Wednesday, a public health decision that will dash the expansion plans of companies such as Juul Labs and Philip Morris International in the country.  The ban will be imposed through an executive order and will include jail terms of up to three years for offenders. It was not clear whether the use of such products would be prohibited.  India's health ministry, which proposed the ban, had said it was needed to ensure e-cigarettes don't become an ""epidemic"" among children and young adults.  ""Considering the seriousness of the impact of e-cigarettes on the youth, the cabinet has approved an ordinance to ban e-cigarettes,"" Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman told a news conference.  India has 106 million adult smokers, second only to China in the world, making it a lucrative market for companies making vaping products such as U.S.-based Juul, as well as Philip Morris which manufactures a heat-not-burn tobacco device.    While announcing the ban, Sitharaman showed various types of products to the media, including a Juul vaping device that resembles a USB flash drive.  Juul had plans to launch its e-cigarette in India and has hired several senior executives in recent months. Philip Morris also has plans to launch its heat-not-burn smoking device in India, Reuters has reported.  Juul and other vaping companies have come under increased scrutiny in the U.S. amid multiple lawsuits, several deaths and possibly hundreds of illnesses tied to e-cigarettes, which are used to inhale nicotine vapour without smoking.  A spokeswoman for Juul in India declined to comment. Philip Morris did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Vaping advocates denounce ban  The ban order needs to be approved by the president before it takes effect, but this is typically a formality.  Advocates for e-cigarettes say vaping is far less harmful than smoking tobacco. But many tobacco-control activists are opposed to the devices, saying they could lead to nicotine addiction and push people toward consuming tobacco.  More than 900,000 people die each year in India due to tobacco-related illnesses.    The Association of Vapers India, an organization that represents e-cigarette users across the country, attacked the government's decision, saying it would deprive millions of smokers of a safer solution to cut back on smoking.  Shares in ITC, India's top cigarette maker, ended up nearly one per cent, while its rival Godfrey Phillips surged 5.2 per cent. E-cigarettes form just a tiny part of their product range.  The ban order will impose a jail term of up to one year and a fine of 100,000 rupees ($1,863 Cdn) for first-time offenders. A repeat violation would attract a jail term of up to three years and a penalty of up to 500,000 rupees ($9,315 Cdn), the government said.    The ban would apply to the manufacture, import, sale, advertisement and distribution of e-cigarettes.  Such executive orders are typically issued as an emergency measure when Indian parliament is not in session. The ban order could lapse if it is not approved when lawmakers convene against in the next session of parliament, which will most likely be held in November.  Democrats threaten to subpoena Juul  Meanwhile in Washington, Democrats threatened Wednesday to subpoena Juul Labs if the it does not provide documents relating to its products and marketing practices, as a House panel looks into whether the company deliberately targeted children.  In June, Raja Krishnamoorthi, chairman of the House Oversight Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy, asked for documents relating to information, including Juul's relationship with schools, and the tobacco giant Altria Group Inc's purchase of a portion of the firm. He said in a statement on Wednesday Juul had not complied with the request.    The House subcommittee ordered Juul, which is privately held, to produce the documents by Oct. 1, or ""we may have no choice but to seek compulsory process,"" Krishnamoorthi wrote in a letter to the company on Tuesday.  Juul faces about 30 lawsuits, with more expected, alleging it illegally marketed products to children, failed to issue warnings to consumers about their dangers and defectively designed products.  The company has yanked some flavour pods from retail shelves and changed its advertising to feature older models, but has continued to sell menthol and mint flavours.  U.S. health regulators have signaled plans to stop the sale of all flavoured e-cigarettes.",health
17,"Forget the treadmill: An intense game of chess can burn hundreds of calories, research suggests","Read Story Transcript  When it comes to losing weight, a couple of intense hours devising the perfect checkmate could be just as effective as pounding a treadmill, according to some research.  In 2018, several competitors at the Isle of Man International chess competition had their heart rates measured while they played.   After a two-hour game, grandmaster Mikhail Antipovhad burned 560 calories — the equivalent of more than a five-mile run.    That calorific burn comes from the stress of the game — increased heart anbd breathing rates, as well as elevated blood pressure — all of which can add up to weight loss.  The 1984 World Chess Championship was called off after five months with both competitors — Anatoly Karpov and Garry Kasparov — experiencing exhaustion. Karpov was reported to have lost close to 20 lbs.  A recent ESPN article quoted Professor Robert Sapolsky, who in a 2009 speech at Stanford University said that a high-level chess player can burn up to 6,000 calories a day while playing in a tournament.  More recent research has since suggested the figure could be closer to 132 calories per hour, which would equate to 1,188 calories over a nine-hour game.    Maurice Ashley is a chess grandmaster and commentator who says that these days, the best chess players train on both chess boards and treadmills.  He spoke to The Current's interim host Laura Lynch about why the game needs both brains and brawn. Here is part of their conversation.  What were your thoughts when you heard players can burn hundreds of calories just from two hours of playing chess?  It's a reminder of what our sport is about at the highest levels, because it is intense. It is stressful. It's always razor's edge — every move could be a mistake. And that kind of pressure does lead to a lot of stress and subsequently a lot of calories burned.    The physical strain apparently is so great that players often drop weight during tournaments. What was the most extreme case of that?   Well, probably the worst case was Anatoly Karpov, when he played his world champion match against Garry Kasparov back in the mid-80s. They played a really long match — it was called ""the unlimited match"" because instead of having a set number of games, it was the first person to win six games. And they couldn't get the six wins, they were so tightly matched.  And by the end Anatoly Karpov literally looked like death. I mean the guy's skin was just like hanging off his bones, it was so bad. They stopped the match and decided to play a new match that had a limited number of games. That kind of extreme example is bad because that match actually lasted months. But you could see quite a bit of that happening with players.    Have there been other instances of severe weight loss?  Not clearly … as certain as that one. I think today's players are much more cognizant of the fact that you have to stay in shape, you have to exercise, be ready for the rigours of that kind of tournament intensity. Today's players are much more keen on it. They'll focus on their diet, proper eating, proper exercise and I think that they're more steeled for competition than ever.  How have chess regulations changed to address this fact of extreme weight loss?  It has not. I don't think that problem exists with players today. The players are just much fitter; they workout on treadmills before, sometimes after games. Often after games in fact, just to get rid of whatever pent-up stress they had coming from the game, and wind down.    You're a grandmaster. Have you ever experienced that type of weight fluctuation?  No, I've always been pretty fit, pretty much aware of the kind of diet I eat, and really focusing on being healthy.   You burn calories, but as long as you keep that voracious appetite up then you can always just get it back. So it's really about staying alert to the possible dangers of all that stress and potential weight loss and then just managing it.    Maybe you can give me a bit of insight here because when I see really good chess players playing, they look so stoic. And I would think that what they're really doing is just trying to slow things down, including their heart rate, to be able to focus on what's at hand. What's actually going on beneath the visage?   My friends would look at me and say: ""When we're watching you play ... we don't know if you're winning, you're losing, it's equal."" They never know, but that's because my face, it has that resting angry face, you know, like I'm just trying to kill the guy.   But inside? The heart rate's up. You think you're doing well and all of a sudden you realize you made a small mistake, and it's like ""Oh man, this is gonna turn around,"" and you're trying to, as you said, slow things down and manage the emotional boiling that's happening inside.     I suppose that the physical fitness would help you not be drenched in sweat when you're facing the board?   You're going to sweat anyway — you're not going to be drenched in sweat though, but I mean it is that kind of thing. Imagine if you were to take a college finals.  You study like crazy the night before. Then you go to the finals and you have to take that test. Imagine thinking back-to-back finals on the same day, because chess games can last five, six hours. And imagine that the finals is actually fighting back! It's changing as you're trying to get the right answer.  Well that's what you're doing when you're facing an opponent. Your best ideas you're putting down, and the opponent's like: ""Nope, I've got a better idea,"" and they're hitting back. And then imagine doing that nine days in a row. That is the kind of intensity that chess competition is about, and you have to be ready for those rigours.    Written by Padraig Moran. Produced by Samira Mohyeddin.",technology
18,Statistics Canada reports manufacturing sales fell 1.3% in July,"Statistics Canada says manufacturing sales fell 1.3 per cent to $57.2 billion in July as sales in the primary metal and motor vehicle industries moved lower.  The agency says sales were down in 11 industries in July, representing 66.8 per cent of total manufacturing sales.  Economists had expected a decline of 0.2 per cent, according to financial markets data firm Refinitiv.  Statistics Canada says primary metal industry sales fell 7.3 per cent in July as every primary metal industry except alumina and aluminum production and processing reported lower sales.  Motor vehicle industry sales dropped 4.7 per cent due in part to an extended shutdown at a major assembly plant for maintenance projects to support new model production.  Manufacturing sales in constant dollars were down 1.6 per cent in July, indicating that a lower volume of products was sold.",business
19,Singh says he'll meet Trudeau to accept apology only if it's in private and politics-free,"NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said today he'd be happy to meet with Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau to discuss racism in the wake of the prime minister's blackface revelations — provided the meeting happens in private and is not used for political purposes.  ""His office reached out and I have indicated that I am open to having a conversation, as long as it remains private and I am not in any way used as a way for the Liberal Party to redeem the situation,"" Singh told CBC Radio's The House in an interview airing Saturday. ""That is for Canadians to make the decision.""  Trudeau has been in damage control mode since Wednesday evening, when pictures of him in blackface were published by an American magazine.  Time Magazine first reported that Trudeau had darkened his skin with makeup and dressed in a turban with long flowing robes when he attended an Arabian Nights-themed gala in 2001 at West Point Grey Academy, a private school in Vancouver, B.C., where he used to work.    Trudeau held an emergency press conference on his campaign plane Wednesday evening. He apologized for his behaviour and admitted to another blackface incident while he was a student at at Le collège Jean-de-Brébeuf in Montreal.  On Thursday, a third instance of Trudeau wearing blackface came to light when a video surfaced showing him with his face, arms and legs painted black while wearing an afro wig.  Trudeau shed more light on that third incident earlier today. ""It was a costume day for river guides in the white water rafting operation that I worked at in the summer between 1992 and 1994, roughly,"" he said in Toronto.  Apologizing to Singh personally  Singh said that Trudeau's efforts to rebuild his image should start with Canadians.  ""There are a lot of people right now who are seeing the prime minister of this country mocking their reality, mocking their lived experience, and it's going to bring up a lot of pain for a lot of folks that's going to remind them of the insults they've heard their whole life,"" Singh told host Chris Hall.  ""It's going to remind them of the physical violence they may have suffered, the barriers, and it's really those Canadians that need to be at the heart of anything that happens.""  Trudeau said that he is onside with Singh in the NDP leader's efforts to combat Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, racism and intolerance and is looking forward to speaking with him personally.  ""I will be apologizing to him personally as a racialized Canadian, as I have been apologizing to Canadians who have suffered discrimination and intolerance their entire lives in ways that some of us, like me, have never had to experience on a daily basis,"" Trudeau said.",politics
20,Soaring rents and house prices in Canadian cities make housing a key election issue,"Jeff Gallant lived in his new home just 17 days before the For Sale sign went up.  Soon after the single dad rented the house, it was sold and the new owners sent him notice of a major renovation that would force Gallant and his two young children to leave. A similar thing occurred at his previous place, and it's happening to so many renters in Charlottetown that a new term has been born: Renoviction.  Charlottetown is a prime example of the scarce vacancies and spiraling costs facing renters in communities across the country.  ""It's getting ridiculous,"" Gallant says of the rental market. ""Prices have doubled pretty much, and that boils back to supply and demand. They know there's nothing here, [so landlords] jack up the price.""  Cost of living is a big election issue, a CBC News-commissioned online poll from June suggests, and housing is the biggest single expense for most Canadians, according to Statistics Canada figures on annual household spending.  As the campaign has unfolded, the federal parties have begun to unveil plans on how they'd make life more affordable for voters.  The Liberals aim to build 100,000 affordable housing units over a decade. They would also encourage home ownership through a first-time home-buyer incentive that subsidizes up to 10 per cent of the purchase of a new home and five per cent on resale homes — with restrictions.     The NDP have a more ambitious plan, committing to build 500,000 affordable housing units in a decade.  A central message of the Conservative campaign is that it wants people ""to get ahead, not just get by,"" and that the government needs to get its hand out of Canadians' pockets in areas like the carbon tax, which the party describes as ineffective. The Conservatives have promised to ease building regulations to increase the housing supply, and said Monday that if elected the party would change the maximum mortgage term, increasing it from 25 years to allow up to 30-year mortgages. It is also promising to review the ""stress test"" for first-time buyers applying for a mortgage.    Housing costs  The reality is that finding affordable housing is increasingly difficult in many parts of Canada.  The smallest provincial capital, Charlottetown, has one of the lowest rental vacancy rates in the country. It hovers just above zero per cent, new Kijiji listings last just minutes before apartments are snapped up, and renters complain about spending ever more of their limited dollars on housing.  It is an old axiom of financial planners that renters should never spend more than 30 per cent of their gross earnings on rent and utilities. In Charlottetown, low income renters (those earning less than $21,361) spend on average 62 per cent of their earnings on housing.  The numbers get only marginally better when income levels increase.    Data gathered by the Canadian Rental Housing Index shows that Toronto renters earning as much as $45,498 a year are dedicating 40 per cent of their earnings to monthly housing costs. Live outside the downtown core, in York or Peel region, and those middle income earners are paying an average of per cent 44 and 38 per cent respectively.   In Regina, low-income renters spend more than half their pre-tax earnings on rent and utilities. In Calgary it's 62 per cent, and 91 per cent in Vancouver.  This may help to explain why so many adult children are returning to live with their parents even after they've entered the workforce, or why many young adults choose to have roommates to defray living costs.      Check out your region's costs and compare it to others on the Rental Housing Index     Growing population  Across Canada, it's not simply a question of how much accommodation costs, but also about keeping up with the need for more places to live.  In 2018, there were 37,000 new apartments built nationwide, but demand increased by 50,000 units, according to tracking done by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.    And Canadian cities continue to grow, driven by factors such as immigration and stronger job numbers.  With housing-related problems rising and the cost of living a primary issue for Canadian voters, Charlottetown Mayor Philip Brown figures political party leaders in the midst of a federal election campaign should be talking more about it. When he was elected last year, he describes how he used a congratulatory phone call from the Prime Minister to drive home his top priority.  ""We have a problem with affordable and accessible housing,"" Brown says he told Justin Trudeau on a call shortly after his election as mayor in November 2018. ""We need more public spending from the provincial and federal governments to up the supply of affordable and accessible housing.""    Each community has its own housing challenges, and one of the big ones for Charlottetown is that short-term rentals for the city's giant tourism industry suck up a lot of housing stock.   Another is house prices — Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) data shows they've jumped 38.5 per cent in the past three years alone in P.E.I.'s capital. By comparison, prices rose 25.3 per cent in Toronto, 21.6 in Ottawa and 33.3 in Victoria. A market where buyers get into bidding wars is new for Canada's smallest province, which recently surpassed 153,000 residents, and it's persuading some landlords to sell.  Added to that, the province's population is growing, with people moving to P.E.I. from other nations and parts of Canada on both a permanent and temporary basis. The University of P.E.I. hasn't built a new residence in 14 years, for example, while its student population has increased by about a third. There have been significant increases in the number of students on campus requiring housing, with half now coming from out of province or out of country.  ""And that, in turn, is pushing more demand on downtown housing,"" Brown explains.  Holland College student Sierra Elkerton was debating whether she could even afford to stay in school after she was evicted by her landlord because the building was not up to code. She managed to find a new apartment, but for nearly double the monthly rent.  ""Realistically I don't want to pay that, but it looks like I'm going to have to,"" says Elkerton. ""The cost of living is way too high considering it's such a small city.""    She's not alone. A global survey by money manager BlackRock Inc. found ""many Canadians feel that they are in a financial squeeze — hard pressed to save amid what they perceive as a high cost of living, including devoting much of their income to paying for their homes.""  Canadians who responded to the poll said they spend an average of 43 per cent of their income on housing — whether renting or owning.   Among the 20 countries surveyed, only the Netherlands and Sweden had higher housing costs, at 51 per cent and 45 per cent respectively.    Charlottetown's mayor is well aware of the numbers. In his community, he's most focused on trying to help the people who find themselves paying more than they can afford — and those who can't find anything at all.  ""We may be a small city,"" he says, ""but we've got big city problems.""  The mayor says he would like to hear commitments from party leaders this election cycle to use the big federal wallet to help cities build more affordable housing.  ""I got two calls this past week and one visit to the office,"" Brown says. ""From a woman who was living in her car in the Walmart parking lot, and another woman that's been in [a shelter] now for almost a month and she needs a place to live.""",business
21,"For first time in history of Canada's National Ballet School, more boys than girls will graduate","Benjamin Alexander performs routine barre exercises in his afternoon class in a large bright studio within Canada's National Ballet School (NBS).  The set syllabus is taught by a male instructor, and Alexander, 16, is also surrounded by nine other boys — something that's now completely normal.  In Alexander's Grade 12 class, there are 16 boys and 11 girls, marking the first time in the institution's illustrious 60-year history that female ballet dancers are outnumbered.  The ratio surprises even Alexander, who said he used to feel like he was keeping a secret as a dancer growing up in Chatham-Kent, Ont.     ""At school, everyone was going to hockey practice and baseball practice, and I was there with my dance shoes and dance bag going off to dance class. It was hard,"" he told CBC Toronto.  ""Definitely, there was a feeling of solitude.""    Alexander says he was first inspired to dance by his older sister, and initially took up tap dancing. But then a Christmas performance role at his local dance studio caught his attention.  ""I wanted nothing more than to be a baby reindeer so I said, 'I'm going to start ballet classes,' and I never looked back since.""  The senior student is part of the school's professional ballet program, which requires students to audition. He says he's a lot more confident now, especially being surrounded by so many like-minded students in his program.  ""I look around at my class and see this group of amazing men who are all following this dream to become ballet dancers, and it's inspired me to work harder and even more passionately toward my dream.""  He says while there are still some stigmas that linger for male ballet dancers in 2019, he's seen some changes in his time at the school.     ""People don't generally understand how much passion, perseverance and determination it takes to become a male ballet dancer,"" he said.  ""I think that's shifted now. I think people realize we work extremely hard to become the top of our field.""  After he graduates, Alexander hopes to join a professional dance company, and has his eye on the Dutch National Ballet Academy of Amsterdam. But really he says he just hopes to keep doing what he loves ""and getting applause for it.""  Many of his sentiments are echoed by his 17-year-old classmate Andrew Larose, originally from London, Ont.    Larose was intrigued by dance after seeing Michael Jackson perform, but also amazed by Russian ballet dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov's grace and strength.  ""Even at a young age — 12 years old  — I knew that this was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life for as long as possible,"" Larose said.  The teen recalls growing up and being the only boy in his class and coming to the NBS and entering ""a whole new world.""  ""It's a dream come true seeing 16 boys and 11 girls in my graduating class. It's amazing.""  He says he's excited to see what the future holds for men in ballet.  ""It's great that now more people are opening up to this and realizing men dance.""  'Change takes time'  Mavis Staines has filled the role of artistic director and CEO of Canada's National Ballet School for the last three decades and has been witnessing this milestone class grow together for the last six years.  ""The ratio of men to women and making sure that there are as many male dancers as female dancers who have a chance to pursue their dream has been a passion of mine and my colleagues for a long time,"" Staines says.  The CEO explains that the school has been implementing community programs, including partnering with public schools, in order to expose kids to dance at a young age.    There was talk at one point of offering the classes to boys for free to encourage enrolment.  ""But as a woman, I couldn't stand the idea of offering classes to boys for free, and that young women didn't have the same opportunity. I thought that's not how I'm going to do it.""  While she says she believes that their community programs did help even out the numbers, there's also been an authentic shift in people's perceptions about ballet through shows and social media.    She also credits the popularity of the film and musical Billy Elliot, the story of an 11-year-old ballet dancer, as another push toward acceptance.  ""I think for a long time in North America, especially in Canada, parents, especially fathers, couldn't imagine their sons dancing,"" she said.  ""Genuine systemic change takes time.""  Staines said it's ""deeply exciting"" that the graduating class starting this month aligns with the school's 60th anniversary.   Proud teacher   Raymond Smith is a teacher at Canada's National Ballet School and is currently teaching the boys class of 2020.  ""It's so inspiring to work with these young men because they're passionate about ballet, and they want to learn, and they want to get ahead and they want to dance professionally,"" he said.  Smith danced at the school in the 70's and spent 20 years with the National Ballet of Canada, 15 of those years as a principal dancer.  ""I think it's more acceptable now,"" he said.  ""I think in my day I was lucky I wasn't teased because I played sports with the same people who would've teased me.""    Smith says in the future, he'd love to eventually see a ballet performance choreographed for a group of male dancers. He has taught this group for two years and is an awe of how much stronger they've become.   ""They're more dynamic, more artistic. They're not afraid to show who they are.""  For Alexander, he hopes that boys breaking ballet stereotypes continues to inspire new talent and end negative perceptions.      I just hope that little boys are no longer afraid — that they no longer have this predetermined thought that ballet is not for them.  - Benjamin Alexander, dance student     ""I just hope that little boys are no longer afraid — that they no longer have this predetermined thought that ballet is not for them,"" he said.  ""I hope if any boy wants to move and dance, they are free and able to do that.""  [PHOTOGALLERY]",entertainment
22,Older Canadians reinvent themselves as 'seniorpreneurs' — in hopes it'll pay off,"'Seniorpreneurs' are part of a quickly growing group of older Canadians who are choosing to work beyond the traditional retirement age of 65 — some as a financial necessity, others because they simply aren't ready to call it quits.  A pilot program specifically designed for senior entrepreneurs in Oshawa, Ont., tested the waters to see whether Canadian baby boomers not only want to keep working but also desire to be their own bosses.  The answer, according to program creator Pramilla Ramdahani, is a resounding yes.  ""How do we finance this new and growing sector, with so many talented ideas that bring a lifetime of skills to the table?"" said Ramdahani.  Ramdahani launched the Seniorpreneur Program 4 Innovation, Creativity, and Entrepreneurship, or SPICE, and received 75 applications for the 60 positions it offered in its first cohort in 2018-19.    Ramdahani says ageism was a big factor in creating a seniors-specific program. She says nearly all of the pilot participants identified ageism in the workplace or in applying for jobs as part of their reasoning for looking for something else.  ""Hence, they really want to create their own [jobs],"" said Ramdahani.  According to Statistics Canada, nearly 15 per cent of Canadians 65 years and older are still in the workforce, compared to around 6 per cent 20 years ago — and their entrepreneurial spirits are strong.    Nearly half of small business owners are baby boomers, according to a new online poll by Ipsos commissioned by RBC, conducted between June 21 and June 24, 2019. That's almost twice the rate of business ownership than there is among millennials.  For some Canadians, retiring at age 65 isn't a reality, simply because of a lack of pension or savings. A 2018 survey by Sun Life Financial even found that a quarter of retired Canadians are still in debt in their golden years.  Canadians saving less  Some future retirees may continue to be short on savings, as Statistics Canada data shows that the household savings rate has fallen from a high of 21.6 per cent of net disposable income in 1982, to 1.7 per cent in the second quarter of 2019.  Lower interest rates could be one of the reasons for saving less, according to BMO Capital Markets economist Robert Kavcic, because the returns on savings are smaller and borrowing at low rates is tempting.  ""I think everybody that's investing now for retirement needs to be ratcheting down their return expectations and what a balanced portfolio is going to give you going forward over the next 10, 15, or 20 years"" said Kavcic.      Why Canadians find saving so hard — and how to get better at it   Even in an 'affordable' Canadian city, cost-of-living squeeze has people putting pressure on politicians    Bill VanGorder, who's 76, knew he would need to rely on his savings for retirement, as he worked for charities and not-for-profits throughout his life and didn't have a guaranteed pension. However, he says the 2008 financial crisis wiped out about half of his savings.  ""It's never really recovered for those of us who were invested at that time,"" said VanGorder.  Fortunately, VanGorder is able to supplement his savings with a company he started to sell and distribute Nordic walking poles in Atlantic Canada, as well as teach lessons.   ""The extra income is not only helpful but necessary,"" said VanGorder, owner of Nordic Walking Nova Scotia.    VanGorder also enjoys the challenges involved with learning new skills, such as online marketing and sales.  ""If you had told me 20 years ago that somebody of my age would be running an online business and doing so much social networking sales as we do, well, I wouldn't have known what you were talking about actually,"" laughed VanGorder.  Staying active and relevant is why 65-year-old Tom Gibson took part in Ramdahani's entrepreneur program for seniors in Oshawa.   Gibson wanted help as he and his two sons developed a business to sell portable safes.  Their HavlarGo safes would provide athletes, parents, and others on the go with a way to secure their valuables if they need to leave them unattended. For example, a baseball player could put their phone and wallet in the small safe, and use the tether to secure it to the bench or dugout while they play.    ""I always had that kind of entrepreneurial flair, but I never really had the opportunity. I could see that my sons had it in them as well, and I thought it was a flame that should be nurtured — let's not ignore this,"" said Gibson, while at the studio of Toronto firm West&amp;SOCIAL, the production company creating a product video for Havlar's upcoming crowdfunding campaign.  Gibson has no plans to retire anytime soon, even though he has a small pension from previous jobs. He is also still working full-time as a business consultant, which helps him contribute to funding the new family business.  ""It's about staying engaged. It's about being creative. It's about working with family and friends to do something that hasn't been done before,"" said Gibson.  Funding gap for senior entrepreneurs  Through the first round of the seniors' entrepreneur program, Ramdahani found a massive hole in terms of funding to support the senior entrepreneurs, including limited grants and loans for their businesses.   ""There is zero support,"" said Ramdahani.  She wants the next federal government to prioritize funding for seniors' entrepreneurial endeavours, and she hopes to secure other private funding as well to help her expand the SPICE program from 60 participants to 1,000 over three years.  ""They have been sitting on these ideas for about 30 to 40 years, so now is the time for them to unleash,"" said Ramdahani.",business

24,Liberal Party confirms 3rd instance of Trudeau wearing blackface,"The Liberal Party has confirmed Justin Trudeau appeared in a short amateur video in blackface — a third instance of Trudeau appearing in racist makeup in the past — less than 12 hours after he admitted to wearing such makeup on just two occasions and acknowledged the actions were ""racist.""  The confirmation comes after Time Magazine dropped a bombshell story on Wednesday night featuring a 2001 photo of Trudeau in brownface and a turban, taken at a gala at a private school where Trudeau taught 18 years ago.    When asked about the incident Wednesday night, Trudeau also admitted to a second instance of racist behaviour. ""When I was in high school I dressed up at a talent show and sang Day-O with makeup on,"" he said.  This morning, the party confirmed a third instance of Trudeau being filmed in racist makeup, as first reported by Global News.    It's not clear where the video was taken. It appears to show Trudeau with his face and arms covered in black makeup, raising his hands in the air while laughing and sticking out his tongue.  ""We can confirm that it is him and it's from the early 1990s,"" said a Liberal Party spokesperson in a statement.    Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer later confirmed the video had been sent to his team originally, which then passed it on to Global for ""verification.""  A Liberal source says Trudeau held a conference call with his candidates Thursday morning to apologize. He will address the media at 2:15 p.m. ET in Winnipeg before flying to Saskatoon.  The photos have disrupted the Liberals' campaign plans. Until now, Trudeau has had morning events on every day of the federal election campaign.  For the first time during the campaign, Trudeau and his team stayed at a different hotel than members of the media Wednesday night.  Speaking to reporters on his campaign plane Wednesday night in Nova Scotia, Trudeau apologized for his actions, saying he now recognizes they were racist.  ""I shouldn't have done that. I should have known better, but I didn't and I'm really sorry,"" he said. ""I take responsibility for my decision to do that. I shouldn't have done it. I should have known better.  ""It was something that I didn't think was racist at the time, but now I recognize it was something racist to do and I am deeply sorry.""  Trudeau's apology based on 'a lie': Scheer  The story dominated the other leaders' campaign events today.   Scheer said the emergence of the video shows Trudeau's Wednesday night apology was based on ""a lie.""  ""I believe Canadians might have been able to accept his apology if he had been truthful and open, if he hadn't based that apology on a lie,"" Scheer said during a stop in Saint-Hyacinthe, Que.    ""He was specifically asked if there were other instances where he engaged in that type of racist behaviour and he indicated there was only one other instance. Now we know there [were] at least three.""  Asked today if he's ever dressed in any way that would be deemed offensive, Scheer said he has not.  ""I'm not perfect and I don't claim to be a saint, but nothing would come up to that level,"" he said.  During an interview with John Moore, host of Newstalk 1010 in Toronto, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh was asked if he'll smile and shake Trudeau's hand at the first leaders' debate.  ""It's going to be tough,"" he said. ""To be honest with you, I don't really know how to react. This is someone who so casually mocked the reality for so many people and has hurt a lot of Canadians with this.""

25,"Writer and conservationist Graeme Gibson, partner of Margaret Atwood, dead at 85","Graeme Gibson, the Canadian author, conservationist and longtime champion of writers' rights, has died at age 85.  Margaret Atwood, Gibson's longtime partner, said in a statement Wednesday issued by publisher Penguin Random House Canada: ""We are devastated by the loss of Graeme, our beloved father, grandfather and spouse, but we are happy that he achieved the kind of swift exit he wanted and avoided the decline into further dementia that he feared.  ""He had a lovely last few weeks, and he went out on a high, surrounded by love, friendship and appreciation. We are grateful for his wise, ethical and committed life.""  Gibson died Wednesday in London, England, where he had accompanied Atwood for the global release of her latest book.  Earlier this week, Atwood cancelled promotional appearances in Ottawa and Montreal for The Testaments — a sequel to her dystopian classic The Handmaid's Tale and one of this fall's most anticipated literary releases. The cancellation cited illness in the family.   A cover story in Time magazine earlier this month noted that Gibson was ""living with dementia,"" and that Atwood juggled caring for him while working on her new novel. In a 2017 piece in The Walrus about the couple's love of birdwatching, Gibson confirmed he had been diagnosed with dementia.    Born in London, Ont., in August 1934, Gibson penned novels (Five Legs, Communion, Perpetual Motion and Gentleman Death) as well as non-fiction, including Eleven Canadian Novelists (for which he interviewed his future partner Atwood), The Bedside Book of Birds and The Bedside Book of Beasts.    ""We are deeply saddened by the death of such a beloved and distinguished author. Graeme was a friend to several generations of Canadian writers,"" Penguin Random House Canada CEO Kristin Cochrane said in a statement.  She hailed Gibson as ""a true gentleman, whose gracious, elegant and witty manner touched all who knew him.""    He was also an activist for different causes.  Gibson was a founding member of both the Writers' Union of Canada and the Writers' Trust of Canada, as well as a past president of PEN Canada. He was an advocate for conservation efforts and a devoted birder who helped found the Pelee Island Bird Observatory.  Gibson was invested as a member of the Order of Canada in 1992.  Along with Atwood, he's survived by, among others, their daughter Eleanor Jess, sons Matt and Grae from his previous marriage to publisher Shirley Gibson, and grandchildren.",entertainment
26,Yada yada yada: Netflix to air Seinfeld starting in 2021,"Netflix says it will start streaming all 180 episodes of Seinfeld in 2021, gaining a hugely popular addition to its library as the battle for viewers heats up.  Netflix Inc. struck the deal with Sony Pictures Television for the global streaming rights to the Emmy-winning television comedy, which aired its final episode in 1998.    Terms were not released.  Netflix is also the home of Jerry Seinfeld's talk series Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee.    The deal for Seinfeld comes after Netflix announced in June that it would be losing its most popular TV show, The Office.   Netflix will still carry the show for more than a year, but NBC isn't extending the licence further with NBCUniversal's streaming service launching in 2020.    Netflix will face even more competition in November, when Apple and Disney launch their own streaming services within days of each other.",entertainment
27,N.S. bird watchers shocked by 'staggering' bird declines,"Bird watchers in Nova Scotia say they are shocked but not entirely surprised by the findings in a recent report that estimates there are nearly three billion fewer birds in Canada and the United States than there were half a century ago.  The report published Thursday in the journal Science counted a loss of 2.9 billion birds compared with 1970, which represents a population decline of 29 per cent and an ""overlooked biodiversity crisis.""  ""This has been something that has been talked about for many years,"" said Lucas Berrigan, who works for Bird Studies Canada.  ""We've been sort of peripherally aware of it, [it's] just never been summarized in this way before.""  The study was co-authored by Environment Canada and Climate Change Canada, along with five United States agencies. It combined population data from more than 500 species going back half a century.    Its findings reflect what's happening in the Maritimes, said Berrigan.  ""This is not just North America,"" he said. ""There is a global crisis and I think we need to... take this more seriously than we have previously.""    While Bird Studies Canada does not have the same kind of statistics, it is monitoring certain populations, such as aerial insectivores and seabirds like Leach's storm petrel.  ""Barn swallows, chimney swifts and nighthawks, as well as seabirds, storm petrels in particular, these are birds that are usually out of sight of most people, but they are of a significant importance ecologically,"" Berrigan said.  ""We've seen quite large declines in those populations. The largest population of one of these seabirds has declined nearly 50 per cent in the past 35 years.""  Others impacted include backyard birds, warblers, finches, sparrows and songbirds, as well as long distance birds like swallows and sandpipers that come to Canada from the Arctic.  Berrigan noted that another recently published paper spoke about how neonicotinoid — a pesticide — is affecting bird migration.  ""In short, they lose a significant amount of body fat when feeding on seeds treated with very small amounts of [neonicotinoids],"" he said.  ""Body fat is extremely important for migratory birds since it determines how far they can fly at a given time.""    Andrew Holland, a spokesperson for the Nature Conservancy of Canada, said birds are important for many reasons and everyone should care about their decline.  ""It's staggering really,"" Holland said of the study's findings.    ""When you look at those numbers, clearly it's a signal that there needs to be more conservation of lands that protect the habitats for the birds that are remaining so that they have a fighting chance of bouncing back.""  Habitat loss and climate change are among the major factors impacting the decline of bird populations.    Free-roaming domestic cats, collisions with glass, pesticide use and a decline in insects are also factors, he said.  Holland suggested that people leave their cats indoors.  ""A lot of lands have been lost — wetlands, forests, coastal shoreline areas have been lost to erosion, storm surges, development and subdivisions,"" said Holland.  ""So what's happened is these birds have been displaced and they've lost their traditional habitat and they've had difficulty relocating.""",technology
28,Why tech giants are creating apps for people with disabilities,"Tech companies like Google are stepping up efforts to create products for people living with disabilities as a way to make them more accessible and to boost business.   Part of that effort is developing apps designed to facilitate communication between hearing and non-hearing people.   ""We have technology and capabilities, particularly in the realm of machine learning and AI that we can apply,"" said Brian Kemler, product manager of accessibility for Google.   In February, Google rolled out Live Transcribe, an app that does literally that—transcribing speech in almost real-time while detecting ambient sound like vehicles and specific types of music. It can also transcribe dozens of languages.   Noisy environments  ""It's really convenient,"" said Anya Karir, a Toronto woman who is deaf. Karir has a cochlear implant, so she doesn't use the app every day. She said it helps her in noisy environments, like on a recent trip to New York where she was on a tour and couldn't hear what the guide was saying.   ""I pulled out the phone, connected to the WiFi and I was able to read what he was saying,"" she said.   She also said it's useful in everyday situations, like coffee shops where there is often noise from the machines as well as other conversations happening around her.     Tech giants getting into the business of making their products and services more accessible is a plus for Derek Rumball, president of the Bob Rumball Canadian Centre of Excellence for the Deaf.   ""Everyone is always inventing a new mouse trap,"" he said. ""Anytime technology helps me understand a deaf person and, more importantly, helps them be understood, helps level the playing field.""   Good for business  Levelling that playing field isn't just the socially responsible thing to do, argues tech expert Takara Small, who founded a not-for-profit helping kids from underserved communities learn about coding and entrepreneurship.   Small said there are dozens of apps out there, developed by startups and big tech companies that do everything from amplifying sound to mapping out which buildings are wheelchair accessible.   She's especially noticing tech companies like Facebook and Microsoft taking a leadership role in the field.   ""It's just the right thing to do to make products anyone, anywhere can use,"" she said.   But the approach also benefits the bottom line. In April, the World Bank estimated a billion people, or 15 per cent of the world's population, experience some form of disability.   ""Technology is so crucial to everything we do so creating products that allow everyone to participate is a financially smart move,"" she said.",health
29,"Leaders talk financial relief, but Trudeau still quizzed over blackface scandal","Days after the blackface scandal rocked the election campaign, the federal party leaders on Sunday appeared to be looking to move on, rolling out policies they said would put more money in people's pockets.  But Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau, despite two major policy announcements, was again peppered with questions from reporters about the controversial images.    Policies dealing with financial relief,  cost-of-living, or so-called ""pocketbook"" issues have been a common thread throughout the campaign. All leaders have talked about making life easier for families. And little wonder — a survey conducted by CBC News found that that issue was the greatest concern for Canadians heading into this election.  Plans to make life financially easier  Just this week, before the revelations of the brownface and blackface images became international news, the Conservatives, Liberals, NDP and Greens had brought forward proposals, which they claim, would make life financially easier for Canadians.  NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh promised free dental care for households making under $70,000. Trudeau promised a boost to the Canada Child Benefit (CCB) for babies, and a 15-week leave program for adoptive parents. Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said a Tory government would resurrect a policy of the former Conservative government — tax credits for expenses related to children fitness, sports activities and arts and learning.     Meanwhile, Green Party Elizabeth May, who unveiled her full party platform, promised a Green government would limit credit card interest rates and ATM fees.  And on Sunday, both Singh and Scheer were offering more financial help for some voters. In  Canoe Cove, P.E.I., Scheer focused on veterans, promising to help them financially by dealing with the backlog of veterans' benefits applications within two years. Meanwhile, Singh, in Gatineau, Que., promised to add $2.5 billion to the federal government's disaster mitigation fund, money he wants used to build infrastructure that would help protect homes and businesses from floods.  But it was Trudeau who came out on Sunday in Brampton, Ont. with policies hoping to appeal to a wide range of middle-class families — cuts to income taxes and cellphone bills.  Won't pay taxes on first $15,000  He said a Liberal government, if re-elected, would raise the basic personal income tax deduction to $15,000 from the present $12,069 for people earning less than $147,000. That means they would pay no income tax on that first $15,000.   This, he said, would save the average taxpayer $292 every year, while an average family would get $585.     While the NDP and Greens, have instead, focused on raising taxes on corporations, it's the Conservatives and Liberals who have been battling for title of best tax cuts.  Just a week ago, Scheer announced his own tax savings plan, which he said would cut the rate on the lowest income tax bracket to 13.75 per cent from 15 per cent.   Based on the party's calculations, the average single taxpayer would save about $444 a year. A two-income couple earning an average salary would save about $850 a year.    But Trudeau unveiled another pledge on Sunday, one that seemed to target the NDP.  He zoomed in on an expense Canadians love to complain about — cellphone bills. With Canadians reportedly paying some of the highest cellphone costs in the G7,  Trudeau announced that if re-elected, his government would cut those bills by 25 per cent over the next two years. That, he said, would save the average family of four up to $976 a year.  The Liberals' proposal took aim at the NDP's plan, which would implement price caps on cellphone and internet bills.  Questions about blackface scandal  Asked how exactly Trudeau, would cut those costs without regulation, the Liberal leader would only say that his government would ""engage"" with the telecom companies, and that they would face ""further competition"" if they were unable to achieve those price decreases.    But he was also questioned about the brownface and blackface scandal. Asked by a Reuters reporter just how short-lived the controversy may be, Trudeau suggested that Canadians are more concerned about affordability issues and two of the biggest are taxes and cell phone costs.  Yet he was still asked specific questions about the scandal: Could he say he hasn't worn blackface since 2001? Did he first realize blackface was racist in 2008? Was he reaching out to anybody who might help jog his memory regarding the number of times he has worn blackface?  But he seemed to take all those questions in stride, giving no specifics, instead, saying he has been forthright on this issue, that he will continue to stand against racism, that he was deeply embarrassed but takes responsibility for his actions.",politics
30,"Alberta's 'Gas City' to shut down 2,000 wells, laying off up to 100 people","The southern Alberta community of Medicine Hat — known as ""The Gas City"" — is permanently shuttering 2,000 of its active natural gas wells due to extremely low prices, resulting in layoffs for about 100 people.  The decision to close 75 per cent of the city's wells was announced last Wednesday and formalized Monday evening. Medicine Hat Mayor Ted Clugston said the difficult choice was a long time in the making.  ""This didn't happen overnight,"" Clugston said on the Calgary Eyeopener.  ""We've been actually talking about a strategy going forward for 10 years now since I've been on city council, when the prices basically went into the tank in 2008-2009.""  Clugston said that the continual plunge in natural gas prices has caused the city to lose money at the rate of $30-35 million a year.    ""There have been points in time that we're actually paying people to take our gas,"" said Clugston.  About 500 of the city's oldest wells, called ""100-year wells,"" in the city's north side will remain active, as they cost the least to keep running.     ""We will still have to keep some employees on to maintain those, but everything in Saskatchewan and to the east of us is going to be shut in eventually,"" said Clugston.  The closures will result in about 100 workers losing their jobs.  ""We've really never, ever laid anybody off … it's a tough thing to do,"" said Clugston.  ""It's not something we want to do. We'll try to accommodate as many as we can, but I think most of them realize that this day was coming.""  Identity crisis  Job and industry losses are a hard legacy to grapple with as a city and as mayor, said Clugston.  ""I didn't want to be the mayor in 120 years that took Medicine Hat somewhat out of the gas business. I mean, that's not a legacy that anybody would want to leave in this municipality,"" said Clugston.  Clugston said the people of Medicine Hat are generally supportive of the decisions he and the city council made.      The silver lining on cheap natural gas is that anybody who burns it to … value add is doing well.  - Ted Clugston, mayor of Medicine Hat     ""But my citizens … they're not happy about it but they recognize that tough business decisions have to be made.""  He said that despite these losses, Medicine Hat's identity will still be tied to the oil and gas industry.  ""We take great pride in our history of natural gas production as a municipality and everything that it's given to us all,"" said Clugston.  ""All of our recreation facilities are paid for, and our property taxes are subsidized by the natural gas profits, and all of our industry here burns natural gas to make fertilizer or fuel or methanol — now we're even using it to make bitcoin.""  Silver lining  After the wells close, Clugston said they plan on leaving them that way, ""unless a miracle happens,"" as re-drilling would be costly.  ""The goal is to cap them and take the equipment off and to reclaim the land to its original, whatever it was, if it was grass for cattle or whatever,"" said Clugston.  The closing of so many natural gas wells in a city nicknamed for its oil and gas history signals a shift in industry for the population of 60,000 people.  However, Clugston said natural gas still powers the city's future.    ""The silver lining on cheap natural gas is that anybody who burns it to … value add is doing well,"" said Clugston.   He cited Medicine Hat's methanol plant, the Goodyear tire plant, bitcoin mining ⁠— which uses electricity generated from natural gas ⁠— and the future Aurora Cannabis greenhouse.  ""That's all based on low-cost natural gas,"" said Clugston.  ""We're still very proud of that and we will keep The Gas City we are.""    With files from the Calgary Eyeopener.",business
31,Antigone chosen as Canada's Oscars contender for best international film,"Quebec writer-director Sophie Deraspe says she's proud that her film has been chosen as the ""Canadian ambassador"" in the lead-up to the 2020 Academy Awards.  Telefilm Canada announced Friday that Canada is putting forward Antigone to vie for a nomination in the Oscars' best international feature film category, previously known as best foreign language film.  Deraspe said she sees the recognition not only as an endorsement of her craft, but also of the ideal the film espouses.  ""Antigone is also a film about values — values of sympathy, integrity, love,"" the Montreal filmmaker said by phone after Friday's announcement.  ""I feel proud of ... campaigning not only for film, for the art of filmmaking, but also those values.""  A modern take on Sophocles' Greek tragedy, the drama, set in Montreal, centres on Antigone, played by newcomer Nahéma Ricci — a teenager caught in a clash between her moral code and Canada's justice system when tragedy strikes her immigrant family.  Deraspe, who wrote and directed the film, said the story represents the power of the individual to shatter the ""immovable wall"" of the system.  ""It's about a young woman who has no power in terms of what power is in our world ... and she stands against authority because of what she believes,"" said Deraspe, whose credits include the 2015 documentary The Amina Profile and the feature Les Loups.  ""That's what the film wants to carry — that OK, there's this big system above us, but we are those that are powerful deep inside.""  Antigone won the $30,000 Canada Goose Award for best Canadian feature film at the Toronto International Film Festival last Sunday.  Since then, Deraspe said she's been fielding calls from American film agents offering to help her break into Hollywood.  While she's interested in the opportunity to expand her cinematic reach, the 45-year-old said moving to Los Angeles wasn't really her ""dream.""  ""We live in a country that supports art and filmmaking ... that supports auteur filmmaking, not only commercial voices,"" she said.  ""We can bring out something to an audience that resonates more than just for fun or adventure, and in that way, yes, I'm proud of my country, and I'm proud of being the ambassador.""  Antigone, which hits theatres in Quebec on Nov. 6, is competing against films submitted by dozens of other countries, including two Canadian co-productions, in the race for an Oscars' nod for international feature.  A short list of 10 films will be unveiled on Dec. 16, and the chosen five official nominees will be announced on Jan.13.

33,Conservatives say they're ditching the traditional rally in favour of the door-knock,"Andrew Scheer's people say they're not troubled by the modest turnout of supporters at some of the Conservative leader's public campaign events. In fact, they say it's all part of the strategy.  While that might sound counterintuitive, a senior Conservative source said the campaign would rather see its volunteers out knocking on doors and handing out lawn signs instead of spending time and energy on organizing traditional rallies where supporters are used as a ""human backdrop.""  Scheer was asked about his crowd sizes on Tuesday during a news conference in Winnipeg, a day after an enthusiastic but small group of around 200 people showed up to watch Scheer's stump speech in Calgary.  Given the overwhelming support for the Conservative Party in Alberta, the deep sense of frustration there with Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau and the continued popularity of United Conservative Party Premier Jason Kenney, the crowd in Calgary seemed surprisingly small.  On day one of the campaign, about 500 people attended an evening rally for Scheer in the Greater Toronto Area riding of Woodbridge-Vaughan. About 350 people attended a Scheer rally at a community centre gym in Parksville, British Columbia on Vancouver Island on Sunday.  Trudeau is drawing much larger audiences so far. CBC News reporters covering the Liberal leader's tour say that on the first day of the campaign in Vancouver, around 1,300 attended a Trudeau rally there. On the third day, more than 1,200 people showed up for an event with Trudeau in Montreal.    ""We actually specifically tell people, 'You know, the best thing you can do to help form a Conservative government is hit those doors, get those brochures out,'"" Scheer said on Tuesday.  ""We specifically ask other campaigns to keep their volunteers on the ground knocking doors as much as possible ... I'm actually very pleased with the turnout.""  Ground game favoured  The Conservative source acknowledged the party's strategy is untested — and it won't know whether it worked until the votes are counted.  But the source expressed confidence that volunteer energy is better spent on the ground game than on rallies.  The source said the party is working to reshape its volunteer culture, and building up the ground game is a big part of that effort.  Scheer will do some rallies in larger Canadian cities closer to voting day. But these events are not expected to be the primary focus for the Conservative team.",politics

The Toronto beef slaughter and processing plant, which also does business as Tri-Pet Holdings Inc., was suspended as of September 17, 2019 for ""non-compliances related to control measures.""  ""Because this matter is under investigation, we do not have more information to share at this time,"" reads a statement to CBC News from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA).  ""The licence to operate was suspended because the operator failed to meet regulatory requirements as required (under) the Safe Food for Canadians Regulations. The company failed to implement effective control measures to ensure that activities conducted would result in a product that is safe for consumption.""  CFIA did not immediately provide more details but said there are currently no recalls associated with the licence suspension as CFIA conducts the food safety investigation.  If products are recalled, the public will be notified through CFIA's website.    Ryding-Regency did not respond to an email inquiry from CBC and the telephone number listed on its website is not in service.  According to its website, Ryding-Regency Meat Packers has been in operation since 1983 and is focused ""on producing the highest quality grain fed beef and veal products that Canada has to offer.""  ""Ryding-Regency is proud to be a family legacy spanning over two generations dedicated to master butchery,"" its website reads.  According to CFIA, the licence suspension will be lifted if the agency concludes that required corrective measures have been taken. If measures are not taken within 90 days after the suspension, CFIA can cancel the licence.  Concerns about kosher supply  Richard Rabkin is managing director of the Kashruth Council of Canada, the largest kosher certification agency in Canada.

Its current chief executive Mark Zekulin, who had previously been co-CEO alongside Linton, has said he would stay on until a suitable replacement was found.    Zekulin told shareholders at the meeting that it was his choice to leave, and it was a ""natural progression"" for new leadership to drive things forward.  Meanwhile, Linton on Tuesday announced his next moves, which include advisory roles in three companies including U.S.-based dispensary company Gage Cannabis Co. and Australia-based Mind Medicine Inc., which is focused on psychedelic-assisted medicines.",business
38,CDC activates emergency operations centre for vaping-related illnesses,"The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Monday it has activated its emergency operations centre to coordinate the investigation into hundreds of cases of severe lung illnesses linked to e-cigarette use.  The CDC's Emergency Operations Center offers a central command post where teams of trained disease experts track public health emergencies, share information and coordinate the responses.  ""CDC has made it a priority to find out what is causing this outbreak of e-cigarette or vaping-related injuries and deaths,"" CDC Director Robert Redfield said in a statement.  Recent emergencies in which the CDC activated the Emergency Operations Center include Hurricane Florence in 2018, hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria in 2017, and the Zika outbreak and the Flint, Michigan, water contamination crisis in 2016.  So far, the CDC has confirmed six deaths and is investigating 380 confirmed or probable cases of the vaping-related illness in 36 states and plus the U.S. Virgin Islands, the agency said last week.    While the cases have not yet been linked to a specific product or ingredient, health officials have urged consumers to quit vaping altogether.  For those who continue, the CDC urges consumers to avoid buying vaping products on the street, using marijuana-derived oil with the products or modifying a store-bought vape product.  Anyone who has breathing problems after vaping, such as a dry, or unproductive, cough; shortness of breath and chest pain that worsens with deep breathing, should report them to their doctor.",health
39,Filling 'prescriptions' for fruit and veggies blowing food bank's budget,"An Ottawa food bank that accepts ""prescriptions"" for fresh produce is struggling to keep up as more and more people come from across the city looking for fruit and vegetables.  About five years ago, the Parkdale Food Centre in Hintonburg began accepting clients from outside its catchment area, provided they have a written note for nutritious food from their doctor or social worker.   It's part of a growing ""social prescription"" movement to promote healthy eating, exercise and even social interaction.     Why doctors are prescribing bingo, not pills, to keep patients healthy   Why U.K. doctors are doling out 'social prescriptions' to treat mental health    Karen Secord, executive director of the Parkdale Food Centre, said since the food bank began accepting the prescriptions, she's seen its monthly food budget nearly double from $12,000 to $22,000.    ""Right now, about 55 per cent of the people who are coming here are coming here with prescriptions for healthy food,"" Secord said.  ""They're coming from across the city with a prescription from their doctors saying, my patient has a low income, has diabetes or hypertension or whatever other reason, and requires healthy food.""  Fresh produce  Secord said the food bank, located within the Somerset West Community Health Centre, strives to offer only healthy food, including unlimited fruit and vegetables.  Agnes Nakitende and her family came to Canada from Uganda about six months ago. When they arrived, she said her children started developing food allergies and her husband was diagnosed with diabetes.    Nakitende said the processed food readily available here was partly to blame.  ""When we visited our dietitian he advised us that we need to look into our menu. It meant that now we needed to have more of the veggies, we needed to have more of the fruits, which we could not afford to buy in the stores,"" Nakitende said.  She said her dietitian then directed them toward the Parkdale Food Centre. Armed with a prescription, the family was welcomed with open arms even though they live in another part of town.    'Like angels to me'  Idayat Olugbade was in a similar situation after moving to Ottawa from Nigeria with her three children. She buses about 45 minutes from their shelter in the east end to get to the Parkdale Food Centre.  Olugbade recalls the first time she arrived home with the fresh produce  ""When my children saw it they all cried. I cried, because that's my first time of someone helping me as much as that,"" Olugbade said. ""They're just amazing people here. I don't know where they come from, they're just like angels to me.""    Dr. Laura Muldoon, a family physician in the Somerset West Community Health Centre, said the idea of social prescriptions is spreading within the medical community.   Muldoon said she directs patients to the Parkdale food bank because she knows they have fresh produce, and she knows they accept prescriptions.  ""I haven't ever actually directed anyone to a different food bank to see if that would work,"" Muldoon said.    For the Parkdale Food Centre, though, its reputation as the go-to spot for nutritious food has come at a cost. Secord said when she decided to start accepting the prescriptions, it was partly to prove a point.  ""What I'm trying to do is to show that when people do not have access to healthy food, we indeed have a public health crisis,"" Secord said.  The food bank is now joining with eight other organizations to try to create distribution hubs across the city where people will eventually be able to get fresh food closer to home.",health
40,"Impact of blackface scandal unclear now, may not be revealed until ballots are cast","When a scandal erupts in the middle of an election campaign, there's a natural tendency to want to see what impact it will have on the vote — and often a rush to draw sweeping conclusions from the morsels of data that trickle out in the early days.  The revelations that Justin Trudeau wore blackface on multiple occasions before entering politics is one of those scandals, though it is perhaps without parallel in Canadian political history.  While it raises broader questions about racism in Canada, in the midst of an election campaign it will inescapably also be one of several factors Canadians will be considering when they cast their ballots.  It's too early to say what effect the scandal has had on voting intentions. The first sets of polling data captured entirely after Time magazine published on Wednesday photos of Trudeau wearing blackface at a school fundraiser in 2001 gave conflicting results.  A Nanos Research poll conducted Sept. 19 to 21 found the Liberals trailing the Conservatives by nearly three percentage points nationwide. But in a poll conducted between Sept. 15 and 17, the gap was about two points. Both the Conservatives and Liberals saw a drop in support and all of it within the margin of error.  Forum Research, also in the field between Sept. 19 and 21, found the Conservatives and Liberals tied at 33 per cent apiece. In a Sept. 11 poll, Forum had put the Conservatives ahead by four points. Liberal support actually increased by one point.  So the trend lines are heading in different directions. That could mean there has been no significant impact, but it mostly suggests that more data is needed before conclusions can be drawn. That is about as clear as it gets right now.  Whatever common threads can be pulled from the polls in the coming days, it is the longer-term repercussions that will decide which party will win the election. How voters initially react to a scandal is not always reflective of what they will think about it weeks later.  The more scandal-plagued world of American politics provides a few examples of that.  Not all scandals are politically fatal  On Oct. 7, 2016, the Washington Post published a video of then-candidate Donald Trump boasting about groping women. That day, the CBC's aggregation of presidential polls put Trump behind Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton by a margin of about 3.5 points nationwide.  His numbers tumbled in the subsequent days, with his support dropping by about two points and the gap between him and Clinton increasing to about 7.5 points.  But the impact of the scandal didn't last — by Oct. 27, Trump was back up to 43 per cent support and by Oct. 29 he had pulled to within three points of Clinton. Events, such as two presidential debates and the news that the FBI was investigating emails on Clinton's private server, intervened.  Some scandals can be survived. Gennifer Flowers' testimony in January 1992 that she had an extramarital affair with Bill Clinton did not prevent Clinton from winning the Democratic nomination and the presidency later that year.  But other personal scandals can end a political career. Gary Hart was the frontrunner for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination until rumours of marital infidelity undermined his bid and he eventually withdrew from the primaries. Polls initially suggested little impact on Hart's support, but his credibility had been fatally wounded.  Trudeau already vulnerable on trust  That is the risk for the Liberal leader, regardless of what the polls show over the coming days. Lots of time remains for Trudeau to put the story behind him and focus voters on other issues — there will be three debates between now and election day, which is still four weeks away.  In 2015, Trudeau was able to use the lengthy election campaign to defy his opponents' attacks. Conservative ads said that Trudeau was ""just not ready"", but good performances in the debates helped Trudeau to show voters that was not the case. The attacks no longer resonated because voters didn't believe them.  The Conservatives are now casting Trudeau as ""not as advertised"", while the New Democrats and Greens have tried to paint Trudeau as a false progressive who can't be trusted. After last week, that has all the more potential to resonate.  An Angus Reid Institute poll conducted before last Wednesday suggested that just six per cent of uncommitted voters (those most coveted by all parties) thought Trudeau was racist, while 94 per cent said he was tolerant. The scandal is unlikely to hurt Trudeau on this question, as it doesn't feed into any preconceived notions Canadians have about him — in fact, quite the opposite.  But between being honest or a liar, a slim majority in this poll described him as the latter. Before last week, many Canadians already believed that Trudeau is untrustworthy. Those opposition attacks are now pushing on an open door.  Still, the early numbers are unclear as to whether the scandal has pushed voters away from the Liberals in any big way. It's possible that it won't or that Trudeau will be able to recover if they do. There's lots of campaigning still to go.  But the data gathered before the scandal broke suggested that Trudeau had a vulnerability in this campaign when it came to voters' trust. Whether or not the numbers move in the coming days, the blackface scandal has only amplified that weakness — with consequences that might not become clear for some time yet.

41,"Jagmeet Singh appears on top Quebec talk show, says he shares Quebecers' values","NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh appeared on Quebec's flagship talk show, Tout le monde en parle, Sunday night, saying he shares Quebecers' values on issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage.  Host Guy Lepage asked Singh his take on the province's new religious symbols law, climate change, People's Party Leader Maxime Bernier and the recent scandal involving Justin Trudeau in blackface.   ""I share the same values as Quebecers,"" Singh said. ""I'm for abortion, for same-sex marriage.""  He described himself as ""someone who fell in love with the French language in an English city. I want to be an ally and I will be an ally for Quebec.""  Lepage pointed out Singh is the first racialized person to lead a federal party in Canada and asked his perspective on the Trudeau blackface photos.   ""I've fought against racism with my hands,"" Singh said. ""Not everyone is able to fight back.""  He said Trudeau's decision to wear blackface was bad judgment.   ""For many people it brings up memories of things that happened in their lives,"" Singh said.     When asked about the law formerly known as Bill 21, which would prevent public employees from wearing religious symbols — such as Singh's turban — at work, the NDP leader assured Lepage he's aware of Quebec's ""competence"" in that file, but that he's against laws that divide the population.  ""I think the job of a politician is to find ways to bring people together,"" Singh said.  However, he said an NDP government would not join legal challenges to the law.     Singh repeated that he doesn't think Bernier should take part in the televised leaders debates.  He said it was a difficult decision to make, since he believes in free expression. But Bernier goes too far.    ""There's a moment that it jumps from exchange of ideas to promotion of hateful and divisive ideas that increase tensions,"" Singh said. ""We must not give a platform to a person who divides the population.""   In regard to the environment, Singh said his party has several proposals ideas to create jobs while reducing emissions, such as ecological renovations for buildings.   He said it was a bad decision for the Liberal government to purchase the Trans Mountain Pipeline and that an NDP government would not go ahead with its expansion.  After the Orange Crush  Singh wants to at least hold his party's Quebec seats. NDP support has slumped since Jack Layton's Orange Crush in 2011, when the party took 59 of the province's 78 seats.  CBC's poll tracker suggests the party has, on average, only 8.8 per cent of the vote in the province, while the Greens had 8.7 per cent as of Sunday evening.   Tout le monde en parle, a highly popular weekly talk show, has become a key campaign stop for politicians seeking to sway the province's francophones.   The NDP platform for the province promises more powers on portfolios including the environment, language, immigration and justice.   Singh says he wants his party to be ""an ally to Quebec and the French language.""",politics

43,Barely trained observers hired to monitor wildlife impacts of offshore oil exploration ,"Wildlife observers with little to no experience — and no background in biology — are being deployed to monitor the environmental impact of oil exploration off the coast of Newfoundland, as companies hunt for new fields to develop in the multibillion-dollar industry.  Three seasoned observers, all with at least a decade of field experience, said they've recently worked alongside novice staff with no experience beyond one or two four-day courses.  All the observers contacted by CBCu002FRadio-Canada said they recently saw novice observers regularly miss and misidentify species, and data collected by these inexperienced observers on the environmental impact of seismic activity may be compromised.  Observer courses offered by Edgewise Environmental include a single day of field training. There are no prerequisites to take the training.  Federal regulations require ""qualified"" observers ""trained to identity different species of marine mammals and turtles"" to be aboard seismic vessels surveying undersea oil and gas reserves.  But those same regulations leave the professional training, and background required to be considered a ""qualified"" marine observer, largely undefined.    ""Observers are one of three people on the boat who can shut down the seismic operations, which is a massive responsibility, and all they have is a four-day course? That doesn't add up to me,"" said Stephanie Leger, a biologist and wildlife observer with more than 10 years of experience.  ""Background is so, so important for every other job on the boat. You can't really work as an engineer without being an engineer.""  According to Fisheries and Oceans Canada regulations, marine observers must be present aboard vessels during all seismic surveying, a process whereby air guns produce sound waves that hit the ocean floor.  Before any seismic activity can begin, observers must ensure an exclusion zone surrounding the guns is free of any marine mammals or turtles. Once the surveying starts, they have the authority to call a temporary halt to all seismic activity if a threatened or endangered species is spotted.  Biology degrees not required  Job offers posted to LinkedIn earlier this year by recruitment agency Dovre noted that observers have the ""decision authority to delay or stop a multimillion-dollar seismic activity.""      The observations are being made from a moving platform of a ship that's rolling around in an extremely harsh environment.  - Ian Jones, faculty of biology, Memorial University     Offers posted by Dovre also showed that university-level biology certification is not required for the position, but said candidates needed experience identifying and observing marine life.  Dovre did not respond to emailed questions from CBCu002FRadio-Canada.  ""It takes years of experience to be able to collect this kind of information in a rigorous, quantitative manner,"" said biologist Ian Jones of Memorial University in St. John's.    ""The observations are being made from a moving platform of a ship that's rolling around in an extremely harsh environment. What is being observed is extremely difficult to observe, interpret and identify.""    Ashley Noseworthy, founder and president of Edgewise Environmental, said her courses were never designed to certify elite-level marine observers.  In the absence of any widely available, Newfoundland-specific training for observers — outside certain environmental companies' in-house training — Noseworthy said she hoped to create a standard course on observing marine life in the province's offshore.  ""The whole point of my business is to start building up that accreditation and the programs and giving people a basis to start with so that if they don't have that biology background they at least have something.""  Previously, many observers went abroad for training, taking courses set up according to the regulatory regimes of other countries.   Hole in regulations  In its guidelines on seismic work, the Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board (C-NLOPB), the province's offshore regulator, explains that designated observers ""trained in marine mammal and seabird observations"" must follow monitoring protocols set out by Fisheries and Oceans and the Canadian Wildlife Service.  Fisheries and Oceans directives for minimizing the impact of seismic activity on marine mammals do not require any specific training for offshore observers.  ""We do not oversee the training and experience of marine mammal observers,"" a department spokesperson said.      If you don't set out those standards. then you know, the industry is just going to say, ""OK, well, here are the rules and regulations.""  - Ashley Noseworthy, Edgewise Environmental     A statement from the Canadian Wildlife Service said the federal agency's protocol on seabird observers recommends they have theoretical and practical training, and they be taught by experienced observers.  However, the statement added the ""Canadian Wildlife Service does not oversee approvals of observers for seismic vessels or oil platforms regulated by the C-NLOPB.""  'There's nobody necessarily breaking the rules'  Noseworthy said the federal government should eliminate any vagueness in its regulations surrounding observer qualifications.  ""There's nobody necessarily breaking the rules, because everybody's following the (DFO) Statement of Canadian Practice. The C-NLOPB makes sure that, for example, the seismic industry is providing marine mammal and seabird observers. Qualifications and whatnot, well, what is 'qualified' is yet to be defined,"" Noseworthy said.  ""If you don't set out those standards. then you know, the industry is just going to say, 'OK, well, here are the rules and regulations.'... The Statement of Canadian Practice should be quite clear.""  International comparisons  In a 2012 position statement, the Marine Mammal Observer Association, an international organization of observers, argued a training certificate ""should not be the only requirement to qualify a person as an observer.""  The association said observers should have professional experience identifying and observing marine mammals, and collecting and assimilating data.  Other countries, notably New Zealand and Australia, have much stricter policies regarding wildlife observer qualifications.  In New Zealand, for instance, people looking to become marine observers must complete a government-certified training program. Afterward, candidates must shadow an experienced observer for at least 12 weeks before being deemed qualified.  Each week, observation data collected by wildlife observers aboard seismic ships must be reported to the C-NLOPB. A final report, including all work stoppages and delays due to marine mammal sightings, is also provided to the regulator once a surveying project is complete.  In a statement, the C-NLOPB said shutdowns due to marine mammal sightings have occurred ""a few times, typically for very short durations.""  Read more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador",technology
44,NBC's Peacock to join the streaming fray in April,"Comcast's NBCUniversal said Tuesday that its upcoming streaming service will be called Peacock, in an homage to NBC's logo.  It will become the home for some of the company's most popular shows, including Parks and Recreation and The Office. That means both will be leaving Netflix, although not for several months after Peacock launches.  As Disney, AT&amp;T's WarnerMedia and NBCUniversal prepare to debut their streaming services, they have been taking some of their TV and movie deals away from Netflix, the most popular streaming service. That augurs a future where consumers will have to hunt for their favourite shows and films among lots of different services.  WarnerMedia for example on Tuesday also announced that HBO Max, its upcoming streaming service, will have the U.S. rights to The Big Bang Theory. Netflix on Monday said it's adding Seinfeld.  Peacock, like HBO Max, is launching in April, after Disney Plus and Apple TV Plus, which come out this November. NBCUniversal on Tuesday did not announce a price. The service will have ads.    A spokesperson said there will be an international rollout ""down the road"" but did not provide further details.  Peacock's lineup will include series like 30 Rock, Will &amp; Grace and Cheers, although those won't stream exclusively on Peacock, as well as original new movies and shows.  Reboots of Battlestar Galactica and Saved by the Bell are planned as well as a new comedy series from The Good Place and Parks and Rec creator Mike Schur.

45,B.C. man shown with Trudeau in brownface photo says he doesn't believe Liberal leader is racist ,"One of two men shown posing with Justin Trudeau in one of the infamous photos of the future prime minister wearing racist makeup says he wasn't offended then, and he isn't offended now.  Sunny Khurana's children were students at Vancouver's West Point Grey Academy in 2001, when the school held a fundraising gala with an ""Arabian Nights"" theme. Photos taken that night show Trudeau, then a teacher, smiling in brownface and a turban.  Khurana told host Gloria Macarenko on CBC's On The Coast he's heard the criticism that the costume was demeaning to people of colour, but it didn't register that way to him.  ""I don't recall anybody saying anything negative about it. I don't think the intention was to hurt anybody,"" said Khurana, owner of Guru Bazaar, a sari and fabric store in Surrey, B.C.  The first photo of Trudeau at the gala emerged Wednesday afternoon, and it was followed soon after by two confirmed instances of Trudeau wearing blackface, along with a second photo from the gala, featuring Khurana.    The images have thrown a giant wrench in the Liberal Party's election campaign, as Trudeau faces questions on his true feelings about people of colour. Experts say there is a long history in North America of white people wearing blackface or dark makeup to mock and belittle other cultures.  The Liberal leader has apologized, but he has not been able to say whether there might be more photos to come.    But Khurana said he doesn't see the big deal.  ""The main thing is that Justin Trudeau, as prime minister, never came across as somebody who had racist tendencies,"" said Khurana    Other parents who attended the event told CBC they weren't offended by Trudeau's get-up, and see the scandal as a distraction from the real issues.  ""This was all done in good fun,"" said Jeff Murton.  Private school responds  Trudeau was a volunteer in charge of selling raffle tickets at the fundraiser, according to a gala co-chair, who did not want to be named.  Though many people wore costumes, Trudeau was the only person who blackened his face, the co-chair said.  The school's director of communications, Megan MacMillan, said the concerns raised about the photos of Trudeau ""align with our own values and commitment to inclusion and equality.""    ""Our 2001 gala event was organized by a culturally diverse group of parent volunteers and was intended to be celebratory and respectful. That said, we recognize cultural sensitivities have evolved over the past 18 years,"" MacMillan said in a written statement.  She said the school will be sending parents a letter about the photos.",politics

47,Maurizio Cattelan's golden toilet stolen from British art exhibit,"A unique solid gold toilet that was part of an art exhibit was stolen early Saturday from the magnificent home in England where British wartime leader Winston Churchill was born.  The toilet, valued at roughly £1 million pounds ($1.66 million Cdn), was the work of Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan.  The artwork, called America, had been installed only two days earlier at Blenheim Palace, west of London, after previously being shown to appreciative audiences at the Guggenheim Museum in New York.  Police said the toilet was taken early Saturday by thieves who used at least two vehicles.  Because it had been connected to the palace's plumbing system, police said the toilet's removal caused ""significant damage and flooding"" to the building, a UNESCO World Heritage site filled with valuable art and furniture.  A 66-year-old man was arrested in the case, but he has not been identified or charged.  Inspector Richard Nicholls from Thames Valley Police said police believe the thieves left the spacious property about 4:50 a.m. local time and that the toilet was the only item taken. Closed circuit TV footage is being studied in the investigation.  Prior to the theft, visitors to the Cattelan exhibition could book a three-minute appointment to use the toilet. This had proved popular when the toilet was on display at the Guggenheim.  Toilet not specially guarded  The artist intended the golden toilet to be a pointed satire about excessive wealth. Cattelan has previously said: ""Whatever you eat, a $200 lunch or a $2 hot dog, the results are the same, toilet-wise.""    The theft also comes after Edward Spencer-Churchill told The Times newspaper that the toilet would not be very easy to steal since it was connected to the palace's plumbing.  ""So no, I don't plan to be guarding it,"" he said.

48,Scheer says he'd fast-track pipeline challenges straight to Supreme Court,"A Conservative government would overcome legal objections to building new petroleum pipelines by fast-tracking any cases right to the Supreme Court of Canada, party leader Andrew Scheer says.  Scheer and other Conservatives have for years said Ottawa has to ""assert federal jurisdiction'' to get important projects built, but he has not until now explained what that would mean in practice.  At a campaign stop Wednesday, Scheer was pushed on comments he made in recent days about asserting jurisdiction in the face of objections from Indigenous communities or provincial governments, including Quebec.  ""It's about fast-tracking some of the questions that have been raised by people who oppose the project,'' he said.  ""Fast-tracking those cases to the Supreme Court — referring those types of jurisdictional questions to the Supreme Court right away so that we can get certainty, instead of watching these court cases move slowly up and up, being appealed. We would have taken that directly to get finality on those decisions.''    The inability to get pipelines built has become a major source of frustration and anger in Alberta, where politicians from all parties believe other jurisdictions and communities are deliberately landlocking Alberta oil, harming its economy.  The Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, in particular, has been hit by court challenges from provincial and municipal governments, Indigenous communities and environmental groups.    Indigenous communities and environmental groups challenged federal approval of the expansion and won in a federal Court of Appeal case. After the federal government re-did consultations and approved the project again last spring, the same groups filed new objections. The court has agreed to hear Indigenous complaints, but rejected those brought by others.  Those cases could eventually make their way to the Supreme Court.    The Supreme Court is expected to hear an appeal early next year from the British Columbia government of a B.C. Court of Appeal opinion that the province couldn't restrict what flows through the pipeline, which is considered federal jurisdiction because it crosses provincial borders.  The B.C. case was seen as the final nail in the coffin for former pipeline owner Kinder Morgan's plans to proceed with the project.    Shortly afterwards, Kinder Morgan told the Liberals it was suspending work until the company had the government's guarantee the expansion would go ahead. When the company remained unconvinced in May 2018, the Liberal government stepped in and bought the pipeline for $4.5 billion.  Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the plan was to buy the pipeline, get through all the hurdles to the expansion, and then sell it to a private backer.    Scheer said Wednesday that in many cases the courts found the Liberal government hadn't properly consulted Indigenous communities — even though the courts have made such findings about both Liberal and Conservative governments.  The Court of Appeal's 2016 decision to overturn federal approval of the Northern Gateway pipeline was based on a finding of faulty consultations and reviews done by the former Conservative government.  The same court's decision on Trans Mountain, in August 2018, related to a review process done partly by the former Conservative government and partly by the Liberals.",politics
49,"General Motors strike enters 2nd week, no clear end in sight","The strike against General Motors by 49,000 United Auto Workers in the U.S. entered its second week Monday with progress reported in negotiations but no clear end in sight.  Bargainers met all weekend and returned to talks Monday morning as the strike entered its eighth day.  A person briefed on the negotiations said the two cases are haggling about wages and profit sharing, new product for factories that GM wants to close, a faster route to full wages for new hires and use of temporary workers. The person didn't want to be identified because details of the bargaining are confidential.  Workers walked off their jobs early on Sept. 16, paralyzing production at about 30 manufacturing sites in nine states.  Already, the strike has forced GM to shut down two Canadian factories that make engines, older-model pickup trucks and two car models. If the strike drags on much longer, GM likely will have to close more factories in Mexico and Canada because engines, transmissions and other components are built in the United States.  Companies that supply parts to GM also will have to start cutting production.    Consumers this week will start to see fewer trucks, SUVs and cars on dealer lots. Cox Automotive said GM had stocked up before the strike with a 77-day supply of vehicles. But before the walkout, the supply of larger SUVs such as the Chevrolet Tahoe already was below the industry average of 61 days worth of vehicles.  On Sunday, Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren joined members of the UAW and supporters as they picketed outside GM's Detroit-Hamtramck plant on Sunday.  ""Auto workers deserve good wages, comprehensive benefits, and economic security,"" Warren said.  Bernie Sanders, another Democratic presidential hopeful, will do the same on Wednesday. Sanders is urging GM to ""end the greed, sit down with the UAW and work out an agreement that treats your workers with the respect and the dignity they deserve.""  Workers demand fair share  Workers got their last GM paycheques last week, and will have to start living on $250 US per week in strike pay starting this week.  The union wants a bigger share of GM's more than $30 billion in profits during the past five years. But the company sees a global auto sales decline ahead and wants to bring its labour costs in line with U.S. plants owned by foreign automakers.    The top production worker wage is about $30 an hour, and GM's total labour costs including benefits are about $63 an hour compared with an average of $50 at factories run by foreign-based automakers mainly in southern states.  Issues snagging the talks include the formula for profit sharing, which the union wants to improve. Currently, workers get $1,000 for every $1 billion the company makes before taxes in North America. This year, workers got cheques for $10,750 each, less than last year's $11,500.    Wages also are an issue with the company seeking to shift compensation more to lump sums that depend on earnings and workers wanting hourly increases that will be there if the economy goes south.  They're also bargaining over use of temporary workers and a path to make them full time, as well as a faster track for getting newly hired workers to the top UAW wage.  GM has offered products in two of four locations where it wants to close factories. It has proposed an electric pickup truck for the Detroit-Hamtramck plant and a battery factory in the Lordstown, Ohio, about 125 kilometres from Pittsburgh, where it is closing a small-car assembly plant. The factory would be run by a joint venture, and although it would have UAW workers, GM is proposing they work for pay that's lower than the company pays at assembly plants.  This is the first national strike by the UAW since 2007, when the union shut down General Motors for two days.",business
50,Trudeau says he is 'deeply sorry' he appeared in brownface at school gala in 2001,"Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau says he knows now that his decision to dress up in brownface and a turban for a gala at a private school where he worked 18 years ago was a racist thing to do and he is now ""deeply sorry.""  Trudeau also admitted there was a second instance of racist behaviour. ""When I was in high school I dressed up at a talent show and sang Day-O with makeup on,"" he said.   Speaking to reporters on his campaign plane, Trudeau apologized for his actions, saying that he now recognizes his actions were racist.  ""In 2001, when I was a teacher in Vancouver, I attended a gala. The theme was Arabian Nights. I dressed up in an Aladdin costume and put makeup on. I shouldn't have done that. I should have known better, but I didn't and I'm really sorry.  ""I take responsibility for my decision to do that. I shouldn't have done it. I should have known better. It was something that I didn't think was racist at the time, but now I recognize it was something racist to do and I am deeply sorry.""  The 2001 incident  was brought to light Wednesday evening by an article in Time Magazine.  The article details how the picture of Trudeau appears in the 2000-01 yearbook of the West Point Grey Academy, a private school in Vancouver.   Time Magazine said Vancouver businessman Michael Adamson, who was a part of the West Point Grey Academy community, brought the photograph to the magazine's attention because he said he thought it should be made public.   Another image that appears to be Trudeau at the same school gala was posted in an April 2001 newsletter for the Vancouver school. The additional image, which is available in an online archive, surfaced after Trudeau first addressed his use of brownface and apologized for it.    Asked if he should resign his position as Liberal leader based on both incidents, Trudeau made the case that incidents like this should be treated on a ""case-by-case"" basis.   ""There are people who make mistakes in this life and you make decisions based on what they actually do, what they did and on a case-by-case basis. I deeply regret that I did that. I should have known better but I didn't,"" he said.     Trudeau said that he found out the story was going to break earlier in the day.  Asked if he understood why brownface and blackface was so hurtful to minorities Trudeau said he did.   ""I think it's well known that communities and people that live with intersectionalities and face discrimination the likes of which I have never personally had to experience is a significant thing that is very hurtful and that is why I am so deeply disappointed in myself,"" he said.     Unfit for office, Scheer says  Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said both incidents prove that Trudeau is not fit to hold the office of prime minister.   ""Like all Canadians, I was extremely shocked and disappointed when I learned of Justin Trudeau's actions this evening,"" Scheer said. ""Wearing brownface is an act of open mockery and racism. It was just as racist in 2001 as it is in 2019.  ""And what Canadians saw this evening was someone with a complete lack of judgment and integrity and someone who is not fit to govern this country.""    NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Trudeau's behaviour was ""troubling"" and ""insulting.""   ""It's making a mockery of someone for what they live and what their lived experiences are,"" Singh said. ""I think he needs to answer for it. I think he needs to answer the question why he did that and what does that say about what he thinks about people who, because of who they are, because of the colour of their skin, face challenges and barriers and obstacles in their life.""  ""Racism is real. People in this room have felt it, have heard this story. I've experienced it in my life. he's got to answer those questions.""    After Trudeau's apology Singh delivered a message to Canadian children of colour.   ""The kids that see this image, the people that see this image, are going to think about all the times in their life that they were made fun of, that they were hurt, that they were hit, that they were insulted, that they were made to feel less because of who they are and I want to talk to those people right now,"" Singh said.   ""I want to talk to all the kids out there,"" he said. ""You might feel like giving up on Canada. You might feel like giving up on yourselves. I want you to know that you have value, you have worth and you are loved and I don't want you to give up on Canada and please don't give up on yourselves.""    Incident 'reprehensible': Canadian Muslim organization  The National Council of Canadian Muslims said Trudeau's appearance in brownface was ""reprehensible.""  ""Seeing the prime minister in brownfaceu002Fblackface is deeply saddening,"" said NCCM's Executive Director Mustafa Farooq in a Tweet. ""The wearing of blackfaceu002Fbrownface is reprehensible, and hearkens back to a history of racism and an Orientalist mythology which is unacceptable.""    The council said that while it recognizes that people can change and evolve over time, it was critical that Trudeau ""unequivocally apologizes"" for the incident. After Trudeau made his public apology, the NCCM issued another tweet thanking him.",politics
51,"Love it, list it or litigate? Home reno show crew denies liability after disgruntled couple sues","The producers and a contractor behind the home reno show Love It Or List It Vancouver have denied all the accusations made by a dissatisfied couple who sued them last year, saying all the renovations at the heart of the lawsuit were completed properly.  Even if the work hadn't been done right, a response to the civil claim said, it wouldn't matter because the North Vancouver, B.C., homeowners gave up any right to sue when they signed a sweeping contract agreeing to be on the show.  ""The plaintiffs assumed any and all liability for all of the renovation work following the [on-air] reveal,"" read the court document filed in July on behalf of the production company and the contractor.  Jeanine Almeida and Norman Waine filed their lawsuit against the company behind the show on May 9, 2018, claiming producers brought in an actor with no contracting experience to work on their Lynn Valley home for their episode.     The couple also claimed the renovation was riddled with defects that could lead to mould, fires, water damage and high concentrations of carbon dioxide — putting their family's health and safety at risk.  None of the couple's allegations have been proven in court.     Watch the episode here    The company, its producers and the contractor have asked for the case to be dismissed entirely.  The response to the couple's claim, filed in B.C. Supreme Court, said the renovation is up to code. It also said the contractor is not an actor and has 30 years of experience in construction.    Almeida, Waine and their four children appeared on season four of the show in 2016.       During each episode, families have to decide whether to keep their current home. Two hosts, one real estate agent and one designer, try to sway participants to move or stay.  The real estate agent works to find a new house on the market suited to the family, while the designer renovates the participants' current home. At the end of the episode, homeowners choose to move or stay in their spruced-up old house, which is shown to them in a walk-through on camera.  Almeida and Waine claimed they paid the show's production company, Should I Stay or Should I Go West Productions, more than $175,000 for the renovation.    The kitchen, dining room, laundry room, garage and back deck were transformed. During the on-air reveal of their new house, Almeida and Waine said they loved the ""gorgeous"" final product.  They claimed issues cropped up after the show aired.  In their lawsuit, the couple said they signed a contract agreeing that work would be carried out by Kenny Gemmill, the show's resident contractor, or a ""reasonable alternative."" Almeida and Waine claimed the show instead hired Kerry van der Griend, whom they described as an actor with ""little to no experience"" as a general contractor.       The defendants said that allegation alone is ""reckless"" and false. The court filing said the couple's allegations have harmed Van der Griend personally and professionally.  Almeida and Waine are asking for damages for breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation, as well as general and special damages. They did not specify how much compensation they were seeking.  The defendants denied the couple ""suffered any loss, damage or expense, as alleged or at all.""

52,False online rumour claims RCMP chief is married to Bill Morneau's cousin,"A rumour that RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki's husband is related to Finance Minister Bill Morneau was shared widely online over the past week. The rumour claims the supposed familial relationship is the reason the RCMP has not launched an official investigation into the Trudeau government's handling of the SNC-Lavalin scandal.  But it's not true. Morneau and Lucki's husband aren't related.  The unfounded rumour appears to be based on hearsay and was first mentioned by a Twitter account with fewer than 500 followers, offering no evidence of a link between the two officials. The rumour was then amplified to reach an audience of tens of thousands of Canadians on Facebook and Twitter in a matter of days.   Asked about the rumour by CBC News, both the RCMP and Morneau responded with statements confirming there was no family relationship between Lucki's husband, Ray Gauthier, and Bill Morneau.    ""These allegations are false,"" said a spokesperson for Bill Morneau's campaign team in an email to CBC News.  Acting Sgt. Caroline Duval, an RCMP spokesperson, told CBC the force had confirmed that Gauthier is not related to Morneau.  CBC News also reviewed publicly-available family trees for both Morneau and Lucki's husband, as well as several family obituaries, and could find no link between the two.  Primed to go viral  This kind of rumour is primed to go viral because it fits into an existing belief system, said Christopher Schneider, an associate professor of sociology at Brandon University in Manitoba who studies social media and policing.  ""There's already an existent narrative that this particular meme and rumour can be placed neatly into, whether it's real or false,"" Schneider said. ""They want to believe that there's some sort of dirt, or something going on with the investigation, or that there is corruption there.""  He added that the specifics of the rumour are believable but hard to verify — which makes it even more likely to be shared.  ""It's also not completely implausible. It's not a meme that says, 'Brenda Lucki has two heads and secretly hides one of her heads.' The idea that she could be married to somebody's cousin doesn't seem out of the realm of possibility,"" Schneider said.  The rumour also emerged as the RCMP is facing questions about its own internal affairs, after senior intelligence officer Cameron Ortis was charged with violating Canada's official secrets act.  First tweeted by account with just a few hundred followers  The first mention of the rumour that CBC managed to find on social media appeared on Aug. 26. In a response to a tweet about the RCMP and SNC-Lavalin, an unidentified person who goes by ""Kim"" claimed that they had obtained information from a retired RCMP officer.  ""[Minister of Public Security] Ralph Goodale has tied the hands of the commissioner, who is married to a relative of Bill Morneau,"" this person claimed, offering no evidence.  In fact, in a later tweet, the user expressed frustration over being unable to find any information about the family of Lucki or Gauthier. When contacted via Twitter, the person running the account refused to speak with CBC. The initial tweet was shared 29 times.  That tweet is the earliest instance of the allegation that CBC News could find online. All of the early tweets and Facebook posts propagating the rumour either cite this tweet, or other posts referencing it, as evidence. No earlier traces of the rumour have been found and the original tweeter seems to indicate that they obtained their information from an in-person conversation, not from an online source.    The unfounded rumour had a limited spread immediately following its first mention. CBC News managed to find a handful of tweets referencing it, as well as some Facebook posts, none of which garnered a large number of reactions.  But on September 10, the false story began picking up steam. The rumour began popping up in response to reporters' tweets about a Globe &amp; Mail story alleging that the Trudeau government had refused to lift cabinet confidentiality on the SNC-Lavalin issue, blocking RCMP inquiries into whether the SNC-Lavalin case amounted to obstruction of justice.  The Globe also reported that the RCMP were pausing their inquiries because of the federal election campaign.   Mentions of the rumour also appeared in responses to a tweet by an obscure Canadian conspiracy website on Sept. 13. Some of those responses claimed Lucki herself was Morneau's cousin; the website subsequently tweeted out the cousin rumour later in the day.  From there, the story reached a larger audience beginning September 15, when memes featuring pictures of Lucki and Morneau and the false rumour of their connection started to emerge. Several partisan commentators and pages on both Twitter and Facebook shared these memes, generating thousands of shares and comments.    Exact numbers are difficult to determine because many different versions of the memes and posts pushing the rumour were shared across social media platforms.  The story was posted on Sept. 16 by Alberta Canada Campaign, a Facebook page that's part of a network of partisan pages created by former Conservative Party organizer Larry Brandt. The post was shared 3,300 times. (Incidentally, the person listed as the administrator of Alberta Canada Campaign, Maureen Gow Zelmer, was also one of the first people to post the rumour to Facebook on Aug. 26.)  ""A rumour like this quickly gains a life of its own,"" Schneider said. ""Even while news journalists investigate this and debunk it, that does not necessarily deter the circulation and the virality, because in certain circumstances, people want to believe this.""",technology
53,U.S. excludes another 437 Chinese-made product types from Trump's tariffs next month,"The U.S. has exempted another 437 types of products from China from the tariffs Washington had previously threatened to impose on them, in the latest sign that the combatants in the Sino-American trade war are getting a little gun-shy.  According to documents posted on the website of the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative on Friday, the agency has granted temporary exemptions to hundreds of products that had previously been slated to have tariffs of between 10 and 25 per cent imposed on them under proclamations that U.S. President Donald Trump has made in recent months.  The products run the gamut from consumer products such as lamp shades, Christmas lights, coffee filters, dog leashes and bicycles to industrial products such as electric motors and generators, all the way to highly sophisticated technology components such as ultrasonic scanners and MRI parts.  According to Chinese media outlet CCTV, the entire list covers about one-eighth — or less than 13 per cent — of the original list of $250 billion worth of Chinese goods that Trump had targeted in his trade war earlier this year.  Trump has been putting tariffs — taxes imposed on importers when they bring goods into the country — on Chinese goods as a way of trying to pressure Beijing into balancing the trade relationship between the two countries.    His latest round of tariffs were set to kick in on Oct. 15, but Friday's news means the 437 items on the exemption list won't have any tariffs imposed on them on that date. The USTR documents make it clear, however, that the exemptions are not permanent, which leaves the door open to reimposing them later on.  The move comes as U.S. and Chinese negotiators had face-to-face talks in Washington this week. With another round of tariffs set to be implemented soon, strategist Chris Krueger of Cowan Research Group said ""we would interpret another delay as a goodwill gesture.""  Last week, China made such a gesture of its own by exempting 16 different types of U.S. agricultural products, including soybeans and pork, from its own import levies, a move that Krueger described as ""the quid for the quo of some tariff relief.""  ""All of this could go sideways [again],"" he said, but added that even such a modest rapprochement on the trade file could be ""a signal that the trade war is entering into a frozen conflict.""",business
54,NDP promises free dental care for households making under $70K starting in 2020,"The NDP is promising free dental care for households making under $70,000 starting next year if it wins a mandate in the federal election.  NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh made the announcement in Sudbury, Ont., Wednesday morning on Day 8 of the election campaign.  The party says it would immediately implement a public dental care plan to cover uninsured Canadians.  Dental care would be free for households making under $70,000, with a sliding co-payment for those earning between $70,000 and $90,000.  The party says the covered services would include examinations, cleanings and fluoride rinses, x-rays, teeth fillings, crowns, root canals, treatments for gum disease, dentures and braces for non-cosmetic purposes.  The party estimates its initial plan would cover 4.3 million Canadians and would save a family of four (if the household makes $70,000 or less) roughly $1,240.    ""It is bold, it is exciting, I'm kind of getting goosebumps when I think about it because we can actually cover so many Canadians that don't have coverage,"" Singh told reporters.  ""It'll make people healthier.""  The Parliamentary Budget Office costed the plan and said it would cost nearly $1.9 billion for 2020-2021, ""because we assume that untreated oral diseases occurring prior to 2020 are treated in 2020.""  Watch: Singh promises dental care plan for low-income Canadians    That PBO estimate drops to $824 million in 2021-2022 and remains relatively stable at $856 million by 2028-2029.  Singh said the coverage would come under a federal insurance program, which would help avoid negotiations with the provinces. The party said dentists and community health centres would be reimbursed for the services they provide.  Singh called the announcement ""a down payment"" on party founder Tommy Douglas's goal of having dental care included in Canada's health care system.  The party laid out the bare bones of a plan back in June in an early platform release.  ""A New Democrat government will work together with provincial partners, health professionals and dentists to develop a roadmap to including dental care in the Canada Health Act,"" says the document.",health
55,Why people who need help most lose out on election handout promises: Don Pittis,"There is lots of research that shows the best thing you could do for the Canadian economy in the long run is to wipe out poverty and help young people.  While parties of the left and right may identify differing strategies to do it, most politicians know poverty and youth-gone-wrong are bad for the country as a whole. They contribute to crime and poor health outcomes and create a lingering burden on the better off parts of the economy.  But experts who have studied the phenomenon say something strange happens to those good intentions during elections. They say the calculus of winning forces political parties that want to win into narrowing their focus to the richer and the older.  ""In our system, once the election thinking takes over, the professionals take over in a sense and their basic goal is to maximize returns, in other words, 'How do we maximize the number of seats we can win?'"" says Henry Milner, a scholar who has written extensively on Canadian and Quebec democracy.   The essential goal of those professional campaign organizers, the shadowy people behind the politicians charged with getting their candidates elected, is to identify undecided voters and appeal to the majority of them.   ""Very seldom are those young people or poor people,"" says Milner, author of The Internet Generation: Engaged Citizens or Political Dropouts, who has a research chair in electoral studies at the University of Montreal.  Voting at 16?  Repeated studies in Canada and elsewhere have shown that younger and poorer people don't exercise their right to vote at the same rate as those who are older and wealthier.  While most Canadian electoral research doesn't focus directly on income — including the 2016 Statistics Canada report on the rise in voting turnouts between the 2011 and the most recent 2015 federal election — proxies for income such as education levels and home ownership show it happens here as well.      According to Milner, it may be that young and poorer people are focused on factors other than electoral politics. Poorer people may be in ethnic subgroups, busy with lives in turmoil or without a tradition of political participation.  Similarly when young people hit voting age at 18 they are often at an unstable point. Having just finished high school, they are struggling to find work or housing or finding their way in relationships and post-secondary eduction.    That's why one of Milner's proposals is to experiment with a voting age of 16 to inculcate the tradition of voting while young people are still embedded in a relatively stable life of home and school.  Milner says not being exposed to traditional sources of Canadian news such as radio, TV or newspapers may also make a difference.  ""The internet yes, if you are interested in [politics] you can find it easily, but if you're not interested particularly, it is just so easy to avoid it entirely,"" says Milner.  However there are signs political leaders should be wary of assuming young voters are ill-informed when issues arise that strike a chord. The CBC site for Snapchat, the source used by some of the youngest media viewers, got hundreds of thousands of hits within a few hours following the Justin Trudeau brownface story.  Youth issues   ""You could have a special case where an issue comes up that really affects young people,"" says Milner. ""One might argue that climate change may be emerging as such.""  Certainly youth voting bounced back from what experts called crisis levels before the 2015 vote where fewer than 40 per cent of eligible voters between 18 and 25 cast their vote. Those low levels led some to suggest voting would have to be made compulsory. And even 2015's rebound  of seven percentage points left the youth vote far behind older groups.  Milner is convinced Trudeau's image as a youthful outsider who young voters could identify with was partly responsible for a recovery from the lowest levels. Election experts will be waiting anxiously to see whether, once drawn into the election process, they will vote again this time.  The other reason that long-term economic proposals are not directed at the young is that there's evidence younger people don't pay attention, tending to live in the moment. However, economic issues that affect young people directly, such as sharp rises in tuition in Quebec, attracted the attention of young voters.    Another long-time scholar of the electoral process, Keith Banting, currently at the School of Policy Studies at Ontario's Queen's University, says a new feeling of anxiety among the Canadian middle class has made politicians wary of explicitly targeting economic policy toward the poor.  ""It's not a surprise to me that we have over the last 20 years shifted our priorities from helping the poor to helping people who are under pressure in the broad middle class,"" says Banting.  Redistribution by stealth  He says research by the people in the centre-left of U.S. politics has determined that fighting poverty does not motivate voters, so instead they drew voters to the polls by focusing on ""the stressed middle."" Essentially they found people were so worried about themselves they seem unable to think about helping those less fortunate.  In Canada too, says Banting, anti-poverty policies, while good for the economy over the long term, are simply not politically sustainable. Instead, Canada's parties, which all cling to the political centre and realize the benefits of bringing the poorest into the more active part of the Canadian economy, indulge in something Banting calls ""redistribution by stealth.""  As an example, Banting recalls an eight-page Liberal Party document on child benefit payments which would clearly help poor people the most but was also clearly addressed to the better off people whose political support the party needed.   ""The word poverty did not appear in the document but it was sold as helping the middle class and, quote, those struggling hard to join us.""     Follow Don on Twitter @don_pittis",business
56,The Cars lead singer Ric Ocasek dead at 75,"Ric Ocasek — The Cars lead singer whose deadpan vocal delivery and lanky, sunglassed look defined a rock era with chart-topping hits like Just What I Needed — was discovered dead Sunday afternoon in his Manhattan apartment.  The New York Police Department said that officers found the 75-year-old Ocasek at about 4 p.m. ET after responding to a 911 call. They said there were no signs of foul play and that the medical examiner was to determine a cause of death.  The death comes a year after The Cars were inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, followed by an announcement by model Paulina Porizkova on social media that she and Ocasek had separated after 28 years of marriage. The pair first met while filming the music video for Drive, another Cars hit.  Ocasek — who sang, played guitar and wrote most of the band's songs — and Benjamin Orr, who played bass and also sang, were ex-hippie buddies who formed The Cars in Boston in 1976. They were a decade older than many of their modern-rock compatriots but became one of the most essential American bands of the late 1970s and 1980s with their fusion of new wave, 1960s pop and 1970s glam.  Ocasek's minimalist, half-spoken deadpan vocals set made the band's sound, and his long, lanky appearance formed their lasting image.  The first three songs on their 1978 self-titled first album were all hit singles and remain widely known classics and oldies radio airplay: Good Times Roll, My Best Friend's Girl and Just What I Needed.    They had 10 other singles in the Billboard top 40, and of their six studio albums, four were in Billboard's top 10.  The band's commercial peak came with 1984's Heartbeat City, which featured the hit singles You Might Think and Magic, sung by Ocasek, and the atypical ballad Drive, sung by Orr.  They were always an MTV favourite, and the whimsical, partly animated video for You Might Think along with the mournful video for Drive brought them near-constant airplay on the channel in the mid-1980s.  The band broke up in 1988, but their influence would be deeply felt in the 1990s and beyond. Kurt Cobain and Nirvana covered My Best Friend's Girl at their last live show in 1994, and Ocasek produced albums for a diverse list of artists including Weezer, No Doubt, Bad Brains, Bad Religion, Suicide, Le Tigre, Guided by Voices and Romeo Void.    The Cars were inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in 2018 after being nominated twice before. During the ceremony, Ocasek paid tribute to Orr, who died in 2000 of pancreatic cancer.  ""It's quite strange to be here without him,"" Ocasek said.  In announcing the separation last year, Porizkova said that their family is ""a well-built car."" But she says that ""as a bicycle, my husband and I no longer pedal in unison."" Ocasek had six sons, two from each of his three marriages.  He grew up in Baltimore, and his family moved to Cleveland when he was a teenager. After graduating high school he had stints at Antioch College and Bowling Green State University in the mid-1960s before dropping out to pursue music.  Ocasek met Orr in 1965 and they formed their own first band called ID Nirvana in 1968. In the 1970s they relocated to Boston and formed bands including the folk-rock Milkwood and also played as an acoustic duo before finding their calling when they created The Cars.  Weezer, Carl Newman of New Pornographers and Greg Harris, the CEO of the Rock Hall, were among those who paid tribute on social media.",entertainment
57,NDP's dental plan seen as smart policy - but some costs are uncertain,"The Claim:  ""It's about choices. $860 million to assure that 4.3 million Canadians have dental services is a priority for us.""  -- NDP leader Jagmeet Singh, announcing his party's vow to provide free dental care to Canadians whose household incomes are less than $70,000 a year and don't already have private or public coverage.  The Facts: The NDP plan, unveiled Wednesday morning at an event in Sudbury, Ont., aims to provide full, federally funded dental coverage to uninsured individuals with a household income of less than $70,000 a year. It would also pay a portion of the costs — on a sliding scale — for uninsured households making up to $90,000.   The plan would begin in January 2020 and cover an extensive array of preventative and restorative services, including exams, cleanings, fluoride treatments, X-rays, filings, crowns, root canals and treatment for gum diseases, as well as the cost of dentures and braces for non-cosmetic purposes.   And the NDP hopes to extend it even further, with Singh billing it as ""our first step toward the dream of universal denticare for all.""   The Office of the Parliamentary Budget Officer has costed the NDP plan, crunching data on the number of currently uninsured individuals, household income, the prevalence of dental problems and treatment fees, estimating that about three-quarters of all eligible people would actually use the program.   On that basis, the PBO says that the cost for the first, partial fiscal year would be $560 million, then rise to $1.884 billion in fiscal 2020u002F21 — a ""one-time"" surge due to oral diseases that had previously gone untreated. After that, the program will cost around $830 million a year through 2024u002F25, rising to $856 million by 2028u002F29.    The PBO says its estimate has ""moderate uncertainty,"" due to its assumptions about population growth, disease prevalence, utilization rates, inflation and the possibility that the new federal plan might cause existing public and private insurers to reduce or cancel their coverage, thereby increasing Ottawa's costs.   How far would all that money go?  The NDP provides an example of a family of four — two adults, two children — with an income of $70,000. Assuming that each family member has one dental exam, two cleanings, and that each child has a cavity filled, the party says their savings under the program would be $1,240, or $310 each.  Many have no coverage  According to statistics provided by the Canadian Dental Association, the estimated total expenditure on dental services in this country in 2015 was $13.6 billion — about $380 per capita. But given that up to a third of Canadians have no public or private coverage and visit the dentist infrequently, if ever, the actual average cost per patient is surely much higher.  And if the NDP were to succeed in convincing 4.3 million more people to seek dental care each year, the Parliamentary Budget Officer's estimates might be on the low side. For example, in the unlikely scenario of 100 per cent utilization, the $831 million earmarked for 2022u002F23 works out to just $193.26 per person.  A lot will depend on details that have yet to be provided.  ""We're very interested to understand clearly who is going to be covered and what will be covered and to what degree,"" says Dr. Sandy Mutchmor, president of the Canadian Dental Association.   Mutchmor says it's hard to assign a per procedure cost; there are small cavities and big ones, some cleanings are more difficult than others — it's a matter of time and complexity. And as the PBO has estimated with its second-year surge, people who haven't been seeing the dentist on a regular basis are likely to need more extensive and frequent treatment, at least initially.     Still, the CDA welcomes the NDP proposal. ""Anything that provides more treatment is a step in the right direction,"" says Mutchmor.    There could also be a net saving to other parts of the health-care system.  Would relieve a lot of suffering  Dr. Gerry Uswak, an associate dean at the University of Saskatchewan College of Dentistry and past president of the Canadian Association of Public Health Dentistry, says the NDP plan would relieve a great deal of dental pain and suffering and help with the treatment of other chronic diseases.  He points to non-insulin dependent diabetes as an example. Some patients develop a related periodontal disease. And their diabetes is much harder to control if the reciprocal gum infection is left untreated.   ""That's the best use of public funds,"" says Uswak, ""getting people the care they need sooner rather than later.""   Dr. Carlos Quiñonez, an associate professor of dentistry at the University of Toronto who studies the intersection of politics and teeth, says the plan addresses a need.  ""There's clearly people out there who can't access dental care,"" he says. ""And it's not just really low-income groups. We've done research that shows that affordability challenges are now reaching into even the middle-income categories.""   Quiñonez says the budget estimate for the program sounds a bit low — provincial dental plans are spending between $300 to $700 per patient. However, the NDP proposal would effectively double the amount that Canadian governments are spending on dental care, which would be a good thing.  ""The idea of providing more coverage is definitely a laudable and worthwhile endeavour,"" says Quiñonez. ""But the devil is in the details.""  The Verdict: It's complicated. The Parliamentary Budget Officer has provided a price tag for the NDP plan, but the absence of details makes it hard to say whether the amount will be enough to provide dental coverage to 4.3 million more people, as Jagmeet Singh has promised.

58,"Trudeau apologizes again, says he can't remember exact number of blackface incidents","In his first formal press conference since the blackface scandal erupted, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau said today his privileged upbringing blinded him to the profound harm caused by his past racist acts.  At a campaign event in Winnipeg Thursday, Trudeau apologized directly to racialized Canadians after more bombshell images surfaced of him in blackface.  Trudeau said he did not understand at the time how hurtful his actions were and, as a result, he can't remember exactly how many times he has worn blackface makeup.  ""I am wary of being definitive about this. The recent pictures I had not remembered,"" he said when pressed by reporters about the number of incidents.  ""I think the question is, 'How can you not remember that?' The fact is, I didn't understand how hurtful this is to people who live with discrimination every single day. I have always acknowledged I come from a place of privilege, but I now need to acknowledge that comes with a massive blind spot.""  On Wednesday evening, Trudeau recounted just two incidents of blackface. A third image of him in blackface surfaced in video form Thursday.  Trudeau said he never spoke about the incidents before now because he was ""embarrassed,"" adding that his past actions do not define the politician he has become since.  ""What I did ... hurt people who shouldn't have to face intolerance and discrimination because of their identity. This is something that I deeply, deeply regret,"" he said.  ""Darkening your face, regardless of the context of the circumstances, is always unacceptable because of the racist history of blackface. I should have understood that then, and I never should have done it.""    The Liberal campaign is in full-blown damage control mode over a scandal that threatens to put the Trudeau brand and the party's electoral fortunes in jeopardy.  Trudeau, known globally for his ""diversity is our strength"" mantra, is making international headlines after photographs and a video emerged showing him in racist makeup. He apologized late Wednesday and admitted his past actions were racist.  Trudeau spent the first part of today reaching out to candidates, party staff and community leaders to try to explain his actions. The Liberal campaign cancelled a morning event before scheduling an afternoon media event in Winnipeg.  'Terrible mistake'  He asked Canadians to forgive him for what he acknowledged was a ""terrible mistake.""  ""I have dedicated my leadership and my service to Canada to try and counter intolerance and racism everywhere I can, but this has been ... a moment I've had to reflect on the fact that wanting to do good and wanting to do better simply isn't good enough,"" he said.  He said he spoke with his own children about the incidents, a conversation the campaign said was held via Facetime, and he became emotional when he spoke of parents having ""uncomfortable and hurtful"" conversations with their own kids today because of his actions.  Asked if he's considering stepping aside to let someone else lead the party through the election, Trudeau did not answer directly, but said he would ""continue to do the work that is necessary to keep us moving forward in the right way.""    ""Canadians have an important choice to make on October 21st and I trust Canadians to make that right choice,"" he said.  ""I certainly hope that they will continue to support us in the work that we're doing, but they might not. And I know that is something that all Canadians get to decide and they get to bring in all sorts of different factors, because every Canadian has a different way of looking at what matters to them.""  The controversy is drawing mixed reactions from the Liberal ranks.    Greg Fergus, a black Liberal MP seeking re-election in Hull-Aylmer, Que., said Trudeau should be judged on his ""great record"" promoting equality and diversity, not on incidents nearly 20 years in the past.  ""I think those are really the measure of the man and that's the reason why I have confidence in his continuing leadership,"" he said.    Fergus said the prime minister likely did not divulge his past behaviour earlier because he was embarrassed and ashamed. He said Trudeau called him personally before the story emerged late Wednesday.  Fergus said many of the black Canadians he has spoken with since the scandal broke are confused and offended.  'People are feeling hurt'  ""It's going to be rough. People are feeling hurt,"" he said.  The 2001 incident, which saw a 29-year-old Trudeau wear blackface as part of an Aladdin costume for a school fundraising event called Arabian Nights, was brought to light by an article in Time Magazine. A photo and separate video of other incidents were subsequently released showing Trudeau in racist makeup.  Omar Alghabra, who is seeking re-election as a Liberal MP for Mississauga Centre, also received a call from Trudeau before the story broke. He said the prime minister wanted to give him heads up, to apologize and to extend a commitment to continue his work.  Despite the warning, he said he was taken aback by the images.    ""My heart sank,"" he said. ""It's not something I expected to see Justin Trudeau doing. But I can't really explain how or why it happened.""  Alghabra said he did not know Trudeau 20 years ago, but the man he knows now fights against hate, intolerance and prejudice.  ""He's been a champion to combat against the type of pain this picture is causing,"" he said.  ""The person I know of Justin Trudeau for the last seven or eight years is a champion against intolerance and racism. Not just lip service, but with real deeds and real action. That is the Justin Trudeau I know. I can't explain those pictures.""  Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi issued a strong statement condemning the images.  ""I was very disheartened and disappointed to see these images. These indefensible images bring back many painful memories of racism that I and other racialized Canadians have experienced throughout their lives,"" he said.  Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan said today that what Trudeau did ""was wrong then, and it's wrong now,"" but his policies show a commitment to promoting diversity.  ""Absolutely, those pictures are hurtful. I know how much he regrets it,"" Sajjan said in an interview Thursday with CBC Radio's The Early Edition host Stephen Quinn in Vancouver.    Katie Omstead, the Liberal candidate for Chatham-Kent-Leamington, issued a statement Thursday saying that she is ""disappointed"" by the images.  ""I simply don't care how old these images are. Being a teacher, my heart goes out to students everywhere who have been affected by racism, homophobia and bullying,"" she said.  ""We've seen him apologize sincerely, and accept full responsibility. I know, as does he, how serious this is. We need to continue to have conversations about discrimination, and what we can do to teach our children, and those of us who lead, to respect the diversity of all Canadians. We all need to be better.""    Part of the Liberal campaign strategy has been to call out Conservative candidates for past indiscretions. Some opponents are calling Trudeau a hypocrite today.  Liberal commentator Susan Smith said Trudeau must keep apologizing and emphasizing the work he has done on diversity as an MP and as prime minister, such as appointing a diverse cabinet, welcoming Syrian refugees and promoting Indigenous reconciliation and gender equality.  ""For voters, the intent, the track record as PM and the future vision will likely matter more than the distant past,"" Smith said.    ""When the dust settles, I think the real question for Canadians is, 'Do you think Justin Trudeau is a racist?' And if people are being honest with themselves, the answer is, 'No.'""    While it may be a factor for some Canadians on voting day, Smith said she doubts it will be a key ballot issue.    Former Liberal MP Marlene Jennings defended Trudeau on Twitter, praising him for owning up to his mistakes ""openly, honestly"" and making real efforts to do better.  Liberal MP Nick Whalen tweeted that he spoke about the issue with his children, saying they immediately understood that ""dressing up as cultures"" is wrong, disrespectful and oppressive.",politics
59,Meng Wanzhou back in spotlight as lawyers set to argue for disputed arrest documents,"Vancouver makes an unlikely front line in the battle between global superpowers.  But the Huawei executive whose arrest last year placed Canada in the middle of a conflict between China and the United States will again take centre stage in a B.C. courtroom this week.  Meng Wanzhou's lawyers will begin eight days of hearings Monday, scheduled to argue for access to documents related to her initial detention and arrest at Vancouver's airport last December on a warrant for extradition to the U.S.  In the time since the Huawei chief financial officer's last in-person court appearance in May, tensions between Canada and China have only worsened.  The relationship between China and the United States has also further deteriorated — and as they make their case, Meng's lawyers will argue that U.S. President Donald Trump is using their client as a bargaining chip in a trade war.  ""The U.S. is attempting to use these extradition proceedings for economic and political gain,"" Meng's defence team said in a document filed with the court in advance of this week's hearing.  Accused of violating U.S. sanctions  Meng — daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei — was arrested on Dec. 1, 2018, on a stopover from Hong Kong to Mexico City. Her ultimate destination was Buenos Aires.  Both Meng and Huawei as a company face 13 criminal counts of conspiracy, fraud and obstruction in the U.S.  The charges relate to an alleged scheme to circumvent sanctions against Iran through Skycom, a shadow company in Tehran that prosecutors claim was actually controlled by Huawei.    Meng is accused of lying about the relationship of the two companies to an HSBC executive during a meeting at a Hong Kong restaurant in 2013 — allegedly putting U.S. banks at risk of violating sanctions.  Both she and Huawei have denied all the allegations.  The 47-year-old has been living under a form of house arrest in one of her two multi-million-dollar Vancouver homes after being released on $10 million bail in the weeks following her initial detention.  'Unlawfully detained, searched and interrogated'  Last December, President Donald Trump said he would be willing to intervene with the U.S. Justice Department in the case against Meng, if it would help secure a trade deal with Beijing.  In documents filed with the court in advance of this week's proceedings, Meng's lawyers claim Trump's comments provide ""important context to what occurred"" in the days and hours leading up to her arrest.  They accuse American and Canadian authorities of using the CBSA's extraordinary powers of detention to mount a ""covert criminal investigation"" against their client.  They claim RCMP originally planned to arrest Meng on the plane, but changed their minds for some unknown reason.  Notes included in a defence application for documents also show that a CBSA officer asked Meng about Huawei's business in Iran as she watched him inspect her bags.    Meng's lawyers ultimately plan to argue that all those factors contribute to abuses of process serious enough to have the case tossed.  But first they hope to convince B.C. Supreme Court Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes to order the disclosure of notes, emails, texts, reports and any other documents they believe will help them make their case.  ""[Meng] submits that she was unlawfully detained, searched and interrogated at YVR under a ruse carried out by the CBSA, RCMP and American authorities, for the benefit of and likely at the direction of the FBI and other U.S. authorities,"" the defence team claims.  ""In these circumstances, one would reasonably expect that the FBI was in communication with the [Department of Justice], the RCMP andu002For CBSA throughout these events ... Yet none of this material has been disclosed.""  A legal tangle  Monday's hearing will be the first time Meng has made a public appearance in months, guaranteeing a flock of media from around the world.  Her extradition hearing itself isn't slated to begin until January 2020. A separate hearing is also slated for next year to deal with the abuse of process allegations.    But a variety of legal proceedings have to play out before any of that can happen.  Adding to the legal complications, Meng is suing both the Canada Border Services Agency and the RCMP for allegedly violating her Charter rights during her initial arrest and detention.  The civil suit is a separate process to the extradition proceedings, but both will focus intense scrutiny on the events leading up to and including Meng's arrest — including the reason authorities allegedly made a last-minute decision to have CBSA officers detain Meng instead of arresting her either on the plane or as she disembarked.  Hearings in both cases are scheduled for Monday morning.  A 'ruse' to get information?  Meng's civil lawyers have interviewed Canadian officials at length as part of the discovery process and have told the court her extradition lawyers want to see those transcripts — which have not yet been entered into the record.  At a sparsely attended hearing a few weeks ago, Chief Justice Christopher Hinkson expressed some doubts about the motivation for the civil case.    ""I'm concerned that what's going on in this civil lawsuit is just a ruse to get information for the extradition proceedings,"" Hinkson told Meng's civil lawyers.  But Meng's civil lawyer, Howard Mickelson, claimed there was ""meat on the bones"" of the allegations that Meng's rights had been violated and that her two separate legal teams were not working together.  It's all likely to contribute to a day of unprecedented activity at the court.  'People are puzzled'  Meanwhile, the ripples from Meng's arrest continue to be felt in both Canada and China.  The Chinese government has blocked imports of canola seeds, pork and beef from Canada.  Two Canadians accused of drug trafficking in China have been sentenced to death.    And Canadians Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig remain in custody in China. The two men, who are accused of spying, were arrested within days of Meng's detention in Vancouver.  China has denied that any of these actions were taken in direct retaliation, but Chinese officials have made no secret of their displeasure with Canada's decision to assist the U.S. with Meng's extradition.  Paul Evans, a University of B.C. professor who is director emeritus of the Institute of Asian Research, says Meng's situation has captured the world's attention.  Evans says he's spoken with people across the country about the case and the underlying issues. Feelings are mixed, he says, but even the most tangled of court appearances will have the ability to spark debate.  ""People are puzzled about Meng, but they generally are divided on whether they're sympathetic to her, whether they see her caught in a vice knot of her own making, whether this has been sprung on us by the Americans,"" he says.  'Something that frightens'  Evans says the longer the case drags on, the more concern for Kovrig and Spavor will eclipse Meng's legal peril, especially considering the draconian conditions of their incarceration compared to Meng's gold-plated house arrest.  He says the case raises questions about the possibility of extradition being used as a tool for the United States to pursue a vendetta — questions at the heart of this week's proceedings.    Meng's extradition lawyers have argued that for years, U.S. officials ""have been stopping Huawei employees at U.S. ports of entry in order to gather evidence"" as part of an ""overall escalation in tactics"" against Huawei.  ""When we talk about who's breaking the rule of law, who's breaking international norms, this thing that the United States has done in going after Meng, is something that frightens the Chinese, it frightens people in Europe,"" Evans says.  ""If the United States is going to use extradition treaties to pull the chains on individuals who in this case are Chinese — is this something new?""",business
60,'Drastic actions' urged by UN agency as global average temperature rises higher,"The global average temperature is set to rise to at least 1.2 to 1.3 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels over the next five years, a World Meteorological Organization (WMO) official said on Monday, close to a limit adopted in a global treaty.  The prediction comes as governments are due to meet in New York for the UN Climate Action Summit to build on their pledges from the 2015 Paris Agreement, which aims to cap the global temperature rise at 1.5 degrees.  The agreement, adopted by almost 200 nations, set a goal of limiting warming to ""well below"" a rise of 2 C above pre-industrial times while ""pursuing efforts"" for the tougher 1.5 C goal.  A rise of 2 C is expected to wipe out more than 99 per cent of  coral reefs and melt most of the sea ice in the Arctic.  ""Basically we are on track to reach at least 1.2 to 1.3 degrees centigrade [above pre-industrial levels] over the next five years,"" Omar Baddour, WMO senior scientific officer, said in response to a Reuters question at a Geneva news conference.   ""It needs drastic actions,"" he added.    The comments came after the UN agency released a report on Sunday showing that the period from 2015 to 2019 was set to be the warmest five-year period on record, rising by 0.2 degrees Celsius over 2011-2015.  ""Not only are these statistics alarming they dispel any false sense of security that maybe we will muddle through this,"" said Maxx Dilley, director of the climate prediction and adaptation division of the WMO, told journalists.  ""There is going to have to be a dramatic scale up in the level of ambition and as well as in the level of actual follow through on the current policies that are intending to address this,"" he added.  The WMO report also showed record carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere recorded over the same period, with the pace of carbon dioxide growth up 20 per cent versus the last five-year assessment.  There is a lag in the period that the world's climate responds to carbon dioxide and other gasses, meaning that the emissions produced today can affect temperatures 20 years later, Dilley added, locking in the warming trend.",technology

62,Former Liberal MP Raj Grewal who left caucus over gambling addiction not running again,"Former Liberal MP Raj Grewal, who temporarily stepped away from federal politics last year to deal with a compulsive gambling problem, will not run in the upcoming federal election, CBC News has learned.  The Brampton East MP left the Liberal caucus last December, weeks after the Prime Minister's Office said he was receiving treatment from a health professional ""related to a gambling problem that led him to incur significant personal debts."" He sat as an Independent before Parliament was dissolved for the election.  The Globe and Mail reported at the time that Grewal had accumulated debt amounting to more than $1 million.  Grewal's debts and position as an MP — one who sat on the finance committee — prompted opposition politicians to question the government in the House of Commons about what it knew of Grewal's troubles and when.   ""We've learned that the gambling debts of the Liberal MP for Brampton East came to light as the result of a police wiretap,"" Conservative MP Mark Strahl said in November 2018, citing media reports.    ""The wiretaps were part of an OPP investigation into, quote, 'particularly shady guys' suspected of money laundering and terrorist financing. When did the Prime Minister's Office first learn about this serious investigation involving a sitting Liberal member of Parliament?""  NDP MP Nathan Cullen also grilled the government in the Commons, demanding answers about Grewal's time on the finance committee — especially the questions he asked senior RCMP witnesses about how they investigate money laundering.  ""The Liberal MP from Brampton East was appointed to the finance committee by the prime minister, where he asked troubling questions of senior law enforcement officials about how to avoid detection. This raised red flags with the RCMP,"" Cullen said.  Personal debts  CBC News reported that Grewal's most recent filing with the ethics commissioner's office at the time showed he had been carrying lines of credit with three separate banks: RBC, TD Bank and Scotiabank. He and another individual also held an HSBC mortgage.  His assets listed in the ethics filing included joint ownership of a residential investment property in Toronto.  That filing also showed Grewal had earned employment income from ZGemi Inc., a general contractor located in Brampton, and from the law firm Gahir &amp; Associates, on top of his MP's salary.  The ethics filing did not reveal the amounts owed on the lines of credit or the mortgage.  Grewal returning to legal practice  In early December, Grewal posted an 11-minute video to his Facebook page in which he addressed the allegations against him in the House of Commons and in a series of media reports.   The MP said he got into the habit of frequenting the Hilton hotel in Gatineau, Que., which houses the Lac-Leamy Casino.   What started as recreational blackjack spiraled into a ""significant problem,"" he said, as he accumulated gambling debts in high-stakes games over three years — debts he hid from his friends and family.   Grewal said he routinely borrowed from his loved ones to continue the pattern and no money was obtained illegally.    ""I want to make it clear, that every single personal loan made to me was by cheque. Everybody has been paid back, and every loan and repayment is transparent and traceable,"" he said in the video.  He said his problem gambling was hidden until early November, when he revealed his addiction to his family. Shortly after that, on Nov. 19, Grewal said he notified Trudeau's office about his mental-health issues.  Planned to resign and changed his mind  The PMO and Grewal initially said he would resign his seat.  ""Based on these circumstances, we agreed that his decision to resign as member of Parliament for Brampton East was the right one,"" the PMO statement said at the time. ""We hope he receives the support he needs.""  However, by the end of January this year he changed his mind and announced he would stay on as an Independent MP.   Grewal told CBC News Wednesday that he decided to serve out his term because that's what he promised his constituents. He said he is grateful for the support voters have shown him and will return to his private legal practice in Brampton after the election.",politics
63,Eco-anxiety spurs youth to take action on climate change,"This story is part of a CBC News series titled In Our Backyard, which looks at the effects climate change is having in Canada, from extreme weather events to how it's reshaping our economy.    Emma Lim, 18, announced this week that she's not going to have children until governments take serious action on climate change. The movement she launched spurred thousands more across Canada  to make a similar promise called the No Future pledge.   ""My generation is facing a future of economic instability, food scarcity, extreme weather events, and we, the children, are desperate,"" the McGill University student  said at a news conference in Ottawa on Monday.  Lim and other young people around the world are trying to get their voices heard. Led by the actions of 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg, thousands took to the streets on Friday with demonstrations across the globe — a precursor to the UN Youth Climate Summit starting in New York on Saturday.  With fires, floods, and pollution growing faster and more serious every year, children and young people are scared that they'll be bearing the brunt of this crisis. It's spawning a condition called eco-anxiety, a fear of environmental catastrophe. And while it's not officially recognized as a medical diagnosis, some experts say it's a real phenomenon.    ""The issues of the changing climate are reaching a sense of emergency as well as urgency,"" said Dr. Irena Buka, clinical professor of pediatrics at the University of Alberta.  She recently co-authored a position statement from the Canadian Paediatric Society on global climate change and Canadian children's health.  It listed for doctors a number of climate-related threats to children and their bodies. They included:     Heat and cold related deaths.   Air pollution.   Contaminated water.   Infections.    ""Now we have to start thinking about infections that don't normally reside or affect children in our region. We have to start thinking of things that we think existed only in warmer, tropical climates,"" Buka said.  In Oyster Bed, P.E.I., just outside of Charlottetown, university student Paige Martin is all too aware of the impact climate change may have on her community.  ""Sometimes you hear on the Island that the Island will be under water if we don't change our ways because we are such a small island and we are surrounded by water.""  Martin, her friends and her family are trying to do their part. Last spring,she founded a non-profit organization called Green Everlasting P.E.I. The group leads roadside cleanups, tree plantings, and tries to educate Islanders about what they can do to stop climate change.    ""It makes me feel a lot better because I don't feel like I'm doing nothing. I feel like I'm taking a step forward. I'm taking action,"" she said.  That sense of control is important to combat a sense of helplessness, according to Prof. Julia Woodhall-Melnik, a professor of sociology at the University of New Brunswick in Saint John.  She studied the mental health impact of two years of extreme flooding that hit the province starting in 2018, which was considered one of the worst years for flooding in recent memory.  Action alleviates anxiety  ""There was a lot of anxiety, a lot of stress. People were mentally and physically exhausted,"" she said.  Woodhall-Melnik said it rubbed off on the children, but many of them turned that anxiety into action, something she called ""post-traumatic growth.""  ""There were a lot of kids who really wanted to get out and help their communities. There were instances of moms taking their very young children, five, six, years old and bringing them to sandbag for their neighbours. So exposing them to community that way has a positive impact on well-being and community growth,"" she said.    Woodhall-Melnik applauds the position statement of the Canadian Paediatric Society.  ""If our youth are worrying or experiencing these extreme forms of anxiety we need to make sure that medical professionals, public health officers, even teachers are well equipped to step in and intervene, recognize the mental health concerns, and help them deal with it in a realistic way,"" she said.  Members of Lim's group, Climate Strike Canada, are hoping their pledge of not bringing more children into the world serves as a poignant wake-up call for action. Her mother, Catherine Cartman, a former lawyer who worked within the oil and gas industry, is still hoping that one day she will become a grandmother. But she understands her daughter's decision.  ""It is heartbreaking and horrifying to see our kids worry about something that until now we just took for granted,"" she said. ""We cannot let our children shoulder this burden alone.""",technology
64,"GM's Oshawa truck assembly line shut down, workers told to stay home as parts run short","Hundreds of GM workers in Oshawa were told to stay home Wednesday after a strike by auto workers in the U.S. limited the number of parts shipped to Canada, shutting down the truck assembly line at the plant.  Approximately 49,000 United Auto Workers in the U.S. went on strike against General Motors on Sunday night.     On Tuesday afternoon, 1,200 workers in Oshawa were told to go home. Another 650 workers on the morning shift were told they weren't needed on Wednesday.  A spokesperson for GM said approximately half of the production at the Oshawa plant was being affected by the UAW strike.  ""Some vehicles have been disrupted because of a lack of parts,"" David Paterson, GM's vice-president for corporate and environmental affairs, confirmed, explaining the company will continue to monitor the situation.  'They have to pay us regardless'  The Oshawa assembly plant is one of five North American plants closing at the end of the year. That means the workers sent home or told to stay away will be paid a full wage because of a contract stipulating all full-time employees must be paid for the last 16 weeks of work.  ""This affected GM more than it affected us — we're already prepared for the plant closure, and now because of the contract they have to pay us regardless,"" Peter Levesque, who opted to go home on Wednesday morning, told CBC News.     Unifor Local 222 union representative Mike Barry said his main concern is keeping everyone inside the Oshawa plant happy for now.  ""Our union has gone through great lengths with the company to make sure this isn't affecting us financially right now,"" Barry said.  ""We're just standing behind our brothers in the States — they've got a big fight ahead of them, but they can do it,"" he added.    Both the union and GM are watching two other plants in Ontario closely, but so far the assembly plant in Ingersoll and the engine and transmission plant in St. Catharines have been unaffected by the parts shortage.  However, Jerry Dias, president of Canadian union Unifor, said workers in St. Catharines could face layoffs within days, since about 80 per cent of the engines the plant builds are destined for cars assembled in the U.S.  At the Ingersoll assembly plant, about half the engines they put in cars come from the U.S. Dias estimates they may have to halt operations within 10 days.  GM has not said how many days of parts it has in reserve.",business
65,Sask. Ministry of Health watching for vaping-related illness,"The Saskatchewan Ministry of Health is now monitoring intensive care units across the province for vaping-related illness, but says there have been no cases in the province so far.  ""I am concerned with the recent incidents of vaping related illnesses, as well as the high rates of vaping we are seeing among Saskatchewan youth,"" Saskatchewan Health Minister Jim Reiter said in a release Friday.  ""Earlier this week I directed Saskatchewan public health officials to monitor all cases as they present in intensive care units.""  Any medical staff who encounter a severe respiratory episode that may be due to vaping are to report the incident immediately.  The move comes as vaping has been under scrutiny both in Canada and beyond. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had reported 530 confirmed and probable cases of lung injury related to e-cigarettes as of Sept. 17, including at least seven deaths.   An eighth death was reported by U.S. media outlets on Thursday.  Dr. Saqib Shahab of the Saskatchewan Health Authority said the question of whether vaping-related illnesses were passed off as something else is being explored in the United States.  ""There's two ways of looking at it: one is that vaping overall is a relatively recent phenomenon; over the last two to three years is when it's really picked up,"" he said.   ""Secondly the fact that many people have added cannabis products to vaping may also be something that's been happening.… That's also another line of inquiry that's going on in the U.S.""  Shahab said in many cases people admitted to hospital were using unregulated or tampered vaping devices.  He said a reporting process will be in place until medical professionals in Canada and the United States have a better understanding of the underlying risk factors.  Shahab said there's no reason for someone who's not already a smoker to take up vaping and cautioned against doing so.  This week, officials in Ontario said a teenager was put on life support after using a vaping device, in what public health officials say is the first reported case of illness linked to the practice in Canada.  And India banned e-cigarettes on Wednesday, saying the move was intended to ensure there was no ""vaping"" epidemic in the country.    Health Canada has issued a directive to health-care professionals here, telling them to ask patients about their vaping use and if they have any trouble breathing or shortness of breath.  In his Friday release, Reiter encouraged parents to talk with children about the potential risks associated with vaping.  According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, here are some symptoms to watch for if you, or someone you know, is vaping:     Breathing difficulty.   Shortness of breath.   Chest pain before hospitalization.   Mild to moderate gastrointestinal illness including vomiting and diarrhea.   Other symptoms such as fevers or fatigue.",health
66,Diabetes drug victims demand justice in French trial,"Victims of a diabetes drug suspected in hundreds of deaths pleaded for justice as a massive trial involving more than 4,000 plaintiffs opened Monday for French pharmaceutical giant Servier Laboratoires and France's medicines watchdog.  The company and the oversight body stand accused of involuntary manslaughter, fraud and other charges in their handling of the drug Mediator.  ""My life is just not the same,"" said Paquita Guardiola, who suffered severe health complications requiring a heart transplant after taking the drug. ""Now it's hard for me to even get dressed. My children dress me, my husband dresses me. He helps me in the shower, he does everything.""  Although marketed as a diabetes drug, Mediator was also prescribed as a hunger suppressant and was taken by millions of people before sales were suspended in France in 2009.  A 2010 study said Mediator was suspected in 1,000-2,000 deaths, with doctors linking it to heart and lung problems.    The drug has never been reviewed or approved for use in Canada, Health Canada said in a statement to CBC News.  The closely watched trial that opened in Paris is expected to last six months and is one of France's biggest in years.  The trial dossier runs to nearly 700 pages — with around 300 pages taken up by plaintiffs' names. The trial was spread across five rooms, connected by video-link, at the Paris courthouse. Nearly 400 lawyers were working on the case.  Guardiola, who has already received compensation from Servier, will testify as a witness. She said the drugmaker ""ruined my life.""  Irene Frachon, a lung specialist who was among the first in France to sound the alarm about Mediator, said the scandal could not be simply brushed aside.    ""You can't 'Put it behind you' when 2,000 people died,"" she said. ""I'm really counting on this criminal case to put an end to this collective blindness to white collar crimes, especially with regards to what I call pharma-criminality.""  She added: ""Whatever the financial stakes, there are red lines that need to be redrawn and that's why this trial is crucial.""    Investigating magistrates concluded that Servier for decades covered up Mediator's harmful effects on patients. The national medicines agency is suspected of colluding in masking its dangers.  Francois de Castro, a lawyer for Servier, said the pharmaceutical firm wasn't aware of risks associated with Mediator before 2009 — 33 years after it first went on sale.  Company faces manslaughter and fraud charges   Speaking at the courthouse, the president of Servier, Olivier Laureau, expressed ""our deepest and sincerest regrets"" to ""the patients who have suffered from Mediator"" and ""to their families who have gone through a tragedy.""  Servier is being tried on charges of manslaughter, unintentional harm, fraud and deceit about the chemical makeup of Mediator and the risks of taking it.    France's medicines agency, meanwhile reformed and renamed, is also accused of manslaughter by negligence and causing unintentional harm.  Also on trial are 12 representatives of the pharma giant and the medicines agency.  ""This trial is a victory for the victims,"" said Dominique-Michel Courtois, head of a Mediator victims group. He said they want answers on how Servier obtained a license to market the drug and how it ""hoodwinked the authorities.""  Headquartered in a suburb of Paris, Servier employs 22,000 people worldwide.  With files from CBC News",health
67,"We've lost 3 billion birds since 1970, study shows","There are nearly three billion fewer birds in Canada and the United States than there were half a century ago, a new study estimates.  It counted a loss of 2.9 billion birds compared with 1970, which represents a population decline of 29 per cent and an ""overlooked biodiversity crisis,"" said the report published Thursday in the journal Science.  ""I was stunned,"" said Ken Rosenberg, the lead author. ""I couldn't believe that there was that magnitude of a net change.""  Rosenberg is a conservation scientist at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the American Bird Conservancy.   His study with Canadian and U.S. collaborators combined population data from more than 500 species going back half a century. It also includes a decade of weather radar data that measures the mass of migrating birds, and found a 14 per cent decline over that time.    The study found that the vast majority of the birds that have disappeared aren't rare or vulnerable endangered species, but include many familiar backyard birds like sparrows, juncos, and starlings considered common and abundant.  ""That is what is such a strong indicator that something is wrong in these habitats and environments,"" Rosenberg said. ""This loss of abundance is so pervasive that it's the old canary in a coal mine — it's almost certainly an indicator of a degradation of overall environmental quality that's ultimately going to affect people.""  The study noted that birds provide important benefits to ecosystems, such as pest control, pollination and seed dispersal, and warned that common birds may be disproportionately important parts of the food web and local ecosystems.  Previous reports, such as the State of Canada's Birds earlier this year, showed that some groups of birds, including grassland birds and shorebirds such as plovers and sandpipers, have declining populations. A report on the State of North America's birds in 2016 had even estimated that bird populations had declined by a billion since 1970.   Andrew Couturier, a senior director with Bird Studies Canada, one of the groups that produced those reports, said those reports were based on relative population changes rather than actual counts. He's confident in the improved estimate based on improved and refined data and methods, which Bird Studies Canada was not involved in.  Couturier called the new estimate ""shocking"" but says it matches up with what many people have reported anecdotally: ""This is kind of confirming what we've noticed.""   Previous studies also showed that some groups of birds, such as waterfowl and birds of prey, were increasing, largely due to conservation measures.    Rosenberg thought an actual count of bird populations in North America over time might show growing populations for some species partly compensating for population losses among declining species, many of which are rare to begin with.  To his surprise, that wasn't the case. The new study showed even birds such as house sparrows and starlings, which were introduced from Europe, do well in cities, and have typically out-competed native birds, are disappearing — their populations are down 331 million and 83 million, respectively, since 1970.      People love birds. There's an army of people out there who love to go out and do these surveys and count birds.  - Ken Rosenberg, lead author     Rosenberg said even backyard birds that aren't choosy about their habitats can be affected by degradation such as intensifying agriculture, urban sprawl, and fragmentation of forests. They also face other human-caused threats, such as increased pesticide use, domestic cats, and collisions with windows.   ""It's what we call death by a thousand cuts,"" Rosenberg said.  The report found native sparrows, warblers and blackbirds have seen some of the biggest population declines, in the hundreds of millions of individuals.    Paul Smith, a research scientist with Environment and Climate Change Canada who co-authored the paper, said those aren't necessarily the most worrying declines: ""They're just the largest in magnitude, because those species started with large population sizes.""  Birds that migrate long distances, such as those shorebirds that Smith studies and many of those that breed in Canada's Arctic or boreal forest but spend winters in Central and South America, have been particularly hard hit. Migrating species declined by 2.5 billion individuals, faring much worse than those that stay put year round, that increased slightly, by 26 million.  ""Canada, and in particular Arctic Canada, is the breeding range for a lot of North America's shorebirds. So really Canada has a huge responsibility for the conservation of these birds.""    The study points out that conservation has brought back populations of waterfowl.  ""What we've found,"" said Smith, ""is when we've put our mind to it, we've been able to recover species.""  That said, Couturier noted that 80 per cent of Canada's birds spend part of the year outside the country, meaning that we need to work with partners in the U.S., Mexico and Central and South America.   Beyond birds  Birds are particularly good indicators of ecosystem health as they are easier to monitor than another other group of animals, the researchers note. They're active during the day, and are conspicuous, making it possible for people to both see and hear them, Rosenberg said, unlike many insects, lizards or mammals.  The population estimates in the study largely made use of data collected by volunteers or ""citizen scientists"" during standardized annual surveys, especially the Breeding Bird Survey, which has been running since 1966, coordinated by Environment and Climate Change Canada's Canadian Wildlife Service, the U.S. Geological Survey, and Mexico's National Commission for Knowledge and the Use of Biodiversity.    ""People love birds,"" Rosenberg said. ""There's an army of people out there who love to go out and do these surveys and count birds.""  Bridget Stutchbury, a York University professor of conservation biology and ecology who studies migratory songbirds in North America but was not involved in the study, called the results ""alarming.""   ""This is the first ever 'big picture' of overall bird losses, and it uses two independent data sets to make the case that we are still in the midst of a bird decline crisis,"" she said in an email.  However, she noted the study wasn't designed to address the root causes.  ""So while it is a call to arms, it's a bit unclear what new or stronger direction we should take as a society.""  The researchers and the bird conservation and research groups they belong to do offer suggestions for individual and policy actions that could help through their website 3billionbirds.org.    A UN report earlier this year found not just birds are in decline: one million species of plants and animals are at risk of extinction, half of them due to ""insufficient habitat for long-term survival."" Kai Chan, a professor at the Institute for Resources, Environment and Sustainability at the University of British Columbia who co-authored the report, said the new study had more precise population estimates for birds.  And while it doesn't directly say anything about the decline in other species, what is bad for birds is often bad for other animals, and some of the bird declines may be reflecting the decline in prey species such as insects.  ""It further confirms what we already know,"" he said in an email. ""The big picture is very concerning.""    Other studies have looked at recent declines in groups such as amphibians and insects. One recent report showed that many bumblebee species are declining in Canada.Victoria MacPhail, a bee specialist at York University and lead author of that report, said she was ""equal parts shocked and not all that surprised"" by the bird population decline.  She said monitoring populations of animals needs to continue, and the public can help by participating in citizen science.  ""But we also need to take action on the ground with increased conservation efforts and behaviour changes and in the halls of government, with changes in policy and regulations and even an increase in funding support: simply lamenting the loss of our biodiversity will not cause anything to change.""",technology
68,Banks tell dozens of customers they're to blame for thousands of dollars lost to e-transfer fraudsters,"A Manitoba man says marketing that claims people are protected when they e-transfer money is misleading, after fraudsters stole $3,000 and TD Bank said he was to blame.  Rene Trudeau e-transferred the maximum his bank allowed — $3,000 — to a contractor who installed a new front door on his home in February. He then e-transferred the remaining $300 owed and texted the contractor to let him know he'd been paid in full.   The contractor texted back, saying he didn't get the e-transfers and hadn't seen a dime.  ""I kind of panic,"" Trudeau told Go Public from his home in Île-des-Chênes, just outside Winnipeg. ""Because at this point, all $3,300 is gone from my account.""  Trudeau is one of dozens of people who contacted Go Public after a recent story about e-transfer fraud — all describing frustrating battles with their banks and questioning why exemptions that leave them on the hook when fraudsters strike are buried in the fine print of electronic banking agreements.      Been wronged and you're not the only one affected? Contact the Go Public team     A police detective with Toronto's cybercrime unit says because e-transfer fraud is on the rise, financial institutions need to do a better job of informing customers about risks and how they can better protect themselves.  ""They [banks] want to be good corporate citizens,"" said Det. Const. Kenrick Bagnall. ""They should … be more proactive.""  As soon as Trudeau realized something was wrong, he contacted TD Bank and an employee was able to stop the $300 e-transfer from leaving his account. But the earlier $3,000 was gone.  That was the beginning of a seven-month battle with TD, to try to track his money and get it back.  ""When I asked where the money went, or how did this happen, they seemed more interested in absolving themselves of the responsibility for this fraud,"" said Trudeau. ""Customer service was atrocious.""  He says it took three weeks before someone in TD's Customer Care department told him his money had been redirected to another chartered bank — which TD wouldn't name — and more than 10 weeks for TD to provide the RCMP with the financial information necessary to investigate.    Protection requirements in fine print  TD said the fraud occurred after a someone hacked into the contractor's email and correctly answered Trudeau's security question, which was ""What is your wife's name?""   Because it wasn't hard for the fraudster to figure out the answer — the contractor named his wife on his Facebook page — TD said Trudeau was to blame, pointing to a clause on page four of the bank's electronic financial terms and conditions.  The agreement is similar to those in place at all the big banks and says customers must use tough security questions with answers only the sender and recipient can guess.       The system is not as secure as they say.  — Rene Trudeau, e-transfer fraud victim     Trudeau admits his security question was weak, but says TD's marketing claims that customers who use e-transfer are ""protected"" and their money is ""secure,"" so it hadn't occurred to him that fraudsters could hack emails and redirect an e-transfer.  ""They [banks] should be acknowledging that the system is not as secure as they say it is,"" Trudeau said.   Most customers not reimbursed  Dozens of other people have recently contacted Go Public, describing how they, too, felt misled by their financial institutions after fraudsters diverted their e-transfer funds.   They point to how financial institutions market the convenience of e-transfers and make claims in bold print that the system is safe.     In smaller print — or, buried in online agreements — banks and credit unions outline a list of requirements a customer must meet in order to actually be protected, should something happen to their money.   ""They don't want to scare people away from using the service — which has a significant payoff for them,"" said Trudeau. ""It's quite frustrating.""  All told, Go Public has learned about fraudsters using e-transfer to steal almost $64,000 from 56 people with accounts at TD, CIBC, Royal Bank, Scotiabank, Tangerine, Simplii, HSBC, Assiniboine Credit Union and Kawartha Credit Union.   Customers did not get their money back in almost three-quarters of the cases:     Neil Joshi, a Toronto teacher, lost $2,790 after he e-transferred a payment to his HVAC contractor, but it was intercepted by a fraudster. Neither his nor the intended recipient's bank will reimburse the stolen funds. ""What I find remarkable is that none of these banks seem to be taking any measures to address this type of security issue,"" wrote Joshi to Go Public. ""Their attitude was, 'As long as we're not on the hook for the funds … it's not our problem.'""   Tim Smith of Fort St. John, B.C., wrote to say that he lost over $5,300 after his e-transfer to his carpenter was intercepted, and his bank blamed weak email security. ""They [banks] hold immense amounts of money in trust for the public and if their protocol is no better than that, they don't deserve to be in business.""   Contractor Jeff Harney of North Vancouver was supposed to receive a $1,500 e-transfer from a client, but his email was hacked and his bank refused to compensate for the loss. ""My disappointment with the system is that the BIG PRINT says ZERO LIABILITY and RISK-FREE but the small print negates them of all responsibility,"" he wrote.    Watch: Are e-transfers a safe way to send money?     Banks require gag orders  After Go Public contacted TD Bank earlier this month about Trudeau, the bank reached out to him again.   Trudeau says they have now come to a ""satisfactory agreement,"" but he's not allowed to share details, because TD required him to sign a confidentiality agreement.  TD declined to address Go Public's questions about where Trudeau's $3,000 e-transfer went, or why it took seven months to resolve the problem.   In an emailed statement to Go Public, TD's manager of corporate and public affairs Carla Hindman wrote: ""We have co-operated with the police investigation and have resolved this concern with our customer.""      After Go Public contacted TD Bank about Trudeau's complaint, the bank published tips on preventing e-transfer fraud    In another e-transfer dispute, CIBC required a gag order before offering customer Charlotte Mustard $1,000 as a ""gesture of goodwill"" after $3,000 she transferred to pay for a new furnace in her Peterborough, Ont., home was stolen.  ""That is the part that really got me,"" says Mustard. ""It was like they [CIBC] were saying, 'Here, take this money and go away and be quiet and don't bother us anymore.' Where's the goodwill in that? And where is the justice?""  She refused to sign the confidentiality agreement and contacted Go Public. ""It's very important for me to be heard — as a woman, as a senior. And I was not heard by the CIBC at all. As a matter of fact, I felt very, very discounted.""  CIBC's senior consultant for public affairs, Crystal Jongeward, told Go Public in an email, ""We're continuing to work with the bank that received the funds to resolve the matter for our client."" The theft occurred last January.  Frauds reported 'tip of the iceberg'  Go Public requested an interview with the Canadian Bankers Association (CBA) to discuss why banks don't do more to educate customers about the importance of strong email security to protect against e-transfer fraud.   CBA spokesperson Mathieu Labrèche declined to be interviewed but said in a statement that banks widely publish information and tips about scams and provide electronic access agreements ""wherein customers commit to using passwords and security questions that are unique and cannot be easily guessed or obtained by others.""    Bagnall, the Toronto detective, says Canada's banks need to do much more to warn customers about potential risks when using e-transfers, because the frauds being reported are ""the tip of the iceberg.""  He said financial institutions may not be reporting fraud because it can cause ""reputational harm.""  ""If customers start leaving … that could very much affect their business,"" said Bagnall. ""Damage to the brand is a huge reason why organizations are not reporting cybercrime to the police.""  Bagnall says there's also no requirement for the banks to report e-transfer crime to the police.    ""They're so large that there's not really a reason that they need to be transparent, because they can do their own internal investigations,"" he said. ""They really only need to report to the privacy commissioner.""  Trudeau says the battle with his bank was exhausting, frustrating and has changed his online banking habits.  He says he'll never again e-transfer a large amount of money — $20 is now his limit.       Submit your story ideas   Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

69,Scientists sound alarm over Alberta's new approach to tracking oilsands pollution,"The scientist who once oversaw the science division of an independent agency keeping tabs on the impact of industrial pollution in Alberta is leaving the province and speaking out about the politics that he says has come to permeate Alberta's petroleum-based economy.  Bill Donahue says he fears the quality and depth of environmental monitoring in the province will continue to decline, imperilling the public's understanding of potentially harmful pollutants produced by the oilsands and related industries.  Last week, staff at Alberta Environment and Parks were informed that the Environmental Monitoring and Science Division (EMSD), which Donahue once helped lead, was being dissolved and rolled into a new structure. A stand-alone climate change office will also disappear.  ""In my experience, it'll result in significant disruption of programs. Possibly more cuts in budgets. Lack of focus. Fractured scientific leadership. That sort of thing,""  Donahue said in an interview with CBC News.  ""If you don't have adequate or appropriate monitoring, you won't ever be able to tell whether your decisions are effective, whether policies are achieving their goals.""    Donahue said environmental monitoring in Alberta had already been weakened under the previous NDP government, which eliminated the independent Alberta Environmental Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting Agency (AEMERA). Donahue, who has a scientific and legal background, was also vice-president and chief monitoring officer at AEMERA.  Failure to properly monitor led to global scrutiny  The province was pushed into establishing an independent agency in 2014 after a team led by University of Alberta scientist David Schindler found that pollution from the oilsands was not being properly detected, leading to widespread criticism from environmental organizations.  Schindler, now retired, said that as the oilsands were being developed in the 1970s and '80s, Progressive Conservative governments constantly reassured the public that there was no problem with pollution. When he and a group of scientists conducted their own independent research, they found that government monitoring had been ineffective and politically influenced.  ""The problem in the past has been that the political thumb has been on the science, ensuring that there was never adequate science done,"" he said.   The new structure that has government overseeing monitoring threatens to tip the scale back to the past, Schindler said.  ""Anything that could possibly be wrong in the oilsands is now subject to political censorship, so that the public at large will not know whether what they're hearing is straight propaganda or the truth.""      Oilsands monitoring needs scientific rigour: panel   Alberta, Canada launch joint oilsands monitoring system   Environment minister defends dismantling arm's-length industry monitor    Because Alberta's economy is so dependent on oil, governments of all political brands have been boosters of the industry. Premier Jason Kenney, elected last April, is currently in the U.S. trying to attract new investment in the province's oil business.  A key part of his messaging is that Alberta produces the cleanest, most ethical heavy oil in the world. Among Kenney's first moves as premier was to establish a ""war room"" to challenge news stories and battle critics of the industry. He's also set up a $2.5-million public inquiry to investigate foreign funding of groups opposing the oilsands.    Donahue said he finds it telling that the Kenney government is spending more on battling opposition to the oilsands than it is on monitoring its environmental impacts.  ""I guess that tells me where the priority of monitoring and science is,"" he said. ""If you put more money into attacking environmentalists and, you know, chasing these conspiracy theories and probably disinforming and misinforming the public than you do putting it into programs that actually reveal whether or not there are actually significant problems, that needs to be addressed or mitigated.""  Alberta Environment Minister Jason Nixon was unavailable for comment. But in a statement sent to CBC News, his department said the reorganization will make oilsands monitoring more effective.  The new division ""will allow for increased collaboration and capacity among scientists working on fish and wildlife, environmental monitoring and science, flood forecasting, cumulative effects modelling and other areas,"" it said.  The Alberta government says it has no intention of reducing the amount it spends on monitoring, which was about $20.4 million last year under the EMSD. The federal government and the oilsands industry also contribute to monitoring",technology
70,"Trump administration, California headed for pitched battle on auto mileage standards","President Donald Trump announced Wednesday that his administration is revoking California's authority to set auto mileage standards stricter than those issued by federal regulators.  In a tweet, Trump said his move would result in less expensive and safer cars. He insisted that new cars would be cleaner, even as they burn more gasoline than they would have under the Obama-era fuel efficiency standards.  ""Many more cars will be produced under the new and uniform standard, meaning significantly more JOBS, JOBS, JOBS! Automakers should seize this opportunity because without this alternative to California, you will be out of business,"" Trump tweeted, a claim that Gavin Newsom, California's Democratic governor, quickly pushed back against.  Trump's move comes after the Justice Department opened an antitrust investigation into a deal between California and four automakers for tougher pollution and related mileage requirements than those sought by Trump. Trump also has sought to relax federal mileage standards nationwide, weakening a key effort by his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama to slow climate change.  California, in addition to environmental groups, vowed to fight the latest plans from Washington through the courts.      We cannot afford to backslide in our battle against climate change.  - Xavier Becerra, California's attorney general     ""We cannot afford to backslide in our battle against climate change,"" said Xavier Becerra, the state's attorney general, at a news conference.  ""We have the law, facts and science on our side,"" added Newsom, at the same news briefing.    U.S. automakers contend that without a substantial increase in fuel efficiency, their vehicles will be less competitive globally, which could potentially result in job losses.  ""Automakers support year-over-year increases in fuel economy standards that align with marketplace realities, and we support one national program as the best path to preserve good auto jobs, keep new vehicles affordable for more Americans and avoid a marketplace with different standards,"" said Dave Schwietert, the interim CEO and president of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which represents Ford, General Motors and other leading U.S. automakers.  Emissions standards are closely linked with fuel economy requirements because vehicles pollute less if they burn fewer gallons of fuel.    Mary Nichols, chair of the California Air Resources Board, said the Trump administration move flies in the face of an industry increasingly investing in electric vehicles.  ""This is the fight of a lifetime for us — we have to win this, and I think we will,"" she said.      It's about the oil industry, period. Full stop.  - California Gov. Gavin Newsom     Nichols and Newsom both noted how the Republicans are usually vociferous in their support of state's rights.  ""I don't know what the hell's happening to the Republican Party,"" said Newsom.  EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler told the National Automobile Dealers Association on Tuesday the agency's goal is to establish one nationwide set of fuel-economy standards.  ""We embrace federalism and the role of the states, but federalism does not mean that one state can dictate standards for the nation,"" Wheeler said, adding that higher fuel economy standards would hurt consumers by increasing the average sticker price of new cars and requiring automakers to produce more electric vehicles.  Waivers never rejected, California says  California's authority to set its own tougher emissions standards goes back to a waiver issued by Congress during passage of the Clean Air Act in 1970, under the administration of Republican Richard Nixon. The state has long pushed automakers to adopt more fuel-efficient passenger vehicles that emit less pollution. A dozen states and the District of Columbia also follow California's fuel economy standards.  Becerra noted the unprecedented nature of the fight since that time, even as Democratic governors such as Jerry Brown and Gray Davis served while Republican administrations were in power in Washington.  ""We have been granted 100 waivers. Never has one been rejected,"" he said.  Newsom, admitting his ""deep frustration,"" cited the support from the auto industry and accused the administration of kowtowing to special interests.  ""It's about the oil industry, period. Full stop,"" he said, noting the opposition of oil companies through the years to the waiver granted to California.  The deal struck in July between California and four of the world's largest automakers — Ford, Honda, BMW and Volkswagen — bypassed the Trump administration's plan to freeze emissions and fuel economy standards adopted under Obama at 2021 levels.  The four automakers agreed with California to reduce emissions by 3.7 per cent per year starting with the 2022 model year, through 2026. That compares with 4.7 per cent yearly reductions through 2025 under the Obama standards.    It's not clear yet what the Trump administration will propose as its final fuel-efficiency rules, but in the past it has favoured freezing Obama-era mileage standards at 2021 levels. Under the Obama administration requirements, the fleet of new vehicles would have to average 30 miles per gallon (13 kilometres per litre) in real-world driving by 2021, rising to 36 mpg (15.3 kmu002FL) in 2025. Currently the standard is 26 mpg (11 kmu002FL).  The U.S. transportation sector is the nation's biggest single source of planet-warming greenhouse gases. Becerra said in California, transportation use accounts for 29 per cent of the greenhouse gas total.  The EPA's Wheeler said Tuesday: ""California will be able to keep in place and enforce programs to address smog and other forms of air pollution caused by motor vehicles."" But fuel economy has been one of the key regulatory tools the state has used to reduce harmful emissions.  Environmentalists condemned the Trump administration's move, which comes as gasoline prices have crept higher following a weekend drone attack that hobbled Saudi Arabian oil output.  ""Everyone wins when we adopt strong clean car standards as our public policy,"" said Fred Krupp, president of Environmental Defence Fund. ""Strong clean car standards give us healthier air to breathe, help protect us from the urgent threat of climate change and save Americans hundreds of dollars a year in gas expenses.""  Under Trump, the EPA contends that freezing the fuel economy standards will reduce the average sticker price of new vehicles by about $2,700 US by 2025, though that predicted savings is disputed by environmental groups and is more than double the EPA estimates from the prior administration.  Trump's tweet does not address the money consumers would save at the gas pump if cars got better mileage. A study released by Consumer Reports in August found that the owner of a 2026 vehicle will pay over $3,300 more for gasoline during the life of a vehicle if the standards are frozen at 2021 levels.  Trump's announcement on Wednesday came about an hour after after an Environmental Protection Agency spokesperson said, when asked about the subject by The Associated Press, ""We have nothing to announce at this time.""",technology
71,Vancouver mayor calls on federal leaders to act on overdose crisis,"The mayor of Vancouver says the city that opened North America's first supervised injection site following a surge in heroin-related deaths wants all federal party leaders to consider a proposal to allow substance users access to pharmaceutical-grade heroin.  Kennedy Stewart is aiming for a Health Canada exemption from federal drug laws so diacetylmorphine, a safe substitute opioid, could be distributed through a non-profit organization to prevent overdose deaths from potentially dangerous drugs laced with fentanyl.  ""We have thousands of addicts in this city and I think the scale of the problem just isn't understood,"" he said in a recent interview.  Stewart said he has had informal talks with three of the four major party leaders: Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau, the NDP's Jagmeet Singh, and Green Leader Elizabeth May. He has tried to set up a meeting with Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer.    Insite, a Vancouver facility where people shoot up their own substances under medical supervision, opened in 2003 with an exemption from drug laws by the Liberal government after intense lobbying by health officials, drug users, and local and provincial politicians.  The Conservative government led by Stephen Harper vigorously opposed the site, saying it fostered addiction. The Tories fought to shut it down before losing a Supreme Court of Canada battle in 2011.    Since then, eight more supervised injection sites have opened in British Columbia. Alberta now has eight sites, Ontario is home to 22 and Quebec has opened four of them, all in Montreal, says Health Canada, which is considering four more applications from Ontario, two from Alberta and one each from Saskatchewan and Manitoba.  'Extremely dangerous substances'  Scheer's press secretary, Daniel Schow, said the Conservative party does not support supervised injection sites, safer opioids or decriminalization.  ""It is tragic that we have failed these Canadians to the point where drug injection sites are often the only focus of discussion instead of a comprehensive approach to addiction,"" Schow said in a statement.  ""Drugs such as heroin, crack cocaine, and meth are extremely dangerous substances that tear families apart and have lasting effects on individuals who choose to consume them.""  Singh said on the second day of the election campaign that people struggling with addiction should get health care for a chronic condition and not be criminalized if their drugs are for personal use.    ""Thousands of Canadians are dying and we've got to do things differently,"" he said during a stop in Brampton, Ont., adding that mental health issues must also be treated.  ""We can't continue down the same path. If we want to change the results we've got to change our approach.""  May also stressed the need to address the opioid crisis as a health-care issue and called for the declaration of a national health emergency.    ""Drug possession should be decriminalized, ensuring people have access to a screened supply and the medical support they need to combat their addiction,"" she said in a statement.  Trudeau has said no to decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of drugs for personal use.  'This is exactly what we need'  Data from the BC Coroners Service show that between 2016 and June 2019, over a quarter of the 4,559 overdose deaths in British Columbia occurred in Vancouver, the city hit hardest in Canada by the opioid epidemic. Statistics by the Public Health Agency in June showed 11,577 people died across the country from opioid-related overdoses between June 2016 and December 2018.  Stewart said providing a safer supply of drugs to people who are struggling with addiction is an innovative and practical response to the overdose crisis.  He said he isn't pursuing decriminalization as an option because it's a toxic drug supply that's killing people.    ""I don't need that kind of massive policy change to reduce overdoses here in the city. What I need is a federal health exemption. That's it,"" he said.  Dr. Keith Ahamad, an addiction specialist at St. Paul's Hospital in downtown Vancouver, wants illegal drugs to be regulated.  ""(Trudeau) has previously used that exact argument for creating a regulatory framework for cannabis in Canada and this is exactly what we need to do for other substances.""    Reducing stigma  Decriminalization is also important in reducing stigma against drug users so they don't fear getting help for their addiction and should include education, social supports and treatment through the health-care system, which has made Portugal's decriminalization model a success, Ahamad said.  ""In Canada we have a system right now where the vast majority of addiction care is being provided by unskilled and sometimes lay people. It's not regulated,"" he said.  ""It's an election issue because currently we are hemorrhaging money into the downstream consequences of bad drug policy and prohibition. Overdoses and overdose deaths and all of the money that we're pouring into all of that right now is really a direct cause of bad drug policy.""    Donald MacPherson, director of the Canadian Drug Policy Coalition at B.C.'s Simon Fraser University, said the overdose death toll demands a quick response through a safe supply of drugs that could be distributed through pharmacies, community health clinics and overdose prevention sites.  ""It's great that Conservatives advocate for expanding treatment. So do all the other parties and so do people who advocate for safe supply. You just need it all at this point,"" said MacPherson, who worked as the first municipal drug policy co-ordinator in North America when he held the post in Vancouver between 2000 and 2009.  Regulating illegal drugs would take years if a government was willing bring in legislation but providing safer drugs is critical during the overdose crisis, he said.",health
72,'You must be very careful': Common questions about CBD health claims for pain and other conditions answered,"Cannabidiol, or CBD oil, is promoted for a wide range of medical conditions. Recently, a review for doctors weighed the science behind the claims.  The Clinicians' Guide to Cannabidiol and Hemp Oils was published earlier this month in the journal Mayo Clinic Proceedings.  CBD is a compound found in the cannabis plant. It is not intoxicating, Health Canada said.  As of October 2018, the sale of dried cannabis, fresh cannabis, cannabis oil, cannabis plants and cannabis seeds are permitted under the the Cannabis Act.  As consumer interest in CBD grows ahead of the Oct. 17 legalization of cannabis edibles, extracts and topicals, here's a primer to answer common questions about its health claims for seizures, pain and other conditions.  What is CBD approved to treat?  Epidiolex, a purified form of plant-based CBD, is the only CBD-related treatment approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is used to treat severe forms of epilepsy. Epidiolex isn't listed in Health Canada's database of medications approved for use in this country.  Health Canada assigns a drug identification number (DIN) to all drug products evaluated and authorized for sale in this country. To qualify, a drug manufacturer needs to provide information including dosing, strength and how it's taken.  ""Currently, there are two cannabis-related drugs that have a DIN and are authorized for sale in Canada,"" a spokesperson for Health Canada said in an email.   Nabilone, a synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, product is approved to treat nausea. THC is the main psychoactive component in cannabis that gives users a high.   The other drug with a DIN is Sativex, which is manufactured from whole botanical extracts and contains THC and CBD, according to Health Canada. Sativex is added to treatments aimed at relieving spasticity in adults with multiple sclerosis. Spasticity is a muscle-control disorder.  No CBD-specific product has a DIN.  As well, no other ""cannabis-related drug (including fresh or dried marijuana or cannabis oil) has been approved to be marketed as a drug for therapeutic use and sale in Canada,"" Health Canada said.   What is CBD commonly used for?  There are anecdotal reports from users of CBD helping with certain types of pain, such as nerve-related back pain.  ""Chronic pain management continues to challenge patients and physicians alike, and investigation into potential therapies such as CBD and hemp oils is a promising area for the future of clinical pain management for both pain relief as well as addiction management,"" Dr. Karen Mauck, an internist at Mayo Clinic, and her co-authors wrote.  Dr. Hance Clarke, director of pain services at Toronto General Hospital who wasn't involved in the U.S. paper, said he starts by asking patients what symptoms they want to use CBD to treat.      It's one of the first times in Canadian history where a medication has made it to the population without the science actually leading us there.  - Dr. Hance Clarke, director of pain services at Toronto General Hospital     ""The evidence has not caught up to the story that's in the public,"" Clarke said. ""It's tricky. It's one of the first times in Canadian history where a medication has made it to the population without the science actually leading us there.""    Physicians need to work with patients to figure out what people are using, the levels in their body and what's actually helped and what hasn't.  ""The world is looking to Canada over the next five to 10 years,"" Clarke said. An evidence-based perspective on cannabis is needed rather than solely industry's, he said.  Canada's Arthritis Society said there's limited clinical evidence so far on the relative benefits and risks of medical cannabis to treat osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.       CBD now is widely used by people for all kinds of disease, in particular anxiety, panic attack, bipolar disorder, depression. But we don't know if CBD is really good for these kind of diseases.  - Dr. Gabriella Gobbi     In January, research into CBD's effects on pain and anxiety in lab rats was published in the scientific journal Pain.  ""CBD now is widely used by people for all kinds of disease, in particular anxiety, panic attack, bipolar disorder, depression,"" said Dr. Gabriella Gobbi, the study's author and a psychiatrist at McGill University's faculty of medicine in Montreal. ""But we don't know if CBD is really good for these kinds of diseases.""  Only clinical trials in humans can show if CBD is really effective for an illness, Gobbi said.  In Canada, pharmaceutical companies are sponsoring clinical trials to test CBD products in people.  How do you know what's in the product?  Depending on what part of the plant is extracted, different components will be present in the oil, the Mayo Clinic authors said. Their list of what clinicians should look for include:     Manufacturing standards certification, such as pesticide or herbicide testing.   European Union, Australian or Canadian organic certification.   Lab testing to confirm cannabinoid levels and the absence of heavy metals.    ""We see variations from batch to batch where patients are doing well on something, and potentially the next time they seek that same product, potentially they're not seeing the same effects,"" Clarke said.  A research letter published in 2017 in JAMA  found nearly 70 per cent of CBD extracts sold online were mislabelled.  ""A lot of CBD oil can have very little or contain lots of THC, so you must be very careful,"" Gobbi said. ""We need more quality control.""  What side-effects have been reported?  In larger studies on CBD treatment for epileptic patients, it was associated with drowsiness, decreased appetite and diarrhea in up to 36 per cent of people, the Mayo Clinic authors said, adding the side-effects were less severe and frequent compared with a conventional anticonvulsant medication.    The FDA said its review of a marketing application for Epidiolex suggested potential for liver injury associated with CBD.      You can't just self-treat.  - Dr. Gabriella Gobbi     ""You can't just self-treat,"" Gobbi said.  What about drug interactions?  The main drug interactions doctors and pharmacists look for are drugs, such as morphine, oxycodone, sleeping pills, antidepressants or antipsychotics, that already make you sleepy, confused or impair co-ordination.  ""If you're taking those medications to begin with and you use cannabis, we'd expect that those side effects would get worse,"" said Kelly Grindrod of the University of Waterloo's School of Pharmacy.    People should talk to their physician, nurse or pharmacist to discuss potential drug interactions when determining whether to try CBD.  Maddie Brown, a registered practical nurse and cannabis consultant based in Ottawa, helps patients with medical cannabis prescriptions understand how CBD works and obtain it.  ""I'm definitely most concerned about blood thinners,"" Brown told CBC Radio's White Coat, Black Art. ""CBD can make Coumadin [a blood thinning medication] more potent.""  The general advice is to start low and go slow, especially if taking medications that are known to interact, Grindrod said.",health
73,Here are some small towns and cities where you can get a well-paying tech job,"Greg Malpass grew up in picturesque Nelson, B.C., a town of around 10,000 nestled in the Selkirk Mountains along Kootenay Lake.  Known for its skiing and hiking, as well as its vibrant arts scene and eclectic array of cafés, stores and microbreweries, it's the kind of small town where city-weary people dream of living — if only they could find a job.  Originally settled during a gold and silver mining boom, Nelson has suffered at times from the ups and downs of its resource-dependent local economy. It became a place that lost its younger folk to bigger cities with more opportunity, Malpass among them.  ""Just like any other ambitious kid, I kind of needed to get out of there to follow my career hopes and aspirations,"" he said.  Malpass went to Simon Fraser University in the Vancouver area, intending to return when he graduated. ""But it became obvious that unless I was going to be a doctor, lawyer or accountant, there wasn't a lot of professional career opportunities for me back there.""   Instead he worked in Toronto for a few years, then Vancouver, where he eventually started a consultancy that has since grown into tech company Traction on Demand. It employs more than 750 people supplying cloud-based applications for use with the popular customer relations platform Salesforce.  But this year, Malpass was able to fulfil his dream of returning to his hometown, establishing a satellite office in Nelson that will eventually be home to 45 employees.  He's one of a growing number of tech founders choosing to locate offices in smaller Canadian towns and cities, addressing the desire of employees to find work in communities they can afford.  Along with the local governments, colleges and universities with whom they partner, these companies are taking steps to spread the wealth, countering what economists say is part of Canada's digital divide — the chasm between those who have access to big-city tech jobs and those who do not.  Making a tech-friendly town  As executive director of Community Futures Central Kootenay, a local non-profit economic development organization, Andrea Wilkey helps nurture Nelson's community of tech and knowledge workers.  Monthly tech meetups bring people together, and free or low-cost courses at the library and community centre ensure kids get a chance to learn to code. Developers who wish to build new housing in the area have to guarantee high speed internet access.    It's all part of ensuring the town isn't too dependent on natural resources, and instead can provide access to jobs in the digital economy — along with a good lifestyle. In addition to Traction, the Kootenays are now home to a number of other tech companies and their satellites, including Retreat Guru, Smrt1 Technologies, Thought Exchange and CoreLogic.  Elsewhere in B.C., tech companies are thriving in places like Kelowna and Vernon in the Okanagan, and in small centres on Vancouver Island, including Qualicum Beach, Courtenay and Duncan.  ""Now's a great time to be growing the tech sector in rural B.C.,"" said Wilkey. ""As the cost of living and housing in major centres becomes increasingly prohibitive, … rural communities have an opportunity to bring new jobs to their region and residents to have a great place to work and live.""    Another upside for Malpass and other tech leaders setting up shop in smaller centres: being able to retain workers who might otherwise be driven away by high housing costs.  As Traction employees entered their 30s and started to think about putting down roots, Malpass said the company started to see ""capable, great employees that have grown up with us start moving.""   Some went to Vancouver Island, others to the B.C. Interior. All told, 15 people left Vancouver in a short time.   Malpass said that got him thinking: ""Why can't we bring great jobs to these great livable communities?""  Traction program architect Emily Beach raised her hand right away when Malpass first started talking about a Nelson office.  ""One of the things I love most in life is being outdoors,"" said Beach. ""I've always looked at people who live in places like Nelson or Pemberton and thought, 'What do you do here? What is allowing you to live in a place like this that you have everything that I want around you — tight-knit community, as well as being in this beautiful environment?'""    Everything started falling into place when Malpass learned that Nelson's local Legion was having a difficult time maintaining its large historic building. He purchased the building, gave the Legion an indefinite lease, and is now renovating the space that will be Traction on Demand's future hometown office.  Beach moved to Nelson in April and is leading a team of seven in a temporary space. Some of the new staffers are locals who previously worked in other tech jobs, and some have no background in technology, including one who worked as a project manager for a paving company.  On the other side of the country, Mike Johnston's company, REDspace, also has its origins in him wanting to return to home turf. Born and raised in Truro, N.S., Johnson studied sciences at Harvard, then worked in tech in the Boston area until the dot-com bubble burst in 2000.  By then, he was married to his high school sweetheart, who'd recently given birth to their first child; the two decided to try their hand at launching a business north of the border.    Things have come along way since Johnston first installed a satellite dish on the roof of their home in Hammonds Plains, on the outskirts of Halifax, in order to get the internet connection he'd need to do some IT consulting from the spare bedroom.  Now headquartered in the Halifax suburb of Bedford, REDspace employs about 200 people who build streaming video technology for television networks.  ""We're finding an increasing interest in people who are looking for a change from the city grind. They're interested in being able to afford a house or have a kayak and go hiking.""  Importing young people  Once known for exporting its young people to other parts of Canada, he said the region is doing a much better job of giving locals and students from the area's colleges and universities a reason to stay after graduation.   ""We're actually hanging onto people and bringing young people to the region, partly because the companies here are doing interesting things.""   REDspace has added more than 50 staff so far this calendar year ""and probably three-quarters of those are from away,"" said Johnston.      Everybody thought we were crazy for leaving the tech ecosystem of the world.  - Jordan Boesch, CEO at 7shifts     Saskatoon is also home to a burgeoning new tech scene — and Jordan Boesch's company 7shifts is a part of that.  He got the idea to build a scheduling platform for the restaurant industry because his dad struggled with co-ordinating staff at the Quiznos locations he ran in Regina.  ""I taught myself to code and built something rudimentary to get the job done,"" he said.  Boesch, his wife and co-founder moved to San Francisco after their idea was accepted into a tech accelerator there. But when they secured some venture capital, they decided to take it back to Canada to make it go further.  ""Everybody thought we were crazy for leaving the tech ecosystem of the world,"" he said.    But being in Saskatoon has allowed them to recruit staff who are among the University of Saskatchewan's computer science graduates. The company now employs 140 people.  Boesch said he feels good about being part of spreading the wealth of tech jobs to places outside of Canada's biggest cities.  ""I don't know if it's just because of the farm background we have here in Saskatchewan, but we have a lot of hard-working people. Being able to take that hard-working grittiness and channel it into growing a tech company is really exciting.""",technology
74,Triumph of engineering: Halifax man switching classic car to electric power,"A research engineer at Dalhousie University is in the process of retrofitting his classic car to be powered by electricity.  Nathaniel Pearre brought his 1971 Triumph Spitfire to the Halifax Waterfront on Saturday for the Electric Avenue — an event that touts itself as the largest electric vehicle event in Atlantic Canada.  ""Having a little electric convertible is something that's a little bit rare on the market and having something that has the vintage style is a nice touch,"" Pearre said.  Pearre is with the Renewable Energy Storage Laboratory at Dalhousie, a group he described as ""enthusiasts of all things electric, including renewable energy and energy storage and electric drive.""  Getting started  He found the convertible in New Brunswick on Kijiji about a year ago. He said it was a good candidate for an electric conversion because ""it had a pretty solid frame and body, but a lousy drive train.""  During the winter, Pearre said he slowly removed all the greasy bits and over the summer he hired an undergrad, Mitch Gregory, to work on the vehicle to develop necessary enclosures and to do a lot of the fabrication work.  ""We were in the Dalhousie heavy prototype lab, so we could really make some progress over the summer and get it to the state that it was in at the show, but we had to get out of the lab by the time the students came back for fall semester,"" he said.  Almost ready to drive  The convertible isn't ready to drive — but it's close. ""There's a lot of fiddly work,"" Pearre said.  ""In an ideal world, it might be two more weeks of work but it's gone from being a full-time project of an energetic undergrad to a weekend and evenings project, so timelines tend to drag,"" he said.  ""But we hope to make it driveable, if not get it on the road by the end of the year, and then over a long cold winter try to refine suspension and make it more roadworthy.""  He said retrofitting a classic car to be electric is not the most sensible or the most economical route, but he said it's a great route for anyone wanting a hobby and a passion and a fun vehicle for Sunday driving.  ""The motivation for building this car was not to save the world, the motivation for building this car was to have fun,"" he said.  MORE TOP STORIES",technology
75,No laughing matter: Critics and audiences debate whether Joker and Jojo Rabbit go too far,"UPDATE: Jojo Rabbit won TIFF's top prize, the People's Choice Award, on Sunday afternoon.    As the city burns, a clown puts his fingers in his bloody mouth and pulls his cheeks into a leering red grin. His crowd of followers bellows in approval.  During the Second World War, a young boy learning to be a good Nazi charges into the forest, with Adolf Hitler skipping merrily at his side.   Those are two distinctive images from two movies dividing audiences at the Toronto International Film Festival.   You could say TIFF has been a festival of extremes. This is where the race to the Oscars begins, and at this point, it could be Mister Rogers and the Joker in a dead heat.  A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood features Tom Hanks as Fred Rogers, the convivial children's television host. The role fits Hanks as snugly as Rogers's sweater. Hanks nails Rogers's singsong voice as well as the intense interest he showed in everyone he met.     But while A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is a feel-good tearjerker, Joker is quite the opposite — a grimy descent that serves as the origin story for one of the most iconic DC Comics characters.  There have been many Jokers, but with Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, the man who becomes the murderous clown, we see the person under the face paint, his bitterness building into a brutal crescendo of violence.   While many of the cast on the red carpet for A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood said they felt the world could use more Mister Rogers right now, Joker is just as much a reflection of our time — albeit, a cracked and twisted view some critics have called irresponsible.  Writing in Time magazine, Stephanie Zacharek described Joker as a prime example of the ""emptiness of our culture"" and called Arthur the ""patron saint of incels.""    While Hollywood Reporter awards columnist Scott Feinberg considers Phoenix an Oscar contender, he warned the film could incite ""real-world problems.""    In the Globe and Mail, Sarah Hagi said Phoenix's Joker represents an ideology, ""becoming more vigilante than villain.""  Speaking to CBC News at the TIFF premiere of the film, Joker director Todd Phillips defended his work.    ""I think a lot of the criticism comes from people who haven't seen the movie yet. We've only showed the movie in Venice and nobody there had that reaction ... I would say, see the movie and judge for yourself.""  Last weekend, the competition jury in Venice awarded Joker the festival's highest honour, the Golden Lion, the first time the prize has gone to a film inspired by a comic book.   Psychos, drivers and clowns  There's nothing novel about a film that explores the minds of deeply disturbed characters.  Think of American Psycho, or Taxi Driver, or A Clockwork Orange — there have always been films that attempt to take us inside the headspace of disturbed individuals.  As Patrick Bateman, Christian Bale exemplified the shallow single-mindedness of the 1980s in American Psycho.  As Travis Bickle, Robert De Niro embodied a desperate sense of loneliness in Taxi Driver.     For his role in Joker, Phoenix dropped more than 50 pounds, transforming into a sinewy scarecrow, topped with a smiling face, absent any joy.   Like many of the films at TIFF such as The Laundromat, Hustlers and Parasite, the backdrop of the Joker is a place of economic disparity. This Gotham is plagued by garbage strikes and super rats. Thugs roam the streets while Thomas Wayne promises to save the upper crust from the chaos. Almost by accident, the Joker becomes a symbol to the angry masses who want to pull Gotham's gleaming towers down.   With the dingy colour scheme and sickly lighting, director Todd Phillips pays homage to, or perhaps outright borrows from, Taxi Driver. But whereas Travis Bickle articulated his own warped view of the world, Arthur Fleck could be seen as a product of his environment.     Arthur is like a weed growing in an abandoned garden. He's the result of a life of neglect, abuse and mental illness. Someone who is ignored and mocked. It's only when Arthur guns down a trio of rich business bros who are bullying him that the citizens of Gotham finally take notice.  For director Phillips, there is a sense of inevitability to the character.  ""Our vision was a guy who ultimately has to become the Joker, so there's gonna be a little bit of anger and rebellion in him.""  Judging Jojo Rabbit's satirical take on Nazi Germany     While the potency of Joker's punchline is no laughing matter, it's the very fact that Jojo Rabbit presents a comedic take on Adolf Hitler that has some critics concerned.   The film, directed by Taika Waititi, follows the life of a young German boy named Jojo during the final days of the Second World War. Jojo dreams of being a good Nazi and is helped by his imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler, played by Waititi.   Waititi plays the dictator in the irreverent style the actoru002Fdirector is known for. The film opens with Hitler acting as Jojo's life coach, teaching him how to do a proper ""Heil Hitler!"" salute and preparing him for his first day of Hitler youth camp.     Waititi first became interested in making the film after his Jewish mother gave him the book Caging Skies, which formed the basis of the screenplay.   Speaking with CBC News at the world premiere in Toronto, he said his original intention was to make a film about intolerance and bigotry. But as hate groups seemed to proliferate and Nazis began to reappear in the news, Jojo's story became even more relevant, he said.     Waititi points to a 2018 poll in the United States that suggested 66 per cent of millennials didn't understand the relevance of Auschwitz.  ""They didn't know what it was, or where it was, or what it meant,"" Waititi said of the Nazi concentration camp where Jews were murdered en masse during the Second World War. ""So I think more than ever, it's vital that we [remind] people of what happened.""    But some critics have suggested Waititi could have gone much further. Variety critic Owen Gleiberman says Jojo Rabbit is a movie ""that pretends to be audacious when it's actually quite tidy and safe."" Indiewire's Eric Khon writes Waititi's whimsical approach ""makes Life is Beautiful look like Shoah.""    While some critics questioned the wisdom of portraying Hitler as a hipster idiot, Roman Griffin Davis, who played young Jojo, says the film shows the effects of the dictator's reign.   ""He's portrayed as a terrible person, through seeing Germany and these little boys terrified. Yeah, it might seem a bit odd, but he's still portrayed as an evil man.""  What some of the initial reactions to the trailer missed is the heart of the film, which focuses on Elsa, the young Jewish woman whom Jojo's mother is hiding from the authorities.      Sweetness and shock  From the film Boy to Hunt for the Wilderpeople to even Thor: Ragnarok, Waititi excels at stories with hidden centres of sweetness. For all their posturing, his heroes are often quite innocent, as is the case with Jojo, a boy who is desperate to join the cause, until he meets a real Jew.   As Elsa says to him at one point, ""You're not a Nazi, Jojo. You're a 10-year-old kid who likes dressing up in a funny uniform and wants to be part of a club.""  True, Jojo Rabbit doesn't peer into the heart of darkness of the Third Reich, and many of the more monstrous crimes of the Nazi regime happen off camera.  But as Waititi brings us into Jojo's world, there is a moment where the inhumanity and indifference of the Nazi regime hits home. A moment that left audiences in Toronto gasping.    Speaking to CBC News, Waititi underlined the importance of finding new ways to explore intolerance.  ""If that involves having to bring in fantasy characters and using magic realism and using different techniques and sometimes comedy, so be it. We have to keep telling these stories.""",entertainment
76,Hospital network sets aside $10M parcel of land for affordable housing,"The University Health Network (UHN) has aside a $10-million parcel of land in Parkdale for an affordable housing project, which it says is a direct response to the needs of its low-income patients.  The UHN's executive director of health and social policy, Dr. Andrew Boozary, said the network is partnering with the City of Toronto and United Way on the Social Medicine Initiative.  The aim is to ease homelessness and improve the health of people living in communities served by Toronto Western and Toronto General hospitals.  ""One of the neighbourhoods is Parkdale, where we see a lot of homeless patients or precariously-housed patients with a lot of both medical and social needs that have been coming into our Toronto Western Hospital,"" Boozary told CBC Toronto.  ""And one of the things that we realized, again from our data and from working with our partners, is that we actually have the highest rate of homeless patients coming into our emergency department at the Toronto Western.""  More than 20 repeat visits in a year  The UHN is a healthcare and medical research organization affiliated with the University of Toronto's faculty of medicine. In addition to Toronto Western and Toronto General, it includes the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto Rehab and the Michener Institute.  UHN data for the period April 2018 to March 2019 shows 61 patients each made more than 20 visits to Toronto General and Toronto Western hospitals. That's a total of 2,096 visits for each of those patients, out of a total of 48,182 visits to UHN emergency departments.  ""We realized that to better serve these patients, to better provide care, we have to be thinking about where they're being discharged home to,"" Boozary said.    ""For many of them, if they do not have adequate or stable housing, that is a major predicament for any health improvement.""  UHN said this is the first time ever in Canada that a health network is building housing to directly answer the needs of its low-income patients.  The network said sick people can't get better if they don't have secure access to food, are vulnerably housed and without ongoing social supports.  ""The reality is, the social safety net in many ways is being torn apart. Those patients fall on us at the hospital and we have to recognize that we have to not only think differently but behave differently in the social crisis that we're facing,"" Boozary told CBC news.",health
77,'More than we expected': Ocearch spots 5 great white sharks off Cape Breton,"Five great white sharks have been spotted and three of them have been tagged in Ocearch's latest expedition off the coast of Cape Breton.  ""I think that is more than we expected, especially when we're only about halfway through the trip,"" Chris Fischer, the founder and expedition leader of Ocearch, said in a phone interview on Sunday.  The U.S.-based shark research organization is currently off Scatarie Island, near Hay Island.  They started around Sept. 14 and expect to be out until Oct. 4. Then the next stop is West Ironbound Island on Oct. 6.  Two of the tagged sharks are mature males, Murdoch and Sydney, and the other is a mature female named Unama'ki.    Sydney was 3.7 metres long, Murdoch was 3.9 metres long and Unama'ki was 4.7 metres long. In addition to being tagged, each shark received a full health assessment.  ""So, interesting to see that all the sharks we've engaged with out here have all been fully mature animals,"" Fischer said. ""I think that's something significant that was different than what we saw down in Lunenburg last year.""  Off Lunenburg, Fischer said they sampled seven animals — five males, two females — and only three were mature. The others were ""sub-adults.""  'The trip's already made'  Temperatures off Scaterie Island, Fischer said, are ""a little cold"" but that ""doesn't seem to have run off the sharks.""  Prior to making the trip to the island, Fischer said he had no idea what to expect. He said they were hopeful because Hilton, a celebrity great white shark with more than 51,000 followers on Twitter, was traced in those waters last year.  ""Having three sharks already tagged, for me, the trip's already made,"" Fischer said. ""When you're coming to a place no one has ever been before and you don't know what's going to happen, that's a pleasant surprise.""      The goal of the shark research is to find out as much as possible about the Canadian great white shark — where it  forages, mates, gives birth, migrates and where females gestate.  ""And that's so you can keep the recovery going because as the white shark goes, the whole system goes,"" he said. ""If the white sharks are thriving up here, there's going to be more fish for your commercial and recreational fisheries.""  Fischer says there are ""hundreds and hundreds of seals"" around Scaterie Island.    He said past research has indicated that when there are great white sharks around, seals feed one-fourth as much each day as they do when white sharks aren't there.  ""So as the white shark population recovers, it will keep those seals pinned up on the beach,"" he said. ""They stay there until they're almost starving and then they go out and get a little food and then they get back out because they might get eaten.""  Details on shark tracking are on Ocearch's website.    MORE TOP STORIES",technology
78,From oil to beer: How pipeline technology could change the food industry,"The Inventions of Oil is a CBC Edmonton series about oil and gas innovations hidden in our everyday lives    The story of a pipeline project that took years to get from drawing board to shovels in the ground might sound routine to Albertans in the thick of oil pipeline politics.  But what if it was a pipeline that transported beer?   It turns out the same technology that moves as much as 3.9 million barrels of oil from Western Canada every day is at the heart of an emerging effort around the globe to rethink how food, drinks and other products are shipped.     Refining the Hula Hoop: how the oil industry sparked a global plastics boom    In Bruges, Belgium, for example, as much as 6,000 litres of beer per hour is pumped through a 3.2-kilometre underground pipeline that stretches from the centuries-old De Halve Maan brewery and restaurant to its new bottling plant outside of town.  The pipeline was first proposed in 2010 as an alternative to transporting beer by truck through the city's bumpy, congested streets, said Xavier Vanneste, the company's CEO and a sixth-generation brewer.  ""In the beginning, people thought it was a joke,"" Vanneste said.   ""Some people said the real estate value alongside the track would grow. Some people were making jokes about making tapping points and leaks, but then as soon as the project continued, and as soon as we advanced, you saw that people were really very enthusiastic about the idea.""  The $5.6 million Cdn project took five years to acquire permits and financing, then another five months to build. By 2016, it was up and running.     With fewer trucks on the road, the brewery's carbon footprint is reduced. As well, the pipeline does a better job of keeping the beer carbonated and, without the need to connect and reconnect tanks, there's less oxidation along the way.   That, said Vanneste, has had a very important impact: better-tasting beer.  The evolution of pipelines  While pipeline systems for water date back to ancient civilizations, most modern technology has been driven by the oil industry, said Mahdi Vaezi, an assistant professor of engineering at Northern Illinois University. He researched alternative uses for pipelines while at the University of Alberta from 2009 through 2014.   ""Any other application of pipelines, it's fair to say it's been developed based on oil pipelines,"" Vaezi said.   Over the last century, the oil and gas industries have led to advancements in pipeline materials, pump technology and leak prevention, he said.     How the country's new pipeline dispute could shake up oil business   Pipeline rupture sends 40,000 litres of oil into Alberta creek    There are 433,000 kilometres of oil and gas pipelines under the jurisdiction of the Alberta Energy Regulator. They would stretch well past the moon if placed end-to-end.   Alberta's pipelines predominantly are used for moving oil and gas products — natural gas, oil well effluent, fuel gas, sour natural gas and more — but pipelines can be used to move almost anything.       Oilpatch pushes for construction to start immediately on green-lit Trans Mountain pipeline     ""Pretty much whatever you can think of has been transported through a pipeline,"" Vaezi said. His research found examples of pipelines moving coal, gold slime, limestone, iron ore and even wood chips.   The Belgian brewery may be the first to build an underground pipeline for beer but it's not the first food business to adopt the technology.   Other food producers are using it but on a much smaller scale, said Sylvain Charlebois, a Dalhousie University professor in Halifax who researches food transportation.       Pretty much whatever you can think of has been transported through a pipeline.  - Mahdi Vaezi, engineering professor Northern Illinois University     The maple syrup industry uses what is essentially a mini-pipeline to connect the sap and water from thousands of trees, he said.   ""On a maple syrup farm, those pipelines could extend well over 10 to 20 kilometres,"" he said.   Commercial dairy farmers adopted the technology in the mid-20th century, moving cow's milk from udder to tankers via a vacuum network of steel pipelines.     More than half of Canadians may have trouble adopting new food guide, survey suggests    Charlebois said there is the potential for agribusiness to scale-up its use of pipeline technology.   ""Prices of food are going up in the U.S. because they don't have enough drivers. With pipelines you don't need drivers,"" Charlebois said. ""If you do it right you could actually make the country more food-secure.""    Fishing for a new food transportation network  A move from steel pipelines to more durable thermoplastics was first introduced by Middle East oil companies to prevent corrosion.   In turn, the thermoplastics technology was used by Seattle-based Whooshh Innovations to make tube systems that move salmon over dams. A video of the process, showing salmon flying through a tube from one body of water to another, has garnered millions of views on YouTube.    According to Jim Otten, Whooshh's vice-president of engineering, the company first started working with Washington's agriculture department but pivoted when the founder saw live fish being assisted by helicopters during their migration.   Unlike underground pipelines, Whooshh's thermoplastic, above-ground tubes are flexible, allowing them to conform to oddly shaped objects. Companies in Norway use their tubes in fish-processing facilities, moving whole and gutted fish from one plant to another.   ""We can put a salmon in the tube but we also can put an apple in the tube or a watermelon or something that's as weird as chicken or potatoes,"" Otten said.   Beyond a pipe dream  Moving agricultural products through pipelines was also a focus of Vaezi's research while at the U of A. Adapted pipelines could make it 50 per cent cheaper to move agricultural waste like straw and corn stover for use as biofuel, he said.  While Vaezi isn't convinced of the economic value of the large-scale transportation of food products, Vanneste, back in Belgium, is a believer. In fact, other wineries and breweries have been visiting to see if the technology could work for them, he said.     Happy hour not over for Alberta's craft beer boom   Meet Watershed Brewing Co.: Alberta's most real fake brewery    ""Everybody is looking at how they can reduce their carbon footprint and how they can reduce heavy transportation in small city centres,"" he said. ""This is actually a very positive solution to that.""",technology
79,"Sudbury researcher has closer look at makeup of McIntyre Powder, once used in mining","Before each shift between the 1940s and 1970s, underground miners in northern Ontario breathed in a substance they thought was protecting their lungs, but none of them knew what exactly was in McIntyre Powder. Until now.  Many of these mine workers developed respiratory or neurological illnesses, later in life.  It was a connection Laurentian University researcher Andrew Zarnke wanted to pursue.    The occupational health coordinator has recently published a paper on the physical and chemical makeup of McIntyre Powder.  He expected to find aluminum and aluminum hydroxide.  But he also discovered the powder was made up of microscopic, ultra-fine particles, known as nanoparticles.  Previous research has connected nanoparticles — of any substance — to harmful health issues, particularly when they're inhaled. This includes studies on diesel exhaust particulates, which is also a current health concern in mining.  ""With nano-technologies these days, you know it brings McIntyre Powder into the arena with a lot of these more recent studies that are looking at health effects from nano-materials,"" Zarnke said.  'No longer a dirty little secret somewhere'  For the past five years, Janice Martell has been collecting health data from miners across northern Ontario who were exposed to the powder. Her father was forced to inhale the substance and later was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease. She now feel her work to uncover the truth has been validated.  ""It bears witness to what they went through and it also gives us some information to answer the next steps,"" she said.    Martell is especially pleased for what this means for the men who were exposed to the aluminum dust, and their loved ones.  ""Being able to go back to miners, mine workers and their families and say 'Hey this is no longer a dirty little secret somewhere that they were sweeping under the rug,'"" Martell said.  ""And to be able to provide them with some answers as to what their loved one or themselves were exposed to.""  More research needed  Zarnke says the next phase of the research involves biological studies to see how human cells react to McIntyre Powder.  ""Next steps which involve some biological studies looking at possible geno-toxic effects from the combined stressors of McIntyre Powder or nano-materials and radiation.""  ""So we're now using the information from this new publication to generate hypotheses with regards to possible biological mechanisms and health affects,"" he said.  ""Being able to provide something like this [research] and say here's one more piece of the puzzle is validating,"" Martell said.  The research is available online at the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Hygiene. It will be published in the November issue of the journal.  Zarnke and Martell will be in Elliot Lake Sept. 23 to hold a public information session. While in the community they also plan to meet with local physicians to discuss mining exposures and health.",technology
80,Placido Domingo to resume US performances amid misconduct allegations,"When opera superstar Placido Domingo appeared in Europe last month after being accused of sexual harassment by multiple women, his performances were greeted with rapturous ovations.  This week, the spotlight moves to the U.S., where Domingo faces two investigations into his behaviour and is scheduled to help kick off the new season at New York's Metropolitan Opera. Companies in three other American cities have cancelled his performances due to the allegations.  Wednesday's appearance in Macbeth marks the legendary tenor's first performance in the U.S. since the publication of two Associated Press stories in which numerous women said he sexually harassed them or engaged in other inappropriate behaviour, including one soprano who said he grabbed her bare breast under her robe.  Domingo has called the allegations ""in many ways, simply incorrect,"" without providing any specifics.    Domingo is general director of LA Opera, which has engaged outside counsel to conduct its investigation. He also is being investigated by the American Guild of Musical Artists, the union representing many opera employees.  The Met has said it will wait for the results of the LA Opera investigation before deciding on any action against Domingo, who is scheduled to perform at the storied opera house seven times this season.  Emotional, heated meeting at The Met  The Met's general manager, Peter Gelb, held a one-hour meeting with chorus singers and orchestra musicians after a dress rehearsal Saturday to discuss the Mets' position on the allegations.  In characterizing the meeting, Gelb said, ""I said we took the allegations very seriously. For some people, allegations are enough to warrant actions, but the Met as an institution does not believe it can take action until there is corroborated evidence, which has so far not been the case.""  Gelb said he also noted the Met was closely monitoring the two investigations and ""we are prepared to take action when action is merited.""  One musician who attended the meeting and spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation described the session as heated and often emotional.  Some staff members were visibly emotional as they challenged Gelb, the musician said, with at least one telling him, ""This is exactly why women don't come forward."" But one female chorus member spoke up in support of the Met's position, the musician noted.  Several attendees complained the Met was being inconsistent, referring to the 2018 firing of its famed conductor, James Levine, amid accusations that he had sexually abused several men when they were teenagers. The company initially suspended Levine in 2017 after the allegations surfaced and then severed ties with him after conducting its own investigation.  Domingo was not at the staff meeting, but did participate in a previously scheduled sexual harassment seminar last week with fellow cast members, according to a Met staff member with direct knowledge of the meeting, who spoke on condition of anonymity for the same reasons.  Music workers union investigates  The AGMA launched its own investigation after saying it couldn't be certain that opera companies would thoroughly investigate the allegations or make their findings public.  The union's national executive director, Len Egert, told the AP that AGMA hopes its inquiry can be wrapped up ""in a couple of months.""  He said he could not provide details, but indicated the union also is taking on board the wider problem of misconduct across the industry and the fear of retaliation by men in positions of power.    ""In addition to what we have done so far, AGMA will continue to search for and implement methods to change the culture,"" he said.  Domingo is scheduled to appear in three performances of Macbeth, two of them opposite the soprano Anna Netrebko, and then return to the Met for four performances of Madama Butterfly in November.  Outside the Met, Domingo's next scheduled U.S. performance is not until February, with LA Opera, which has not said how long it expects its investigation to last.  Three major American companies — the Philadelphia Orchestra, the San Francisco Opera and Dallas Opera — cancelled upcoming concerts starring Domingo after the AP stories were published.  None of Domingo's upcoming performances in Europe have been cancelled; he has a busy fall lineup of operas and concerts in Switzerland, Russia, Austria, Germany, Spain, Italy and Poland.    The most serious allegation against Domingo comes from soprano Angela Turner Wilson, now a voice teacher in the Dallas area, who said he forcefully grabbed her breast in a makeup room during a run at the Washington Opera in 1999.  The Washington Opera issued statements saying it has ""zero tolerance"" for harassment but did not receive any ""documented complaints"" about Domingo's behaviour during his 15 years as artistic director and general director of the company. It has declined to comment on whether it plans any investigation.  LA Opera inquiry continues  During its inquiry, the LA Opera — which Domingo helped found in the 1980s, and where several accusations of sexual misconduct occurred — has removed Domingo from day-to-day operations as general director, a post he has held since 2003.  The investigation is being led by Debra Wong Yang, a former U.S. attorney and Los Angeles County Superior Court judge, now a partner at the law firm of Gibson Dunn &amp; Crutcher.    In a statement emailed to the AP, a committee of LA Opera board members urged anyone with relevant information to contact Gibson Dunn and provide statements on the record, adding that, if requested, they ""will take reasonable efforts to keep the individual's identity as confidential as possible.""  The committee added that the LA Opera ""strictly prohibits retaliation of any kind against anyone participating in this investigation in good faith.""  The union also has said it will allow participants to remain anonymous if they request it.  Sexual harassment experts say allowing confidential reports is crucial to a thorough investigation because of the fear of retaliation in an insular industry like opera.",entertainment
81,"Nissan paying $15M, Ghosn $1M to settle SEC fraud charges","Nissan has agreed to pay $15 million US and its former chairman Carlos Ghosn is paying $1 million to settle federal regulators' civil fraud charges of hiding from investors more than $140 million in compensation and retirement benefits for Ghosn.  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the settlement Monday with the Japanese automaker and its former chairman, who also agreed to be barred for 10 years from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  Ghosn is awaiting trial in Japan on financial misconduct allegations.  Ghosn, who led Nissan for two decades, was arrested by Japanese authorities in Tokyo and jailed four times since November. Ghosn has maintained he is innocent. He is currently out on bail but faces restrictions on his activities such as not being allowed to contact his wife, Carole Ghosn. She has appeared before a Japanese judge to answer questions in the case. The first hearing in the trial has been set for April.  Ghosn and Nissan Motor Co. settled the charges without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, but agreed to refrain from future anti-fraud violations of the securities laws.  In addition, a former Nissan director, Greg Kelly, agreed to pay a $100,000 penalty to settle the SEC charges, to be barred for five years from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and to be suspended for five years from practicing as an attorney before the SEC.  In a statement, Ghosn's team of lawyers noted that he will be allowed to contest and deny the allegations in the criminal case in Japan, and they said he ""fully intends to do so.""  ""Mr. Ghosn and his defence team are now able to focus their efforts on continuing to vigorously fight the criminal case in Japan and pursue his claims against Nissan around the world,"" the statement said. ""They remain confident that, if given a fair trial, he will be acquitted of all charges and fully vindicated.""  Attorneys representing Nissan declined to comment on the SEC settlement. An attorney for Kelly wasn't immediately available for comment.  Alleged undisclosed compensation  Starting in 2009, Ghosn — with the help of Kelly and subordinates at Nissan — conducted a scheme to conceal more than $90 million of his compensation from investors and public disclosure, while also acting to increase his retirement benefits by over $50 million, the SEC alleged. Each year, Ghosn fixed a total amount of compensation for himself, with a certain amount paid and disclosed, and an additional amount unpaid and undisclosed, according to the agency.  The regulators said that Ghosn and his subordinates concocted various ways of structuring payment of the undisclosed compensation after his retirement, including entering into secret contracts, backdating letters to grant him interests in Nissan's long-term incentive plan, and changing the way his pension was calculated to generate over $50 million in additional benefits.  ""Simply put, Nissan's disclosures about Ghosn's compensation were false,"" Steven Peikin, co-director of the SEC's enforcement division, said in a statement. ""Through these disclosures, Nissan advanced Ghosn and Kelly's deceptions and misled investors, including U.S. investors.""",business
82,Downton Abbey returns to offer comfort in today's 'whirlpool' of turmoil,"Lady Edith is cheerful and contented — and that's saying something, given how life has given the middle Crawley sister on Downton Abbey a considerable dose of heartbreak.  So is Daisy, the under cook, who tells her sympathetic kitchen boss Mrs. Patmore: ""I'm happy. I don't often say it, but I am.""  Lady Edith and Daisy end up revelling in their fortunate emotional state as the British TV period melodrama that brought them into living rooms around the world makes its much-anticipated return as a feature film, opening in North American theatres today.  And in that, the movie goes some distance toward a goal its creators had of offering moviegoers some emotional succor against the backdrop of a planet in turmoil.  ""In a world that is lacking in certainty, I hope that, for the price of a cinema ticket, viewers will get two hours of comfort and reassurance in return,"" creator Julian Fellowes told Harper's Bazaar. ""A bit of a rest from the whirlpool.""   That goal wasn't lost on the actors who reunited for the big screen.    ""There's so much uncertainty … and this is like an antidote to all the horrors that [are] going on,"" Phyllis Logan, who plays housekeeper Elsie Hughes, said this week as she stopped off in Toronto to promote the film.  Lesley Nicol, who plays Mrs. Patmore, also sees the film offering audiences more than escapism.  ""It does celebrate things that people do value, like being decent with each other and ... being loyal to people and all those traits,"" Nicol said during the media stop at Spadina Museum.  ""At heart, [these values are] very important and it feels in this world at the moment that some of the people in charge are not giving that any thought at all, and I think it reassures people.""  Maybe we're more aware  Not that these times are necessarily more stressful than previous eras, but perhaps people are more aware of the turmoil in the world, when the next bad headline is right there waiting on the screen of your phone.  ""I don't know if it's so much the geopolitical world as it is the way modern media presents it to people,"" said Michael Kennedy, a Downton fan and film and television director who also teaches directing at Sheridan College in Oakville, Ont.  ""I think you'd be hard-pressed to say today films serve as comfort more than in the past, but I think audiences seek it and need it more because they're more aware of the anxiety and dangers that are out there in the world.""    In the world of Downton Abbey, however, there isn't a lot of anxiety or danger. The aristocratic Crawley family lives upstairs in the elegantly appointed big house (Highclere Castle in real life), with their loyal staff below stairs. Lives and loves unfold with a fair degree of melodrama.  In one of the TV show's soapier moments, Lady Mary had to sort out how to deal with the dead body of a handsome Turkish diplomat who succumbed to a heart attack while in bed with her, a story Fellowes has said is based on a real incident.  In the case of the film, the central tenet is how a visit by King George V and Queen Mary to Downton Abbey in 1927 will affect everyone — upstairs and down.  ""In today's time, that's a fairly minor issue considering the slate of things that most people see in the news ... and have to deal with every day, so I believe, yes [Downton Abbey] is providing a comfort and an escape,"" said Kennedy, much like other popular films this year such as The Lion King or How to Train Your Dragon.  That's not to say Downton Abbey doesn't give a nod to issues of its day that are more fraught — a police raid on an illegal nightclub where gay men gather offers the audience some moments of sober second thought.    Downton Abbey's return comes more than three years after the series left TV with a boatload of awards and much praise for its high production values, but no promise of a return.  Still, fans always hoped the aristocratic Crawleys and their downstairs staff would be back. When advance tickets went on sale last month, the movie had more sales than any other drama so far this year.     Are you ready to return to Downton Abbey? This superfan is    And when those moviegoers settle into their seats, they'll be transported back to the familiar opening scenes and sounds of the clacking of a train down a track and the dinging of a service bell.  Even in that familiarity, there can be some solace for the audience.  ""I think people become attached to these details and then are psychologically prepared to relax for an hour or two and be entertained and comforted by some of their favourite characters,"" said Kennedy.  Back in fine form  Those favourites are all back in fine form in the movie, from Maggie Smith's Dowager Countess of Grantham (and her zingers) to Mrs. Hughes and her now-husband, Carson, the retired butler who returns to give his downstairs guidance as the house prepares for the royal visit.    ""As a fan of the show, you're rooting for the happiness of characters … from different backgrounds and different ages and different walks of life,"" said Michael Rubinoff, co-producer of the theatrical juggernaut Come from Away.  ""And I think we like seeing that mirror reflected. We may not be an earl or a count or a member of the Royal Family, but perhaps we see ourselves in some of the other characters or in the working-class characters, regardless of class.""  Logan said the cast has a character everybody can relate to, whether it's Barrow, now the butler, or Lady Mary.  ""They were all developed over the years,"" said Nicol. ""We were on a journey, but the audience were on it with us for sure. [Fellowes] developed everybody's story because he's such a good writer and I think that's what happened. People got hooked into what's going to happen to them next.""     Downton Abbey returns: The enduring charm of lavish living    As much as Downton Abbey was praised for its writing, storytelling, lush costumes and scenes, it also faced its share of criticism during its TV run, from quibbles over historical accuracy to debate over its portrayal of class.  Still, suggests Rubinoff, such criticism doesn't diminish the entertainment value and any emotional response a show such as Downton can provide or provoke, even for a little while.  ""Whether you have questions about things that are factual — whether you say, oh it's just entertainment and everything's going on around it, you cannot deny an emotional response to … something that's in the arts-related or entertainment mediums,"" said Rubinoff.  ""Those feelings are real.""    Of course, any happiness audience members might feel after seeing something like Downton Abbey may not last that long after they leave the theatre.  ""But it does allow you to engage with others in a certain way that might be more positive than if you hadn't watched that … coming into your workplace and having a discussion about how much you enjoyed something,"" said Rubinoff, who is also creative producing director of the Canadian Music Theatre Project at Sheridan.  ""That might just set a positive tone to the day or strengthen a relationship between colleagues or people. I think that's a good thing.""  Obviously, Rubinoff said, the Downton creators weren't setting out to do a documentary. It's a drama, more in that realm of soap opera.  ""But if you find something joyous, I think that emotional response should be embraced, and that's good entertainment.""",entertainment
83,Alberta parents David and Collet Stephan found not guilty in their toddler's death after retrial,"An Alberta couple who treated their son's illness with natural remedies rather than take him to a doctor have been found not guilty in the toddler's death after a retrial.  David and Collet Stephan were tried on charges of failing to provide the necessaries of life to 19-month-old Ezekiel, who died in 2012.   Supporters in the courtroom cheered and Collet Stephan cried as she hugged her husband.  Court of Queen's Bench Justice Terry Clackson spoke to the court in Lethbridge, Alta., for only four minutes on Thursday before releasing his written decision in the judge-alone trial.   The judge ultimately sided with the defence's medical experts in finding the boy had viral not bacterial meningitis and ultimately died of a lack of oxygen.   Speaking with the media after the decision was handed down, David Stephan called the last seven years an ""emotional roller-coaster.""    ""We didn't know what to expect coming into today, and it's the right decision, and it's shocking because it's been seven years of our life fighting this so it's become part of our identity,"" he said.  ""It's a beautiful thought that we can move on with our lives.""  Stephan said his case ""helps protect parental rights"" so that parents won't be held criminally liable if they choose alternative treatments for their sick children.  He also says the fight isn't over between his family and the Alberta government — he still wants to recoup the $1.2 million he says his family has spent in legal fees.   This was the second trial for the Stephans, who were found guilty by a Lethbridge jury in 2016. While the Alberta Court of Appeal upheld the conviction, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled the original trial judge erred in his instructions to the jury.    Appeal not ruled out  Back then, the official cause of death was bacterial meningitis.  However, in his written decision, Clackson wrote that he accepted the opinion of Alberta's former chief medical officer, Dr. Anny Sauvageau, who told court she does not believe Ezekiel actually died from bacterial meningitis.   ""In this case, we know there is no specific treatment that is effective for viral meningitis,"" Clackson wrote.  ""It follows that the Crown did not prove medical attention would have saved [Ezekiel's] life or that if he had viral meningitis and it was life-threatening [which is not established in the evidence], medical attention even could have saved his life.""  In a written statement, the Alberta Crown Prosecution Service said it has not yet decided whether to appeal Clackson's decision.  ""We respect the decision of the Court,"" reads the statement. ""This has been a challenging case for everyone involved. The Alberta Crown Prosecution Service will review the decision to determine next steps.""  Treated with natural remedies  Over the course of the trial, the Stephans testified that they initially thought Ezekiel had croup, an upper airway infection, and they treated him with natural remedies including a smoothie with garlic, onion and horseradish.  They said he appeared to be recovering at times, and they saw no reason to take him to hospital, despite his having a fever and lacking energy.  They called an ambulance when the boy stopped breathing.  David Stephan, who was representing himself, said in his final arguments that it was paramedics who caused Ezekiel's death by improperly intubating the boy.      'Bad things happen to good parents,' defence argues at trial of Alberta couple in son's meningitis death     Sauvageau also suggested Ezekiel might have lived had the first ambulance to Cardston, Alta., been better equipped to treat a child his age with breathing difficulties.   Clackson also heard evidence the parents suspected the boy had meningitis and were told days before he stopped breathing to take Ezekiel to a hospital or doctor.  ""It's the Stephans' failure to respond to … increasingly alarming information or feedback from their child during that period of time,"" Crown prosecutor Britta Kristensen said in her closing argument.  ""Both parents knew the child had meningitis.""",health
84,New esports network VENN aims to bring 'gaming as a lens into pop culture',"A new, 24u002F7 esports gaming network called VENN that aims to blend pop culture and gaming was announced on Tuesday, after generating $17 million (all funds US) in seed round funding.  Co-founders Ariel Horn and Ben Kusin told Reuters that the venture will launch sometime in mid 2020 and is angling to be a ""universal network"" with programs like first-run esports events, reality shows, documentaries and game shows.  ""You have this $150 billion-a-year industry that has no TV network,"" said Kusin, former global director of new media at Vivendi Games. ""We are a universal network —that means we will be distributed and consumed anywhere our audience is consuming gaming content.""  Popular esports streaming services like Twitch, which is owned by Amazon, and Mixer, which is owned by Microsoft, are among the platforms VENN is aiming to be distributed on, according to Horn, along with YouTube, Roku, Hulu and Apple TV.  A representative for the company said it is not announcing any streaming agreements yet.  Investors include Kevin Lin, the co-founder of Twitch, and Mike Morhaime and Marc Merrill, the co-founders of Blizzard Entertainment and Riot Games, respectively, among others in the gaming, sports and business industries.    Esports has gained rapid popularity worldwide, drawing top-dollar investments, with global revenue from professional video-game competitions expected to hit $1.1 billion in 2019.  ""We can see that gaming is having a moment,"" said Horn, ""We can tell there's this incredible groundswell around gaming and awareness is at an all-time high.""",entertainment
85,"'How dare you': At UN climate summit, Greta Thunberg slams world leaders in emotional address","Teenage climate change activist Greta Thunberg on Monday opened the United Nations Climate Action Summit with an angry condemnation of world leaders for failing to take strong measures to combat climate change. ""How dare you?"" she said.  Days after millions of young people took to the streets worldwide to demand emergency action on climate change, world leaders gathered at the United Nations in New York City on Monday to try to inject fresh momentum into stalling efforts to curb carbon emissions.  Thunberg, visibly emotional, said in shaky but stern remarks at the opening of the summit that the generations that have polluted the most have burdened her and her generation with the extreme impacts of climate change.  ""This is all wrong. I shouldn't be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you,"" she said.  ""You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words,"" Thunberg said.  Advising world leaders that they'd be watched closely, she added: ""You are failing us, but young people are starting to understand your betrayal.""    UN Secretary General António Guterres has warned governments that they would have to offer action plans to qualify to speak at the summit, which is aimed at boosting the 2015 Paris Agreement to combat global warming.  Leaders including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the one-day gathering, alongside companies working to promote renewable energy.  Merkel said Germany would double its spending to fight climate change to €4 billion ($5.8 billion  Cdn), while Modi pledged to reduce his country's commitment to renewable energy, as well as spending the equivalent of $50 billion Cdn through 2025 to shore up water conservation efforts.  U.S. President Donald Trump, a climate change denier who has undone every major U.S. regulation aimed at fighting climate change, made a brief appearance in the audience of the summit along with Vice-President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Trump listened to the remarks by Modi and Merkel, and then departed.  Former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, detailing his organization's to promote clean energy projects around the globe with willing countries, thanked Trump for showing up and threw a jab the president's way, drawing some laughs.  ""Hopefully our discussions here today will be useful for you when you formulate climate policy,"" said Bloomberg.  Watch: Montreal mayor Plante on how cities can fight climate change    Among the day's other initial announcements was one from the Marshall Islands, whose president, Hilda Heine, said she would seek parliamentary approval to declare a climate crisis on the low-lying atoll, which is already grappling with sea level rise.  Heine said her country and New Zealand, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and others that form the High Ambition bloc at UN climate negotiations will commit to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.  With climate impacts such as extreme weather, thawing permafrost and sea-level rise unfolding much faster than expected, scientists say the urgency of the crisis has intensified since the Paris accord was agreed.    As well, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) unveiled plans to plant urban forests over an area four times the size of Hong Kong, seeking to make Africa and Asia's rapidly growing cities greener.  The initial plan is to support 90 cities in 30 countries in Africa and Asia to create green areas, said FAO director-general Qu Dongyu in a statement. More specific details are expected to be released later in the week.  If managed well, urban forests could reduce air temperatures and cut the cost of air conditioning, the FAO said.   The Paris agreement will enter a crucial implemenation phase next year after another round of negotiations in Chile in December. Pledges made under the agreement are nowhere near enough to avert catastrophic warming, scientists say, and last year carbon emissions hit a record high.  While some countries have made progress, some of the biggest emitting ones remain far behind, even as wildfires, heat waves and record temperatures have provided glimpses of the devastation that could lie in store in a warmer world.  Phase out fossil fuel support, Guterres urges  In a measure of the gap between government action and the ever-louder alarms sounded by climate scientists, the United Nations Development Program said 14 nations representing a quarter of global emissions have signalled that they do not intend to revise current climate plans by 2020.  Over the past year, Guterres has called for no new coal plants to be built after 2020, urged a phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies and asked countries to map out how to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.  ""Is it common sense to give trillions in hard-earned taxpayers' money to the fossil fuel industry to boost hurricanes, spread tropical diseases, and heighten conflict?"" said Guterres in his speech. ""Is it common sense to build ever more coal plants that are choking our future?""  A group of 13 major oil companies charted out a plan on Monday to promote investments in carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS).    Oil chiefs grappling with growing demand for action to fight climate change have looked to invest in carbon-capture and sequestration techniques that some executives, including Occidental Petroleum Corp CEO Vicki Hollub, said could make drilling carbon neutral.  With fossil fuel development growing worldwide, the oil and gas industry faces growing criticism from activists concerned about accelerating climate impacts from melting ice caps to sea-level rise and extreme weather.  The group, formed in 2014 and known as the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI), said it aims to double the amount of carbon dioxide stored globally by 2030. The group is also taking steps to reduce methane emissions.  The companies, which include Exxon Mobil Corp, Chevron Corp and BP PLC, account for 32 per cent of global oil and gas production. They have agreed to co-operate to accelerate reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.  Separately, almost 90 big companies in sectors from food to cement to telecommunications are pledging to slash greenhouse gas emissions, summit organizers said.  'The house is on fire': Protest in D.C.  Trump, in his first few months in office, signalled his intention to pull the United States out of the 2015 Paris accord and has rolled back Obama-era rules on emission cuts and wants to maximize U.S. energy output.  Activists seeking to pressure U.S. politicians to fight climate change blocked major traffic hubs in Washington, D.C. —  chaining themselves to a sailboat in one location — as they sought to draw attention to the summit.    Police arrived with a power saw to free the protesters chained to the boat, draping them with heavy blankets to protect them from flying sparks, and called a truck to haul the boat away.  About 200 protesters chanted nearby: ""It's dire! It's dire! The house is on fire!""  The protest was backed by about two dozen groups, including the Metro D.C. chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America, Extinction Rebellion D.C. and Black Lives Matter D.C.",technology
86,"Tim Hortons pulls Beyond Meat products from Canadian locations outside B.C., Ontario ","Tim Hortons will no longer offer Beyond Meat products at its eateries outside Ontario and B.C.  ""We are always listening to our guests and testing a wide variety of products across the country,"" Restaurant Brands International (RBI), the parent company of Tim Hortons, wrote in an email to CBC News.  ""Both the Beyond Burger and Beyond Meat breakfast sandwiches were introduced as a limited time offer. We have particularly seen positive reaction to our Beyond Meat offering in Ontario and B.C., especially in breakfast, and are proud to offer both alternatives in those regions.""  RBI said the Beyond Burger —  which the chain added to its menu to much fanfare in July — will still be available for a limited time across the country. The Beyond Meat breakfast sandwiches are available in various regions while supplies last, but after that will continue to be sold only in B.C. and Ontario.  The popularity of plant-based products in general, and Beyond Meat in particular, has soared over the past 18 months or so. Just weeks after it started selling its Beyond Meat burger in July 2018, there were reports A&amp;W completely sold out of the product nationwide.  Not long afterwards, Beyond Meat products started popping up at other quick-serve restaurant chains, including Tim Hortons and Subway, as well as grocery stores.  Plant-based eating trend  But plant-based proteins — or even proteins in general — aren't part of the core business of Tim Hortons, said Sylvain Charlebois, director of the Agri-food Analytics Lab, and professor in food distribution and policy at Dalhousie University in Halifax.   ""Timmies is all about coffee, doughnuts and muffins. They just rode on this Beyond Meat bandwagon, and that's dangerous because they tried to capitalize on a brand and not necessarily a product,"" he said.  ""It's like the pizza at McDonald's. It was a disaster back in the '80s because nobody goes to McDonald's to eat pizza.""  Charlebois said his data shows B.C. has the highest rate of veganism in the country and Ontario has the highest rate of vegetarianism, which may explain the decision to continue offering Beyond Meat breakfast sandwiches in those provinces.    ""I was a bit surprised by Quebec because in Quebec, the Beyond Meat product is selling very well in retail stores, but I guess Quebecers just didn't want to buy it in a restaurant,"" said Charlebois.  He said the decision is a blow for Beyond Meat.  ""Beyond Meat's strategy is all about developing channels to connect with the public. They don't spend a dime on publicity or marketing. Zero. They just capitalize in their relationships with franchises in order to sell their products.  ""It's a bit dangerous to do that because if someone pulls [the product], like a major restaurant chain like Tim Hortons, that's going to send the wrong signal to Canadians or to the public.""    Beyond Meat also faces increased competition from other companies, including Impossible Foods, which has a deal with Burger King to sell its plant-based burgers in the U.S. Like Tim Hortons, Burger King is owned by RBI.  Recently, some health experts have questioned Beyond Meat's claims its burgers are healthier than a traditional beef hamburger.  None of this, however, has greatly affected Beyond Meat's stock, which is up more than 500 per cent since its IPO last May.     Beyond Meat shares soar on first day of trading    Charlebois said that's because plant-based foods continue to show impressive growth.  ""I don't think it's the end of plant-based dieting. I think [Tim Hortons] is just re-evaluating its menu. Bear in mind that since RBI bought Tim Hortons, they've been trying all sorts of different products and they've pulled several products. Beyond Meat is just the latest one.""  For its part, Beyond Meat said its products in Tim Hortons locations in Ontario and B.C. ""have seen particularly positive reception.  ""These menu items were introduced as limited time offerings and may be brought back in the future,"" the company said in a statement.  RBI also confirmed that possibility.  ""We may explore offering the product again in other provinces at a future date based on ongoing guest feedback.""",health
87,"Havana syndrome: Exposure to neurotoxin may have been cause, study suggests","The mysterious ailments experienced by some 40 Canadian and U.S. diplomats and their families while stationed in Cuba may have had nothing to do with sonic ""attacks"" identified in earlier studies.   According to a new Canadian study, obtained exclusively by Radio-Canada's investigative TV program Enquête, the cause could instead be neurotoxic agents used in pesticide fumigation.  A number of Canadians and Americans living in Havana fell victim to an unexplained illness starting in late 2016, complaining of concussion-like symptoms, including headaches, dizziness, nausea and difficulty concentrating. Some described hearing a buzzing or high-pitched sounds before falling sick.  In the wake of the health problems experienced over the past three years, Global Affairs Canada commissioned a clinical study by a team of multidisciplinary researchers in Halifax, affiliated with the Brain Repair Centre, Dalhousie University and the Nova Scotia Health Authority.   ""The working hypothesis actually came only after we had most of the results,"" Dr. Alon Friedman, the study's lead author, said in an interview.     Read the full study report here.    The researchers identified a damaged region of the brain that is responsible for memory, concentration and sleep-and-wake cycle, among other things, and then looked at how this region could come to be injured.  ""There are very specific types of toxins that affect these kinds of nervous systems ... and these are insecticides, pesticides, organophosphates — specific neurotoxins,"" said Friedman. ""So that's why we generated the hypothesis that we then went to test in other ways.""  Twenty-six individuals participated in the study, including a control group of people who never lived in Havana.  The researchers — comprised of 15 principal investigators and their teams — conducted a thorough assessment of the Canadians' symptoms, including blood tests and several brain imaging tests.    ""[The results] all support the diagnosis of acquired brain injury in the Canadian diplomats and their families posted in Cuba,"" the study report says.  The scientists were also able to test several of the subjects before and after they returned from Cuba, Friedman noted, and the team saw changes in the brain ""that are definitely due to that time when they were in Havana.""  High dose vs. low dose  The report also examines different scenarios of neurotoxic attacks that occurred in history, including the Tokyo subway sarin gas attack in 1995 and the death of the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Kuala Lumpur in 2017.    It concludes that these cases were the result of high-dose exposures, which is not consistent with what happened in Havana.    The symptoms experienced by the diplomats and their families, rather, are consistent with low-dose exposure, leading researchers to examine the effects of cholinesterase (ChE) blockers in commercial products.  ChE is one of the key enzymes required for the proper functioning of the nervous system. Certain classes of pesticides work by inhibiting ChE.   Cuba, like other tropical countries, regularly sprays pesticides to kill insects that carry infectious diseases.    The researchers found that since 2016, Cuba launched an aggressive campaign against mosquitoes to stop the spread of the Zika virus.  The embassies actively sprayed in offices, as well as inside and outside diplomatic residences — sometimes five times more frequently than usual. Many times, spraying operations were carried out every two weeks, according to embassy records.    Toxicological analysis of the Canadian victims confirmed the presence of pyrethroid and organophosphate — two compounds found in fumigation products.  There was also a correlation between the individuals most affected by the symptoms and the number of fumigations that were performed at their residence.  'Sonic weapons' or mass hysteria?  Since these mysterious Havana symptoms became public in the summer of 2017, the main hypothesis about the source of the attacks has been some kind of unknown weapon using sonic or microwave technology.   With many victims reporting disturbing or even violent noises and pressure in their heads during the onset of symptoms, the idea of an ""acoustic weapon"" seemed plausible.  Another suggested reason for the symptoms — proposed and defended by several scientists — was mass hysteria.    The symptoms experienced by the victims — headaches, hearing loss, cognitive problems, loss of balance, etc. — are frequently found in the general population, these scientists argued, and can be attributed to many causes. They further argued that these symptoms may have pre-existed in the victims, becoming heightened in individuals worried about their safety in Cuba.  While a psychological component cannot be completely ruled out, according to the results of the Dalhousie study, it seems to have played a secondary role.    Cindy Calkin, a psychiatrist and member of the multidisciplinary research team, said she categorically rejects the idea of mass hysteria.  ""I have interviewed all but one or two of [the victims] and I haven't found any evidence of psychiatric disorder. This is a very strong group, very resilient and there is no evidence of mass hysteria,"" she said. ""Part of the diagnostic of mass hysteria is that there is no underlying other medical cause that can be found. And we [found] underlying medical evidence.""  For Friedman, the most important outcome of the study is that the team raised a health issue that likely affects a broader population — beyond the diplomats and their families.   ""We [will] continue the research in other ways to try to confirm which of the toxins is more toxic, at what levels — many things are not known yet,"" he said. ""It's just the beginning of a research, but it's what we're working on now.""    The researchers are now looking to collaborate with Cuban officials to determine whether any Cubans suffered similar brain injuries, as their study only focused on Canadian individuals.   In an email to CBCu002FRadio-Canada, spokesperson John Babcock said that Global Affairs Canada hasn't definitively determined a cause to the mysterious ailments at this point.   ""While we are exploring all avenues, including the research at Dalhousie, no definitive cause of the health incidents has been identified to date,"" he said.

88,"Trudeau has reckoned with the past before, but now it is his own history he must address","Justin Trudeau has embraced the idea that the government of Canada should acknowledge and apologize for its wrongs.  As prime minister, he has officially dealt with some of the most shameful moments in the nation's collective past: the turning away of the Komagata Maru in 1914, the treatment of children in residential schools in Newfoundland and Labrador, the federal government's discrimination against LGBT Canadians, the hanging of six Tsilhqot'in chiefs in 1864, the refusal to accept the the asylum requests of more than 900 German Jews in 1939, the mistreatment of Inuit with tuberculosis several decades ago and the conviction of Chief Poundmaker for treason in 1885.  In the fall of 2017, after Trudeau used a speech to the United Nations General Assembly to confront Canada's painful history of mistreating Indigenous people, the Conservative party asked its supporters in a fundraising email whether they were ""tired of people apologizing for our country's rich history.""  But for all that — for all the wrongdoing and pain Trudeau has addressed — it is something else entirely when the wrongs you are accounting for are your own.  That is immeasurably more difficult.  Trudeau's initial apology on Wednesday night was not enough and not only because another image emerged on Thursday morning. And what he said with his second appearance before the cameras surely won't be the end of this.   But on Thursday — standing on the grass of a city square in downtown Winnipeg, surrounded by a crowd of curious onlookers — he went further, wrestling with himself and trying to account for the inexcusable.    'It was blackface'  First and foremost, he acknowledged the hurt he had caused and the ""racist history of blackface"" that he should have been aware of. When a reporter referred to ""makeup,"" Trudeau corrected him.  ""I appreciate you calling it makeup, but it was blackface. And that is just not right,"" Trudeau said. ""It is something that people who live with the kind of discrimination that far too many people do because of the colour of their skin, or their history or their origins or their religion face on a regular basis and I didn't see that from the layers of privilege that I have.""  One take on Trudeau in his youth, offered by friends, is that he grew up understanding the significance of his last name, knowing that he had to be careful about how he acted and not wanting to embarrass his father. His political career has grown around an idea that he should do something with the advantages he was given.  But he has also shown that he can be a ham. He has a performative streak. He can throw himself down a flight of stairs as a party trick. For Halloween in 2017, he showed up to the House of Commons dressed as Clark Kent and pulled open his shirt to reveal the Superman logo.  And he was unquestionably a child of privilege: raised at 24 Sussex Drive in Ottawa's tony Rockcliffe neighbourhood, educated at Montreal's prestigious Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf and then McGill.  That doesn't excuse anything, but it might be part of an explanation.  ""I have always acknowledged that I come from a place of privilege, but I now need to acknowledge that that comes with a massive blind spot,"" he said.    'I was embarrassed'  Trudeau could not explain why he did it. Nor could he account for precisely when it dawned on him that blackface was wrong. Maybe such things are difficult to pinpoint, but he might be asked again to try.  He also could not say with certainty how many times he did something so insensitive — a politician's hedge against being contradicted later, but a shaky response on a human level.  He faced up to the fact that he hadn't faced up to this before yesterday.  ""I never talked about this,"" he said. ""Quite frankly, I was embarrassed. It was not something that represents the person I've become, the leader I try to be and it was really embarrassing.""  Three years ago or six years ago this could have been offered proactively and addressed as part of his personal evolution. Four weeks short of an election, he risks paying an incredible cost for not having dealt with this earlier.  Asked about Canada's international reputation, Trudeau broadened the conversation to acknowledge systemic discrimination and the very real barriers and pain that racialized Canadians still face.  He might try to place his own story within that history and that reality. Or perhaps it would be better if racialized voices took that lead first. Either way, there is a story to tell.     Not good enough  Trudeau has been strident on issues of diversity — though also capable of restraint, as displayed during a town hall in January — and he might not regret having pushed that message. But he will be pursued by charges of hypocrisy and questions about how the Liberal campaign has pursued the past errors of Conservative candidates. When you claim ideals, you can be punished for not living up to them.  Ultimately the conversation may turn to what his government has done to address discrimination and what more must be done.   ""I've had to reflect on the fact that wanting to do good and wanting to do better simply isn't good enough,"" Trudeau said, ""and you need to take responsibility for mistakes that hurt people who thought I was an ally, who... hopefully many of them still consider me an ally even though this was a terrible mistake.""  Trudeau spoke on Thursday of having to explain himself to his children (and his eyes got red as he recounted that). He called members of his caucus yesterday before Time magazine's story was published. And he spoke privately with Liberal candidates and community leaders before addressing reporters in Winnipeg.  He will need to keep talking and trying to explain.  ""The apologies for things past are important to make sure that we actually understand and know and share and don't repeat those mistakes,"" Trudeau said in 2017, speaking of his government's official acknowledgements.  The past must be reckoned with for the sake of the future — be it the future of Canada, the future of Justin Trudeau, or both.",politics
89,Peeling paint on your white Toyota? Help may be on the way,"Peeling paint has plagued some Toyota owners, and now the automaker says it will do something about it.  But just what it will do is not yet clear.  Toyota Canada told CBC News this week it plans to follow the lead of Toyota USA, which is offering a ""voluntary customer support program"" for owners of affected vehicles.   ""We will be launching a similar support program for impacted customers in Canada,"" Toyota Canada spokesperson David Shum said in an email.  Shum provided no other details, but said that once the program is ready, owners of all affected vehicles will be notified by mail.   The Toyota USA notification went out recently to affected owners in that country.  Vehicles with white paint affected  The company acted in response to reports of peeling paint on certain vehicles with the original factory-applied ""blizzard pearl"" or ""super white"" paint colours.  ""These reports indicate that vehicles with these specific paint colours, applied during the vehicle manufacturing process, may experience paint peeling on exterior metal body parts,""  the notice said.  It said the problem may occur ""when sunlight over time degrades the adhesion between the factory-applied paint primer coat layer and the base metal electrodeposition layer causing the paint to peel from the metal body panel.""  Owners anxious for details  Rachel Mosley, who lives in Prospect, N.S., was the first to bring the story to CBC's attention. Her 2011 RAV4 had small paint peeling spots that continued to grow.  ""I'm not able to wash the vehicle because as soon as I wash it then the paint comes off,"" she said in September 2018.  She complained to Toyota, but like others, was told the warranty on her vehicle had expired.     Mosley is pleased Toyota is finally taking responsibility and said she's looking forward to the details of the program.  Aisha Alam's six-year-old son was the first to notice the paint peeling on her 2013 RAV4 with white ""blizzard pearl"" paint in June.  ""He said 'Mom, your car is broken,'"" said Alam, who lives in Kitchener, Ont.  It was then she noticed that the paint had come off on the driver's side of the vehicle.  ""It's a lot worse now,"" she said. ""There's a huge chunk of paint now missing on the sunroof and there's random places all over where it's just starting to chip.""  'Repaint it properly'  Alam said she spoke with several Toyota representatives and dealerships, and was told by a representative earlier this week that she could ""possibly"" get 50 per cent of the cost of repairing her vehicle.  But she said that was not acceptable.  She's relieved to hear that Toyota will be doing something, and made a suggestion as to what that should be.  ""Toyota should take the whole car and repaint it properly,"" she said, noting the problem is not caused by owners and the peeling isn't isolated to just one area.  Neither Toyota Canada nor Toyota USA has released details of the program.  The mailout to affected customers doesn't say whether vehicles will be completely repainted, whether Toyota will pay the entire bill, or exactly what years and models with the specified white paint will be covered.    It does reference those who previously paid for their own repairs and outlines a process for those customers to be reimbursed, but it doesn't say whether they will get all of their money back or just some of it.  George Iny, director of the Automobile Protection Association ⁠— a consumer advocacy group ⁠— said he is pleased and surprised to hear Toyota Canada plans to repair the vehicles.  ""What we would like to see is lifetime coverage but a one-time repair,"" he said. ""You come in, we look at your vehicle no matter how old it is and we fix it in those areas that one time.""  He said he expects Toyota to pay 100 per cent of the cost to repair damaged areas.  Iny said that because many of the affected vehicles are older, it's important for owners to update their contact information by either going into a dealership or calling Toyota Canada.

90,Major WeWork investor may move to fire its CEO as troubled IPO plans near,"Japan's SoftBank Group Corp, the biggest investor in WeWork owner The We Company, is exploring ways to replace Adam Neumann as chief executive of the U.S. office-sharing start-up, four people familiar with the matter said on Sunday.  The rare showdown between SoftBank and one of its biggest investments comes after We Company postponed its initial public offering (IPO) last week, following pushback from prospective investors, not just over its widening losses, but also over Neumann's unusually firm grip on the company.  This was a blow for SoftBank, which was hoping for We Company's IPO to bolster its profits as it seeks to woo investors for its second $108 billion Vision Fund. It invested in We Company at a $47 billion valuation in January, yet stock market investor skepticism led to the start-up considering a potential valuation in the IPO earlier this month of as low as $10 billion, Reuters reported.  What was the venture capital world's biggest upset is now morphing into one of corporate America's most high-profile boardroom dramas.    Some We Company board directors are deliberating how to replace Neumann as CEO, the sources said. The exact number of directors opposed to Neumann is not clear. Venture capital firm Benchmark Capital, another big investor in We Company, would also like Neumann to step aside, one of the sources said.  Benchmark, SoftBank and Chinese private equity firm Hony Capital each have one representative on We Company's seven-member board, that includes Neumann. Hony Capital's position on whether Neumann should remain CEO could not immediately be learned.  A formally unaffiliated We Company board director, retired Goldman Sachs Group Inc investment banker Mark Schwartz, previously sat on SoftBank's board.  No challenge to Neumann has yet been tabled, the sources said. A We Company board meeting will be held this week, and the issue of his leadership could be raised then, the sources added.  One option that SoftBank is considering is asking Neumann to become interim CEO while a headhunting firm is hired to find an external replacement, the first source said.    The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. We Company and SoftBank declined to comment, while Neumann, Schwartz, Benchmark Capital and Hony Capital could not be immediately reached for comment. The Wall Street Journal first reported on SoftBank exploring ways to replace Neumann as CEO.  As co-founder of the We Company, Neumann holds special voting shares that enable him to dismiss dissident board directors and shoot down any challenge to his authority. However, SoftBank could choose not to back We Company's IPO or provide it with more funding. It has already funded the cash-burning start-up to the tune of $10 billion US, and was discussing committing another $1 billion US to the IPO.  We Company said last week it is aiming to become a publicly traded company by the end of the year.  In a sign of souring relations between SoftBank and WeWork, Neumann did not participate in a gathering of executives of companies backed by SoftBank that took place in Pasadena, California, last week and was organized by SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, according to two people familiar with the matter.  Were a board challenge against Neumann to prove successful, it could follow the template of Uber Technologies Inc.  Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick resigned as CEO of the ride-hailing start-up in 2017 after facing a rebellion from his board over a string of scandals, including allegations of enabling a chauvinistic and toxic work culture. Uber replaced Kalanick with an outsider, former Expedia Group Inc CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, and completed its IPO last May.  Pushing the envelope  It is not uncommon for founders of fast-growing start-ups to be eccentric and control their companies tightly, even as they seek to attract stock market investors. Neumann, however, was criticized by investors and corporate governance experts for arrangements that went beyond the typical practice of having majority voting control through special categories of shares.  These included giving his estate a major say in his replacement as CEO, and tying the voting power of shares to how much he donates to charitable causes.  Neumann also entered into several transactions with We Company over the years, making the company a tenant in some of his properties and charging it rent. He has also secured a $500 million credit line from banks using company stock as collateral.  Following criticism by potential investors, Neumann agreed to some concessions without relinquishing majority control. He agreed to give We Company any profit he receives from real estate deals he has entered in to with the New York-based start-up.  No member of Neumann's family will be on the company's board and any successor will be selected by the board, scrapping a plan for his wife and co-founder, Rebekah Neumann, to help pick the successor.  These changes did little to address concerns about We Company's business model, which rents out workspace to clients under short-term contracts, even though it pays rent for them itself under long-term leases. This mix of long-term liabilities and short-term revenue raised questions among investors about how the company would weather an economic downturn.",business
91,"Canadians' trust in science falling, poll suggests","A survey suggests that the trust Canadians place in science may be eroding.  The survey, by the polling firm Ipsos for the multinational 3M company, also found that nearly half of those surveyed thought scientists are elitist and that a significant number of respondents discounted findings that don't accord with their personal beliefs.  ""While science skeptics represent the minority of Canadians, their number is increasing,"" said Richard Chartrand of 3M Canada. ""This trend is concerning because it shows that distrust is growing.""  The Canadian figures are from a global survey of more than 14,000 people between July and September 2018. It's the second year 3M has done the research.  At a time when accelerating climate change and wildlife loss are placing science at the top of the public agenda, the survey found 32 per cent of respondents were skeptical about it. That was up from 25 per cent the previous year.  ""It moved from one person out of four to one person out of three,"" Chartrand said. ""It's difficult for us to understand why.""  The study's results were conflicting. While doubt was growing, nine out of 10 respondents said they still trusted research results.  Answers to other questions showed that trust to be wary.  Nearly half — 44 per cent — said they considered scientists ""elitists.""  Of those who said they were skeptical of science, about one-third felt scientists were influenced by government agendas. Another third thought science has been swayed by corporate agendas.  And 30 per cent said they only believed science that aligned with their personal beliefs.  Other findings have echoed this survey.  'Depressing but not too surprising'  A 2017 Leger poll for the Ontario Science Centre found 29 per cent of respondents thought that because scientific theories are subject to challenge, they can't be trusted. Another question suggested 43 per cent considered science to be a matter of opinion.  ""It's depressing but not too surprising,"" said John Smol, an ecologist at Queen's University who has written about the issue. ""There's a real disconnect between what scientists do and what is the perception in the public.""  Smol fears Canadians don't understand how science works — that data, not belief, is what counts and that science advances when old beliefs are upended, not shored up by unspoken consensus.  ""There are certainly misconceptions,"" he said. ""You can't blame them. It's a jungle of misinformation out there.""  It's not all the public's fault, said Stephen Johnston, chairman of earth and atmospheric sciences at the University of Alberta.  ""We have to make an effort to communicate in terms that are understandable,"" he said.  ""There used to be an ethic in science that the lower the number of people who actually understood what you did, the better you are doing. That is turning around.""  Smol agreed.  ""We have a real responsibility to make [science] accessible. We're still doing a relatively poor job of translating the data — by and large paid for by taxpayers — and passing it to the public.""    The poll did show curiosity about science. Almost all respondents thought findings should be shared in easily understandable language and 88 per cent wished they knew more about science.  ""I look at these results and think they're quite positive,"" said Johnston. ""People appreciate that science is a necessary thing. There's an insatiable appetite for science.""  The bridge between the public and the lab must be bridged, said Chartrand.  ""There's a clear message in this survey.""",technology
92,Canadian special forces armoured truck stolen in Iraq during Mosul liberation,"Call it a cold case in a hot place.  At the height of the battle to retake Mosul in early 2017, northern Iraq was a sketchy neighbourhood — a place where even broken-down wrecks weren't safe.  Canadian special forces operators were reminded of that fact when one of their armoured pickup trucks was stolen from a training range — a case that left military police scratching their heads.  According to documents obtained by CBC News under access to information law, the theft was reported to the military's criminal investigation branch in March 2017, almost a month after the Toyota Hilux was discovered missing from a range west of Erbil which had been used to train local Kurdish fighters.  According to internal Department of National Defence documents, the vehicle had reached the end of its life cycle and was no longer serviceable.  During the Afghan war, the Canadian army routinely destroyed disabled vehicles to prevent them from falling into insurgent hands — a practice known as ""BIPing"" (Blow in Place).  Pickup stripped of military equipment  That wasn't the policy in Iraq, however. According to the documents, the Hilux was to be used as a ""training aid"" because it had a broken rear hatch, a damaged right door and ""major drivetrain issues.""  The pickup had been stripped of Canadian radios, electronics and other military equipment, said an April 12, 2017, summary of the military police investigation.  The special forces contingent left it unattended on the training range on Feb. 4, 2017. They learned it had disappeared 10 days later when they arrived back in the area after a forward deployment assisting Iraqi security forces as they fought a prolonged battle with entrenched Islamic State militants in Mosul.    ""Security measures had been arranged but as the vehicle had been demilitarized and was to be used for training purposes, it could be left unattended on the range,"" said Dan LeBouthillier, a Department of National Defence spokesman.  The documents noted the pickup was carried to the range on a flatbed truck.  The theft was the only incident of its kind during the Canadian advise-and-assist training mission in Iraq, LeBouthillier said.  The documents show military police interviewed Kurdish commanders and local fighters, all of whom claimed ignorance about the missing truck.  Looking for suspects  At times, the partially redacted internal reports read like a dark comedy as they describe how a pair of investigators navigated the dangerous and surreal landscape looking for suspects and traces of the vehicle.  Interviews were conducted through a translator and were sometimes sidelined by the capricious timetable of some Kurdish commanders — one of whom didn't show up for his interview and had to be reached by phone at an undisclosed location.  ""He did not have any new information on the missing vehicle's location, nor did he identify any possible suspects,"" said the report, which did not identify the Kurdish commander.   ""He will canvas his troops on the matter.""  One Canadian soldier, whose name was blanked out in the documents, said he searched local scrap yards and ""believes the vehicle may have been taken by local farmers or inhabitants to eventually sell it for parts in the scrap yard.""    Military officials were most concerned about the fact that the vehicle still contained its armour plating, which was slipped between the pickup frame and the interior.  The theft came at a time when Islamic State extremists were known to be building massive suicide trucks using scrap metal bolted to ordinary vehicles.  In 2016-17, multiple U.S. media reports warned that ISIS mechanics were skilled in creating ""professional-grade"" armoured vehicles out of scrap.  However, the unidentified Canadian soldier told investigators ""the probability of the [pickup] being taken by the enemy is very negligible"" because the range was located near Kurdish checkpoints, who would have spotted it being stolen.  The investigation ended, according to the documents, with no suspects, no forensic evidence and no vehicle.",politics
93,Colt suspends production of AR-15 rifle for civilian market,"Gun-maker Colt is suspending its production of rifles for the civilian market including the popular AR-15, the company said Thursday in a shift it attributed to changes in consumer demand and a market already saturated with similar weapons.  The company said it will focus instead on fulfilling contracts with military and police customers for rifles.  ""The fact of the matter is that over the last few years, the market for modern sporting rifles has experienced significant excess manufacturing capacity,"" Colt's CEO, Dennis Veilleux, said in a written statement. ""Given this level of manufacturing capacity, we believe there is adequate supply for modern sporting rifles for the foreseeable future.""  Veilleux said the company, which emerged from bankruptcy in 2016, remains committed to the right to bear arms, as spelled out in the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. He said the company is expanding its lines of pistols and revolvers.  Despite a national debate on gun control, Colt's decision seems driven by business considerations rather than politics, said Adam Winkler, a gun policy expert at the University of California, Los Angeles School of Law.  FBI statistics show more than 2.3 million people applied for background checks to purchase guns in August, up from just over 1.8 million in July. Those applications, the best available statistic from tracking gun sales, have been rising steadily, with a slight decline after Donald Trump was elected president in 2016, something called the ""Trump slump.""  Gun sales usually go up when gun buyers feel their access to such weapons is being threatened, Winkler said.    ""Given these sales and the history of Colt being a completely disorganized, dysfunctional company that goes into bankruptcy and can't keep anything going properly, my assumption is that this is a business decision that is being driven by their own business problems,"" he said.  Still, Winkler said the company's decision risks alienating and angering its remaining customer base.  ""We've seen in the past that when gun manufacturers are viewed to have given in to gun-safety advocates, gun owners will boycott them and really hurt their business,"" he said. ""If they think a company like Colt is disrespecting their identity or giving in to the other side, Colt's likely going to see serious damage to its other firearms brands too.""  The debate on gun control has focused in particular on assault-style rifles like AR-15s that have been used in mass shootings.  Democratic presidential candidate and former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke, whose hometown of El Paso was the site of a shooting in August left 22 people dead, has been pushing for mandatory rifle buybacks over the last few weeks.    ""Hell, yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47, and we're not going to allow it to be used against your fellow Americans anymore,"" O'Rourke said, during a Democratic presidential debate this month.  The parents of a young woman killed in the 2017 Las Vegas massacre filed a wrongful death lawsuit in July against Colt and seven other gun manufacturers, along with gun shops in Nevada and Utah, arguing their weapons are designed to be easily modified to fire like automatic weapons.  In Connecticut, gun-maker Remington is facing a lawsuit involving liability for the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in which a Bushmaster AR-15-style rifle used to kill 20 first graders and six educators on Dec. 14, 2012.",business
94,What would happen if Justin Trudeau resigned mid-campaign?,"The first photo of Justin Trudeau in blackface makeup was released Wednesday, Sept. 18. Within hours, more photos surfaced of Trudeau dressed up with a darkened face.  When pressed the next day to state whether there were any more such images, Trudeau said, ""I am wary of being definitive about this.""  How many photos do we know of?  There are least three photos and one video of Trudeau wearing racist makeup.  The story broke the evening of Wednesday, Sept. 18 with the publication by Time Magazine of a photo from a 2001 yearbook from the Vancouver private school West Point Grey Academy, where Trudeau taught. The school staged an Arabian Nights-themed gala. Trudeau dressed as Aladdin, in blackface and a turban.  Time reported that it obtained the photo from Vancouver businessman Michael Adamson, who was identified as being ""part of the West Point Grey Academy community.""    A second photo from the same gala surfaced later Wednesday evening. It had been printed in the school's newsletter.    Trudeau was asked on Wednesday by CBC reporter David Cochrane if there were any other, similar incidents he should divulge. Trudeau said there was one other incident, dating from when he was in a high school talent show at Montreal's Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf. He wore blackface to sing Harry Belefonte's hit Day O (Banana Boat Song).    The next day, Global News released a video it obtained of Trudeau, again in blackface. It came from an unidentified event, but the Liberal Party confirmed that it was indeed Trudeau in the 1990s. Global reported it obtained the video from a source in the Conservative Party.    How did Trudeau react?  Trudeau held an emergency news conference Wednesday evening on his campaign plane. He apologized and said he ""should have known better.""  ""I take responsibility for my decision to do that. I shouldn't have done it,"" he said. ""I should have known better. It was something that I didn't think was racist at the time, but now I recognize it was something racist to do and I am deeply sorry.""  Watch his full apology and answers to reporter questions:    What would happen if Trudeau resigned mid-campaign?  It would be an unprecedented event in Canadian politics — so political scientists have been mulling over how it might play out.  They all point to the Liberal Party's constitution — which outlines what happens when a leader resigns and an interim needs to be chosen — rather than the Elections Act. A leader dropping out mid-campaign is not explicitly mentioned in the party's constitution. One section does give some guidance, though: it states the national board of directors would appoint an interim leader in consultation with caucus.  But dealing with a caucus becomes tricky after Parliament is dissolved. Kelly Blidook, who teaches political science at Newfoundland's Memorial University, said he thinks the board ""technically"" could name an interim leader without caucus consultation.  ""But I am reasonably certain in such a case that there would be a selective consultation of senior or longtime elected Liberals,"" he wrote in an email.  The timeline would be incredibly tight, though — maybe impossible.  ""There is simply not enough time to formally select a new leader during the campaign,"" said Matthew Kerby, who has taught political science at Memorial and the University of Ottawa and now teaches at Australian National University.  ""Strategically, it would be a terrible idea as it would leave the party rudderless and would also be a tacit admission of defeat before election day.""  What has Trudeau said about resigning?  Asked Wednesday evening if he should resign as Liberal leader, Trudeau argued that incidents like these should be approached on a ""case-by-case"" basis.  ""There are people who make mistakes in this life and you make decisions based on what they actually do, what they did and on a case-by-case basis. I deeply regret that I did that. I should have known better, but I didn't,"" he said.  Asked on Thursday if he'd considered stepping aside to let someone else lead the party through the election, Trudeau did not answer directly but said he would ""continue to do the work that is necessary to keep us moving forward in the right way.""    How did the other leaders react?  Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer: A few hours after the first photo surfaced, Scheer said he was extremely shocked and disappointed.  ""Wearing brownface is an act of open mockery and racism. It was just as racist in 2001 as it is in 2019,"" he said. ""And what Canadians saw this evening was someone with a complete lack of judgment and integrity and someone who is not fit to govern this country.""  NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh: Singh said Trudeau's behaviour was ""troubling"" and ""insulting.""   ""It's making a mockery of someone for what they live and what their lived experiences are,"" he said. ""I think he needs to answer for it. I think he needs to answer the question why he did that and what does that say about what he thinks about people who, because of who they are, because of the colour of their skin, face challenges and barriers and obstacles in their life.""  Singh said it's not up to him to say whether Trudeau should be prime minister, leaving that decision to voters.  Green Party Leader Elizabeth May: May tweeted Wednesday night that she was deeply shocked.    On Thursday, she said, she does not believe Trudeau is racist. ""At that point in his life, I think you'd have to say he was unconsciously racist. I would not say today the man I know is a racist. But I could not imagine that photo, either.""  Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet: Blanchet said Thursday that he is ""sincerely convinced"" that Trudeau is not a racist.  ""But I am as much sincerely convinced that it shows, or his reaction shows, or his lack of anticipation of this problem shows that he does not have the required qualities to be the prime minister of a country being a member of the G7.""  People's Party Leader Maxime Bernier: Bernier tweeted Wednesday that he wasn't going to accuse Trudeau of being a racist but he did think ""he was the biggest hypocrite in the country.""  ""He's the master of identity politics and the [Liberals] just spent months accusing everyone of being white supremacists.""  How did the Liberal Party react?  The Liberal Party confirmed that all the photos and the video were of Justin Trudeau, but did not issue an official statement.  How have Liberal candidates reacted?  Greg Fergus, a black Liberal MP seeking re-election in Hull-Aylmer, Que., said Trudeau should be judged on his ""great record"" on promoting equality and diversity, not on things that happened nearly 20 years in the past.  ""I think those are really the measure of the man and that's the reason why I have confidence in his continuing leadership,"" he said.  Watch Fergus and other Liberal MPs of colour react:    Omar Alghabra, who is seeking re-election as a Liberal MP for Mississauga Centre, said his heart sank when he saw the photos.   ""The person I know of Justin Trudeau for the last seven or eight years is a champion against intolerance and racism. Not just lip service, but with real deeds and real action. That is the Justin Trudeau I know. I can't explain those pictures.""  Amarjeet Sohi, who served as natural resources minister and is seeking re-election in Edmonton Mill Woods, issued a strong statement condemning the images.  ""I was very disheartened and disappointed to see these images. These indefensible images bring back many painful memories of racism that I and other racialized Canadians have experienced throughout their lives,"" he said.    Catherine McKenna, who served as environment and climate change minister under Trudeau, said what the Liberal leader did was a mistake but she would not be running if she didn't believe in him.  Watch McKenna explain why she is standing behind him:    Trudeau said that when he darkened his face 20 years ago, he did not realize it was a racist act. He said he recognizes now that it is.  But many Canadians have said that they don't consider it racist and that it was just part of a costume.  This article explains why wearing brownface or blackface is considered ""reprehensible.""",politics
95,"Thousands of young people hospitalized due to cannabis and other substance use, report reveals","About 65 young people in Canada per day land in hospital because of harm caused by cannabis, alcohol, opioids and other substances, according to a new report.  Clinicians and a former user say the findings from the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) highlight the desperate need for more community supports to help those with mental health concerns.  The institute released the report, titled ""Hospital stays for harm caused by substance use among youth age 10 to 24,"" on Thursday. The figures present a snapshot of the hospital stays in those age groups in 2017-2018, before the legalization of cannabis.  Last year, more than 23,500 youth were hospitalized for harm from substance use, the report says. In comparison, about 8,000 were hospitalized for illnesses related to the appendix.   The findings highlight the need to focus attention on youth who experience harm caused by substance use and have mental health conditions occurring at the same time, as well as those who live in lower-income or rural and remote areas, the report's authors said.  Cannabis accounted for nearly 40 per cent of those hospital stays among youth, followed by alcohol-related hospitalizations at about 26 per cent.  Missed opportunities  Dr. Joanna Henderson, a psychologist and senior scientist at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto, says the report shows perspectives on substance abuse need to expand, especially when nearly 70 per cent of the hospitalizations for harm caused by substance use involve mental health conditions, as well.  That's nearly double the proportion among those aged 25 and older.  ""We need adequate services in the hospital but we also need to be thinking about how are we intervening sooner,"" said Henderson, who was not involved in the research.     ""We are missing opportunities like schools, local malls … where young people are.""  Young people need places in communities that are one-stop shops to connect them with employment, education, housing and health services, including mental health and substance use, she said.  'You're not alone'  Lucas Wade, 31, first started smoking cannabis at 17 ""out of peer pressure,"" he said.  At age 20, he was toking daily for pleasure along with boozing.   ""I was admitted to hospital after my roommate found me after trying to suicide because I couldn't stop smoking pot, no matter what,"" Wade said. ""I couldn't keep living that way.""  Wade ended up homeless when a landlord evicted him for smoking indoors after signing a contract saying he wouldn't.    Wade studied social work and now works as a support counselor in Toronto, where he sees many youth with underlining mental health issues using substances as a coping mechanism.  The first step is to talk to someone close to you, such as a best friend, parent or sibling, Wade said.  ""If you're the youth, find a safe space or people where you can share and talk about this stuff because it is so hard. When you're in the throes of it, you feel so alone. You're not alone.""  Previous research suggests young people with pre-existing mental health concerns can be at higher risk for problematic substance use and it occur in the other direction as well, Henderson said.  It's important not only to collect consistent data across Canada regularly to find any changes but to speak to young people about their experience with how services are delivered, she added.    About 17 per cent of the youth were hospitalized more than once in the same fiscal year, according to CIHI. That's another red flag for the need for better community supports, clinicians say.  Hospitalization rates varied by province and territory. The hospital stays are ""the tip of the iceberg when it comes to estimating harm caused by substance use,"" CIHI said, and doesn't include fatal overdoses in the community.

96,9 gripe water brands recalled because of microbial contamination,"Various brands of gripe water used to treat stomach upset in babies are under recall because of potential microbial contamination, Health Canada said.  RW Consumer Products Ltd. is recalling all lots of the product ""Gripe Water – Alcohol And Preservative Free"" after the company's testing showed contamination.  The brand names include:     Shoppers Drug Mart's Life Brand.   The Walmart brand Equate.   Rexall's brand Be Better.   Pharmasave.   Atoma.   Baby's Choice.   Personnelle.   Teddy's Choice.   Western Family    Stores across Canada sold the recalled products, which carry the Natural Product Number or NPN 80080669.    These products are marketed as a ""gentle antacid for quick relief of baby's minor stomach upsets such as colic, cramps, gas, sour stomach, and hiccups especially during teething.""  Health Canada said ingesting a contaminated product may pose serious health risks. Microbial contamination can increase the risk of infection, particularly in infants. Their developing immune systems may be more susceptible to infection.  Symptoms of a microbial infection in infants include:     Vomiting and watery diarrhea.   Fever.   Abdominal pain.    The regulator advised consumers to stop giving affected products to your baby.  Health Canada also suggested consult a health-care professional if a baby used the product and you have concerns about the child's health.  Consumers are asked to return any unused product to the place of purchase.  Health Canada will monitor the company's recall and inform Canadians if new safety information becomes available.",health
97,Saudi energy minister says oil production will be back to normal by end of September,"Saudi Arabia's new energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said Tuesday that his country's oil market will be fully back online by the end of September.  Speaking at a press conference in Jeddah Tuesday, Prince Abdulaziz said production would be at 9.890 million barrels per day in October. He also said that 50 per cent of the production cut resulting from a recent drone attack has already been restored.  The kingdom sought to calm markets on Tuesday after an unprecedented attack on its oil facilities, with sources saying output was recovering much more quickly than initially forecast and could be fully back in two or three weeks.  Saturday's attacks raised the spectre of a major supply shock in a market that in recent months has been preoccupied with demand concerns and faltering global growth. Oil surged as much as 20 per cent at one point on Monday.  Brent crude was down $3.72 US, or 5.4 per cent, at $65.30 a barrel by 8:50 a.m. ET. West Texas Intermediate was down $2.40, or 3.8 per cent, at $60.50 a barrel.  In the immediate fallout from the attacks, state-owned producer Saudi Aramco told some Asian refiners it would meet its oil commitments, albeit with changes, sources said.      We need a proper damage assessment, we need to see a recovery plan.  — Samuel Ciszuk, analyst     ""All eyes will be on the Saudi news conference,"" said Samuel Ciszuk, founding partner at Stockholm-based ELS Analysis.  ""We need a proper damage assessment, we need to see a recovery plan. Before that, we don't really know how much oil will be offline for how long, and that's the basic question people having been posing since Saturday.""  Biggest single oil disruption in 50 years  The attacks on crude-processing facilities at Abqaiq and Khurais resulted in the largest single supply disruption in half a century, and threw into question Saudi Arabia's status as supplier of last resort.  Some Asian refineries are expected to receive their allocated volumes for October, while other importers are being told of delays or being offered alternative grades.    The prospect of oil releases from strategic inventories in the United States, the International Energy Agency and countries such as Japan have weighed on prices, but the geopolitical threat of retaliation is causing concerns.  U.S. Vice-President Mike Pence said on Tuesday the United States was evaluating evidence on the attacks and stands ready to defend its interests and allies in the Middle East.  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was travelling to Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, Pence said in a speech at the Heritage Institute think-tank. If Iran conducted Saturday's attacks to pressure U.S. President Donald Trump to back off his sanctions regime against Tehran, they will fail, Pence said.    Relations between the United States and Iran have deteriorated since Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear accord last year and reimposed sanctions on its oil exports.    Tehran rejects the charges it was behind the strikes and on Tuesday ruled out talks with Trump. Saudi King Salman meanwhile called on governments around the world to confront the threats to oil supplies.  Washington also wants to pressure Tehran to end its support for regional proxy forces, including in Yemen where Saudi forces have been fighting Iran-backed Houthis for four years. The Houthis claimed responsibility for Saturday's attacks.

98,"2nd Ebola vaccine to be used in Congo, as UN efforts slammed","The World Health Organization on Monday announced Congo will start using a second experimental Ebola vaccine, as efforts to stop the deadly outbreak are stalled and Doctors Without Borders criticizes vaccination efforts to date.  Since this outbreak was declared in August 2018, more than 200,000 people have received doses of a vaccine made by Merck which will continue to be used in Congo. The U.N. health agency in a statement said the second vaccine, made by Johnson &amp; Johnson, will be used from October in areas where Ebola is not actively spreading.  Using the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine ""will ensure that we have potentially an additional tool to prevent the expansion of the outbreak,"" said Matshidiso Moeti, WHO's Africa director.  So far, more than 3,030 people have been sickened by the Ebola virus in this outbreak, the second-worst in history, and more than 1,990 have died.  The question of whether the Johnson &amp; Johnson experimental vaccine should be used was at the centre of a dispute between Congo's former health minister, Dr. Oly Ilunga and global health officials. Ilunga had insisted Congo would not use the vaccine because he said it wasn't sufficiently tested and would create confusion.  He resigned as the health minister in July after the president replaced him as the head of Congo's Ebola response team. In his resignation letter, Ilunga criticized the ""strong pressure exercised in recent months"" to use the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.    Separately, Doctors Without Borders is seeking an independent committee to oversee Ebola vaccination efforts, similar to those that have been formed internationally to respond to outbreaks of meningitis, yellow fever and cholera.  The medical charity said greater transparency is needed and alleged that WHO is ""restricting the availability"" of the Merck vaccine in the field. Doctors Without Borders, also known by its French acronym, MSF, said the approximately 225,000 people vaccinated so far is ""largely insufficient"" and that between 450,000 and 600,000 people should have been immunized by now.  ""Not enough people are getting the vaccine because of some arbitrary rules that haven't been made clear,"" Dr. Natalie Roberts, emergency co-ordinator for MSF, told The Associated Press.    She said restricting the vaccine to people who are known contacts of Ebola cases is problematic. ""It comes down to very local control, when every morning it's someone from WHO who decides who is going to be vaccinated and how many vials to open,"" she said. ""Trying to restrict eligibility for a vaccine for a disease that everybody is afraid of is just not going to work.""  MSF has described WHO's strategy as ""like giving firefighters a bucket of water to put out a fire, but only allowing them to use one cup of water a day.""  WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said in an email that the limited number of Ebola vaccines needs to be used sparingly.    ""If all doses were sent to (Congo), there would be no reserves available to respond should cases emerge in any of the high-risk neighbouring countries,"" he said.  ""That would jeopardize an effective, speedy response in those high-risk countries."" Beyond Congo, cases have been confirmed in Uganda and some health workers in Rwanda and South Sudan have been vaccinated preventively.  Jasarevic said an international committee like the one called for by MSF is only used for licensed vaccines; both Ebola vaccines remain experimental and have not been approved by any regulatory agencies.    ""When the vaccine is licensed, this would be an appropriate mechanism for managing supply of the vaccine,"" he said.  Roberts said the number of people vaccinated so far is ultimately a damning assessment of response efforts.  ""If you had said at the beginning of the outbreak that we were going to vaccinate this many people, you would assume the outbreak would be over by now,"" she said. ""But clearly the right people were not vaccinated.""",health
99,Conservatives will review business subsidies in effort to save $1.5 billion,"Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said Wednesday he will start to pay for his promised $9 billion in tax cuts and program spending by finding a way to cut $1.5 billion from annual subsidies to Canadian corporations.  Scheer spent most of Wednesday campaigning at small businesses in Hamilton and Richmond Hill, Ont., trying to drill home his campaign theme of helping the little guy rather than the rich and well-connected. He went first to a barbershop and later to a Chinese bakery.  ""Hard-working Canadians are rightly offended when they see their tax dollars going to further the interests of the wealthy and well-connected friends while Justin Trudeau makes them pay more for gasoline, groceries, and home heating,"" Scheer said.  He said a Conservative government will review all federal business subsidies and eliminate economic-development programs in which the funds benefit shareholders, corporate executives, foreign companies, lobbyists or consultants. Those subsidies and programs total $7 billion now, he said, scattered among numerous departments.  The Conservatives would protect regional economic-development agencies, however, and make sure they're administered by ministers from those regions. They'd also give support to ""strategic industries,"" such as aerospace, if the money stays in the country and creates or protects jobs.    He cited a $12-million subsidy the government gave grocery giant Loblaw to buy more energy-efficient coolers as one example of an expense Conservatives wouldn't support.  Scheer said the Conservatives would have never spent federal funds in other ways the Liberals have, including $220 million to buy energy-efficient gas turbines for the Canada LNG project in British Columbia, and the $4.5-billion purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline.  Infrastructure bank called 'boondoggle in waiting'  He also is gunning for what he called the $35-billion ""boondoggle in waiting"" Canada Infrastructure Bank. The bank is meant to use federal money to spark private investments in things like new highways, bridges and water systems, helping to find projects that could eventually spin off revenue to pay those investments back.  The Tories submitted the promise to the parliamentary budget officer, as they have others; the office said this is not the type of proposal the office can assess.  This is the first announcement Scheer has made in the week-old campaign in which he's talked about cutting government spending rather than forgoing revenue. The Conservatives have thus far pledged tax credits, cuts and grants exceeding $9 billion, which Scheer has said he will pay for by having different priorities from the Liberal government.  John Lester, a former federal government economist who now works as an executive fellow at the University of Calgary's School of Public Policy, said in a 2018 paper that there were about $14 billion in federal government business subsidies in 2014-15. The paper said Ottawa and the four largest provinces in Canada provided $29 billion in subsidies through program spending, mostly through the tax system, with Alberta leading the way at $600 per capita corporate handouts.  The total amount was about half of what the provinces and Ottawa collected in corporate income taxes.  The federal government has been promising under both the former Conservative government and the recent Liberal one to cancel federal fossil fuel subsidies — worth more than $3.3 billion a year — as part of a pledge of all G20 nations to do so. Despite the decade-old promise that Canada has recommitted to every year since, the subsidies have not been cut.  Canada recently joined with Argentina to conduct peer reviews of each other subsidies in a bid to figure out the path to eliminating them.",politics
100,Airbnb to become publicly traded company next year,"Short-term rental company Airbnb says it plans to go public next year and list its shares on the stock exchange.  The company made the announcement in a news release on Thursday, but declined to offer any details about what stock exchange it would list on or how much money it plans to raise in the process.  It would make the company the latest in the so-called ""sharing economy"" to make the move to go public, following ride-hailing firms Uber and Lyft, and the forthcoming initial public offering (IPO) by office space company WeWork later this year.  The IPOs of Uber and Lyft slumped after going public, with investors questioning the two companies' growth potential along with lack of profitability.  WeWork has similarly been hit hard by scrutiny over its finances and fears the company may never turn a profit.  Airbnb, which allows online rental bookings of unused rooms and properties to people looking for short-term stays, has disrupted the hotel and tourism industry in the decade since it was founded in San Francisco in 2008.  Users of Airbnb pay property owners for their short-term stays, similar to the way hotels work, and the company takes a percentage of each deal as its fee.  This week, the company said it took in more than $1 billion US in revenue for the second quarter of 2019, but has declined to say if it is profitable. It has previously said its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization was positive for 2017 and 2018.  The company has also faced backlash in numerous places where it operates. It has been accused of helping property owners avoid paying income taxes on rental income and disrupting rental market balances, and has been accused of fraud and abuse.",business
101,'I was extremely disappointed': Jody Wilson-Raybould responds to Trudeau brownface controversy,"Jody Wilson-Raybould, who was kicked out of the Liberal party caucus in the fallout to the SNC-Lavalin affair, said she was ""extremely disappointed"" after seeing a photo of Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau dressed in brownface.  The photo, published Wednesday in Time Magazine, shows Trudeau dressed up in brownface and a turban in 2001 for a gala at West Point Grey Academy, a private school in Vancouver's west side where he once worked.  ""It's awful,"" Wilson-Raybould told reporters at a campaign rally Wednesday evening. ""When I first saw it, I didn't think it was real.  ""But I will say I'm incredibly proud to be an Indigenous person in this country, one that has experienced racism and discrimination. It's completely unacceptable for anybody in a position of authority and power to do something like that.""    The campaign rally Wednesday also featured Jane Philpott, the former health minister who Trudeau also turfed from his caucus in April.   Philpott's expulsion came after she resigned from the Liberal cabinet and publicly stated she had lost confidence in how the Trudeau government was handling the SNC-Lavalin affair.  Both women are now running as independent candidates.  The two were greeted by more than 200 supporters at the Hellenic Community Centre, just a few kilometres from the private school where Trudeau once worked.  ""It was very disturbing to see the photo for a whole variety of reasons,"" Philpott said.     ""It's the act of racism as well as the fact it's been hidden all these years. Those are concerning things. The position of prime minister is a position of high esteem and we expect the very best of our leaders.""    Green Party Leader Elizabeth May made a surprise appearance at the rally to support both candidates. When asked if she thought Trudeau was racist, May said much of the racism in Canada is unconscious.  ""At that point in his life, I think you'd have to say he was unconsciously racist,"" May said of Trudeau. ""I would not say today the man I know is a racist. But I could not imagine that photo either.""  May noted that the Liberal leader quickly apologized for the brownface incident, but has yet to apologize to Wilson-Raybould after Canada's ethics commissioner found Trudeau inappropriately tried to influence Wilson-Raybould when she was attorney general.",politics
102,An old photo of Stephen Harper in Indigenous garb is being misrepresented online,"In the wake of Liberal leader Justin Trudeau's blackface scandal, an image of Stephen Harper is being shared online showing the former prime minister wearing an Indigenous headdress and face paint.  Those posting the images are attempting to draw parallels between the images of Trudeau wearing blackface makeup and the photo of Harper. But Harper wasn't wearing a costume at the time — he was taking part in a ceremony naming him an honorary chief.    In 2011, Harper was given the ceremonial title by the Blood Tribe in southern Alberta. As part of the ceremony, Blood Tribe elder Pete Standing Alone painted Harper's face and placed a headdress of eagle feathers on his head.  The title is considered a great honour and has been bestowed upon other world leaders, including Prince Charles and Pope John Paul II. In 2016, Trudeau himself was given an aboriginal name by the Tsuut'ina First Nation during a ceremony that saw him presented with a traditional headdress, which he subsequently wore.  But many people are sharing the photo of Harper on Facebook and Twitter without this context. One Facebook post of the photo, which has been shared more than 5,600 times, includes the caption: ""Stephen Harper is astounded at Trudeaus [sic] racist costume from 20 years ago ...""    ""The chiefs chose to put a headdress on Harper and they brought in people from their faith and they coloured his face. It was all part of a cultural and religious ceremony,"" said Robert Jago a Montreal-based writer and a member of the Kwantlen First Nation.  ""When you point to that and you point at the colour on his face and you laugh at it, you're not laughing at Harper. You're laughing at the people that put the colour there.""  Jago tweeted about the image over the weekend after seeing it shared by several people on Facebook. He said there's a stark difference between the photo of Harper at that ceremony and the images of Trudeau wearing blackface.   ""People are partisans and don't really appreciate what the actual issue is, or they don't want to engage with it, so they'd rather deflect and say, 'Everybody does this,'"" Jago said.  ""But if you're saying that participating in a ceremony from another religion or another culture is the same as Trudeau's minstrel acts, you are being really cruel towards minorities, and sharing the same level of ignorance that Trudeau says he got over after 2001.""",politics
103,Trudeau promises more financial supports for seniors — but no independent accounting,"The Liberals are offering new financial supports for seniors — but no independent analysis of how much they would cost Canadians.  During a campaign event in Fredericton, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau announced that a re-elected government led by him would provide a 10 per cent boost to Old Age Security (OAS) at age 75 and a 25 per cent increase to the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) for widows.  According to the Liberal Party, the OAS increase would give Canadians aged 75 and older an extra $729 each year and lift 20,000 seniors out of poverty.  The increase would take effect in July 2020 and would be indexed to keep up with inflation. The full value of the benefit would be received by every senior who makes less than $77,580 today.  Widows or widowers would receive up to $2,080 in additional benefits every year with the increased survivor's benefit under the CPP and Quebec Pension Plan (QPP).    Asked if Canadians would be required to pay higher premiums to pay for the increase, Trudeau did not provide a clear answer.  ""That's a conversation that we're going to be having with the provinces,"" he said.    Trudeau said losing a partner is one of the hardest things to endure, and this added support will help during the period of grief.  ""Seniors have built the Canada that we know and love today. And they deserve to enjoy their golden years to the fullest,"" Trudeau said during a campaign event in Fredericton.  Dan Kelly, president and CEO of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, warned that the boost in CPP could come at a big cost.  ""CPP premiums are already set to rise by 20 per cent over the next few years. Canadians should be informed of the costs of the new Liberal Party promise to boost survivors' pensions. This could be a big one and cost jobs. Also, seven provinces would need to agree before it goes ahead,"" Kelly said in a statement to CBC.  One national seniors' advocacy group applauded the measures. The Canadian Association for Retired Persons (CARP) said a survey of its members found 64 per cent were worried about outliving their savings in retirement.  ""Seniors poverty is a growing concern. The Liberals' proposed OAS increase would make a real difference to Canada's poorest seniors. And the proposed increase to the CPP survivor benefit is critically important to income security, especially for widowed women,"" CARP said in a statement.  According to background materials, the Liberal Party estimates the OAS increase would cost $1.63 billion in 2020-21, rising to $2.56 billion in 2023-24.  No independent costing  Costing analysis by the Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO) was not provided.  Trudeau is facing criticism for not providing the independent analysis of Liberal platform commitments, as the Conservatives and NDP have been doing. Today, he said only some parts of the platform would be subjected to the PBO's scrutiny.  ""We will be releasing a fully costed, fully responsible platform in the coming weeks, including all the work done by the Parliamentary Budget Officer on specific measures,"" he said.  The Liberals extended the mandate of the PBO to cost party platforms during election campaigns. The Liberals made a campaign promise in 2015 to ""help Canadians make informed decisions during elections"" and give Canadians a ""credible, non-partisan way to compare each party's fiscal plans.""  All requests for PBO cost analysis come from the parties, and the service is not mandatory.  Something to hide?  But Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said Trudeau's decision not to release costing with each campaign commitment, as his party has done, shows he has something to hide.  ""Obviously the Liberals have a terrible fiscal record that they are ashamed of,"" Scheer said during a campaign event in Hamilton, Ont. ""I believe that's why they're not participating in the very process that they themselves set up.""    Asked if the volume of requests has caused any delay or backlog, Sloane Mask, PBO's director of parliamentary relations and planning, told CBC this week the PBO ""is meeting the current demand"" for requests. The timing of the release of platform costing is up to the parties, she said.  If the PBO is unable to complete a cost estimate, the request and the reason it could not be completed will be published on its website, Mask said.  Speaking about the new election costing mandate this spring, PBO Yves Giroux said the initiative will give political parties more certainty and boost their credibility.  ""But the main advantage will be for Canadians. Canadians will have enhanced reassurance that there is a non-partisan and professional organization that provides cost estimates for political parties' engagements,"" he said.  'Pretty words'  The NDP criticized Trudeau's track record on seniors' issues, pointing to thousands of retirees whose pensions were cut due to a lack of protections after Sears Canada's bankruptcy, and those seniors now without dental care and prescription coverage.  ""At election time, Justin Trudeau gives us some pretty words but then gives tax breaks to the rich instead of doing the right thing for people. We'll protect pensions and take action on prescription drugs and dental care. That's what seniors deserve,"" said a statement from the NDP.  The Conservatives said Liberal policies have made life less affordable for seniors, citing the carbon tax and the cancellation of the transit tax credit. Scheer is promising to help seniors by introducing a universal tax cut, cancelling the carbon tax and removing the GST from home heating.  ""Justin Trudeau cannot be trusted to deliver for Canadian seniors. In 2015, Trudeau promised seniors he would create a seniors price index but he did nothing for four years and abandoned that plan. Now that he needs your vote, he's making even more promises that he won't keep,"" said a statement from the Conservative Party.",politics
104,"Champion of diversity or high-profile hypocrite? Who is Justin Trudeau, anyway?","There's probably nothing in the Canadian political strategy textbooks about how to pivot away from blackface.  Justin Trudeau and his campaign are trying, though, as they must. He addressed the photos and video that emerged this week at length Thursday afternoon. What was supposed to be a Liberal rally on Thursday night was turned into a town hall that permitted Trudeau to talk about his failings, but also some other issues. On Friday morning, Trudeau made a new campaign commitment to implement further restrictions on firearms.  The first questions from reporters after that announcement were about guns. But eventually the queries turned back to the offending images — 11 questions in total about blackface and its ramifications.  Those questions are likely to keep popping up for a while yet. But even if reporters and voters stop asking Trudeau about blackface — a natural consequence of reporters pursuing the story of the day — this episode will never really die.  Trudeau, more than any other politician, understands the power of an image. And this week's images might persist as reason to question who Trudeau is, or to frame a narrative about what kind of leader he really is.  A lifetime of contradictions  Perhaps more than any other recent Canadian politician, Trudeau has been surrounded by questions about who he is for his entire career — a consequence of his famous last name, his public stature and his lack of a track record in some serious-seeming pursuit like business or law.  Was he a callow young man or was he an inspiring leader? Was he just a pretty face or did he possess unique gifts? Was he not ready for high office or was he just the right sort of person for the job?    There are testimonies to who he was in his teens and 20s (when he apparently still thought that blackface was okay). But those accounts include contradictions.  In Magnetic North — a short biography authored by Alan Hustak in 2017 — one person describes Trudeau the high schooler as ""a bit of an attention seeker"" who ""knew the reaction he could provoke,"" but also someone who knew himself and was ""extremely sensitive to what was going on around him."" But Trudeau has said he could be shy and he has been described as a natural introvert.  Mary Margaret Jones, who ran the sexual assault centre at McGill University where Trudeau volunteered, has described the Trudeau she knew as ""really emotionally available"" and more able to discuss difficult issues like consent and rape culture than most young men his age.    Students at West Point Grey Academy in Vancouver told Hustak that they remembered Trudeau as ""energetic,"" ""slightly nerdy,"" ""eccentric"" and ""goofy."" Hustak relays a story of Trudeau accepting a student's dare to ride a skateboard down a steep slope. The future prime minister fell hard and ended up covered in mud.  ""We were all in stitches,"" the student told Hustak. ""What kind of a teacher would do that kind of thing?""  Perhaps the same kind of teacher who would show up to sell raffle tickets at a charity gala dressed as Aladdin with his face and arms and hands painted brown.    Justin Trudeau was ""emotionally available"" — and goofy. Pierre Trudeau was a showman and so was his son.  As a backbench MP and Liberal leader, Justin Trudeau was a mix of high-mindedness and stumbles. He swore at the environment minister. He made a silly comment about China. He made a very unfortunate joke about hockey and Vladimir Putin.  Principles and pratfalls  He also talked about changing the way politics is done and embracing diversity and tackling income inequality and combating climate change and pursuing reconciliation.  Either way, almost nothing that Trudeau does is done quietly.  His time in government has been a similar mix of ideals and pratfalls. Because of his office, the falls have landed harder.  His trip to the Aga Khan's island was used to undercut his stated commitment to the middle class. His trip to India revived the charge that he was insufficiently serious. The SNC-Lavalin affair undermined the claim that he was going to do things differently.  Those ideals, meanwhile, proved hard to live up to. Compared to the track Canada was on in 2015, emissions are now projected to decline by 200 megatonnes, pending further policies. But Trudeau also bought a pipeline (even if he was clear from the outset that he supported building a pipeline). Whatever the government has done to improve its relationship with Indigenous peoples, it also has surely disappointed them.  Trudeau has spoken of few issues with more passion than diversity and tolerance — perhaps overly so in some estimations. His government has enacted policies in line with that rhetoric (though one can debate whether it has moved fast enough or far enough). He has condemned white supremacy and directly challenged those who try to stoke fears about immigration — even confronting a heckler at an event in Quebec. Trudeau is likely the first prime minister to ever talk about privilege or intersectionality or unconscious bias.    ""It's time we recognize that anti-black racism and unconscious bias does exist,"" Trudeau said at a reception for Black History Month in 2018. ""It's time we hear — and believe — the stories of men and women who have been judged by the colour of their skin.""  That might've been a good moment to confess his own failings. Almost any moment would've been better for him than the current one.  Human beings are complicated and flawed. But political leaders have trouble claiming such allowances.    Having invoked a high standard, Trudeau is now charged with being a hypocrite. If you found Trudeau to be arrogant or haughty before now, you are no doubt appalled by the contradiction. Having been built up as the internet's ""boyfriend"" and an international darling, he is being taken down a peg (and because he is such a global figure, the story is getting wide notice).  He has walked himself out on a very long pier while forgetting to ensure that the planks behind him are sound.  Do those photos invalidate what he has stood for and said over the last four years? Do those images mean he shouldn't have been so strident? Or do they mean he just should have been upfront about his own failures, and sooner?  Will he be forgiven?  Trudeau will be pressed to explain how he became who he was in 2001, how he got from 2001 to 2019, and whether he ever thought about what he'd done. There are, as many have noted this week, broader issues to address coming out of this scandal. And Trudeau could put himself into that story.  Beyond the takes of columnists and pundits (the press pack has been known to misjudge the severity of controversies from time to time), voters will weigh and judge. Trudeau might be forgiven. What those images show is already turning out to be a matter of personal perspective. But the narrative will be up for debate.    Greg Lyle, an experienced pollster, wrote this week that much will depend on whether voters view the photos as an ""episodic"" failure or a ""thematic"" one — whether the photos are interpreted as a one-off lapse or part of a larger trend that speaks to who Trudeau is and how he has governed.    Even if dismissed now as lapses from Trudeau's past, the images will linger into the future as nagging memories, either to be brought up again at inconvenient moments or to be reinforced by future missteps or other excavated sins.  Trudeau can say that who he was in 2001 is not who he is now. But who he is was already a matter of debate — poked at by Conservatives who say he's ""not as advertised"" and an NDP leader who says Trudeau is more ""pretty words"" than real change.  Trudeau didn't win the last election on his own; his party's policy promises played a role as well. Those promises can now be measured against what the Liberal government has done. And the Liberals are putting forward new proposals now.  But the idea of Trudeau is more complicated now. As might've been clear before 2015, he has shown himself to be an imperfect carrier of heavy banners. But this week has directly challenged him to account for who he was supposed to be.  Trudeau was a public figure before he was a politician and he has always been a matter of some conjecture.  ""One of the first things I said when I won my nomination [in 2008] is, look, there's people out there who have incredibly high expectations, there are people out there who have incredibly low expectations,"" Trudeau told me in an interview earlier this year. ""I'm fairly certain I'm going to disappoint everybody by being somewhere in the middle between the stratosphere and the depths.""  By that measure, at least, he has lived up to expectations.",politics
105,"Hidden asbestos: Hundreds of homes in Peterborough, Ont., suspected of containing toxic material from GE plant","When Ernie Farris walked past his childhood home in Peterborough, Ont., this summer for the first time in years, he had an alarming thought.  In the late 1940s, as a young teen, he had helped his father unload a truck full of fluffy, white scrap asbestos from the local General Electric factory, spreading it in the family's attic as cheap insulation.  No masks. No gloves.   The highly concentrated material known to cause cancer sat loose upstairs for decades.  ""My mom died [at age 45] with what they called asthma in 1954. I just wonder whether it was asthma, or if there was something related to the asbestos,"" said Farris. ""We took the bags up there … spread it around. Never knew any different about any hazards.""  A CBC Newsu002FToronto Star investigation has found that from the 1940s until the mid-1970s, General Electric sold off leftover asbestos scrap from its Peterborough factory for pennies a pound, delivering it by truck to potentially hundreds of workers' homes.    Over the years, thousands of the city's homes have changed hands. Many current owners are likely unaware of the history of General Electric asbestos being used as insulation — and the company hasn't stepped in to tell them.  GE doesn't acknowledge it ever sold what is now widely known to be cancer-causing material. But in recent years, the company has paid to clean up two dozen houses in Peterborough.  And neither the company nor local health officials have alerted the community that GE has a program that pays to remove the toxic waste hidden in walls and attics across the city.  GE denied sale of asbestos  In its heyday in the '60s and '70s, General Electric employed some 6,000 workers at its Peterborough factory. But after more than a century of building large machine engines at the site, the plant was shut down in late 2018.  It leaves behind a toxic legacy: PCBs buried on the 21-acre property are leaching into the soil and groundwater and hundreds of workers have won compensation for illnesses stemming from chemical exposures at the plant.   Now the company is grappling with highly concentrated asbestos — used as a fire retardant on metal wires and cables — that wound up in untold numbers of nearby homes.    ""Some employees in Peterborough may have taken home surplus asbestos,"" GE spokesperson Karissa Boley confirmed this spring. ""However GE has since abated much of that material and continues to work with the community when additional asbestos is found.""   The company has paid to clean up two dozen houses, she said.  Keith Riel, a Peterborough city councillor who used to lead the GE workers' union, believes the company is grossly underestimating the problem.  ""Hundreds of homes in Peterborough are insulated, up in their attics, with this loose asbestos,"" said Riel. ""If they've only done a couple of dozen, then that's just not even the tip of the iceberg.""  The contractor hired by GE to do the asbestos remediation said it believes the number of contaminated homes could be in the hundreds.  But in 2004, when the issue first surfaced publicly through a series of community meetings, GE flatly denied it ever sold off the waste.  ""We are unaware of any GE Canada practice allowing or condoning sales or allowing employees to take materials home,"" a company spokesperson told the Peterborough Examiner when the issue first surfaced.    GE's denials infuriated some workers, especially those whose job it was to bag the asbestos with their bare hands and load it onto delivery trucks.  ""I was so mad I was almost shaking,"" said Jim Dufresne, who spent 42 years with GE and was tasked with recycling the asbestos in the '60s and '70s.  ""Four or five of us would go up on the roof, open up the bin, and load it into garbage bags or refrigerator boxes and put it in the truck. You didn't have any protective equipment at all,"" he recalled.  ""They told us it was just 'plucking the goose' … because it's all white and it's like feathers.""  John Lewington also recalls the dozens of times he bagged up the scrap asbestos for resale through GE's salvage yard, where he says the company kept sales records.  ""If you bought salvage or asbestos — you bought any scrap — there was a record of it, whether it be steel, whether it was wood, whether it was asbestos,"" Lewington said. ""If it was delivered, if it was picked up at the gate, there's still a receipt.""    Dufresne has suffered two bouts of cancer that he suspects were work-related. He previously received workers' compensation for chronic lung problems as a result of asbestos exposure at the factory.   Back then, he says, no one he knew understood the risks.  But when GE publicly denied ever selling the hazardous material, Dufresne and some of his colleagues began looking for concrete proof. They scoured the local archives and found a 1956 advertisement in GE's own newspaper that appears to confirm workers had been using GE asbestos in their own homes ""for years.""  ""You can insulate for 3 cents a pound,"" the ad declares. ""Installed between the ceiling joists in uninsulated homes, asbestos fluff helps to hold heat in and cold out.""    ""They lied about it,"" said Dufresne. ""It's a carcinogen if it gets loose. They should be responsible for fixing everybody's house that they sold it to.""  While asbestos in homes is not hazardous if left undisturbed, residents could be at risk of exposure if they start renovations that break apart the fibrous material behind the walls or in the attic.   The federal government implemented a near-total ban of asbestos in Canada at the end of 2018.  'Secret' clean-up program  For the past 15 years, GE has hired environmental health specialists Pinchin Ltd. to oversee abatement of the toxic material, CBC and the Star have further learned.  The company says it has remediated 24 homes in all, three in the past year alone.  But at no point did local health officials or General Electric issue a public advisory to warn other residents of potential contamination from the asbestos. Nor did they advertise that GE has a program to remove the toxic material.  Rather it's been carried out quietly, the program's existence spreading by word of mouth.  ""[It's] like a best-kept secret,"" said Dr. Rosana Salvaterra, who has served as Peterborough's medical officer of health since 2008.  ""If the program still exists — and this was not something that I was aware of — it's definitely something we need to make people aware of.""    Back in 2004, her predecessor received calls from some concerned residents, which were passed on to GE. But Salvaterra said she had no clue about the company's ongoing clean-up effort, nor was she aware that hundreds of homes could remain contaminated  ""This is new information for me,"" Salvaterra said, when CBC and the Star presented her with evidence of decades' worth of GE asbestos sales.  ""It does beg the question, you know, how many homes are out there and where is the asbestos? Is it still there? And is it well-contained? Or is it actually putting people at risk?""  GE offers 1-800 line  In a statement, GE confirmed its clean-up program continues and that the company is willing to ""work with the community and homeowners if additional material is found.""    And for the first time, GE is publicly providing a 1-800 phone number for Peterborough residents who might ""believe their homes may have insulation with asbestos-containing material"" from the now-shuttered factory.     GE Canada Environmental Programs Information Line: 1-877-399-9599.    General Electric did not answer questions about what efforts have been made to track down employees who may have taken asbestos home. GE spokesperson Jeff Cay also declined to answer why the company has not used local media or done more community outreach to promote its clean-up efforts.     Read General Electric's full statement here.    ""They should be advertising it — not this secret kind of thing,"" said Riel.  The councillor also said he plans to formally ask health authorities to track down all of the city's contaminated homes.  ""We know that if one minute amount of [asbestos] gets into somebody's lungs it can cause asbestosis. So it's the right thing to do,"" he said. ""It's a health issue. If they have a program out there, then it should be known.""  High concentration of asbestos  Historically, asbestos was widely used in household building materials, until public awareness of its health hazards saw it slowly phased out.  The material from GE's Peterborough factory is unique for both its appearance and its high concentration of asbestos; it is made up of 70 per cent chrysotile asbestos — far higher than other commercial insulations that had only three to six per cent asbestos content.  A simple laboratory test can identify GE's product.    The cost of asbestos removal can be steep, ranging from $15,000 for a small attic cleanup to more than $250,000 for a major renovation.  According to Pinchin, specially trained crews must seal off houses, remove barriers, vacuum out the toxic material and then reinsulate and rebuild — all while monitoring air quality.  GE has paid to temporarily relocate affected homeowners in Peterborough, covering all meals and hotels.  Health worries remain  When the issue of GE asbestos first surfaced back in 2004, Ernie Farris was interviewed by the Peterborough Examiner and recounted how he and his father had spread the material in their house at 558 Douglas Ave.   Months later, the company knocked on the door of that house and surprised then-owner Larry Keeley by offering to clean it up.  ""I kinda had a good feeling about the company wanting to do that,"" Keeley recalled. ""GE's willing to pay for it, so I thought, easy for me to just pack a bag and go down to the Holiday Inn for a three-week vacation; all meals paid and a swimming pool and the whole works.""    Over a period of three weeks, GE sealed off the house and removed all traces of asbestos from the attic and walls.    Keeley then received a detailed report from GE's vice-president of environment, health and safety that stated: ""By completing this work, GE is not making any admissions of any kind.""    When told that Farris's mother died of asthma-like symptoms in the 1950s while living in the same house, Keeley revealed he himself had developed asthma while living there.  ""I'm wondering to what extent there might be a connection between the asbestos in the house and the fact that I developed asthma. I'm left with a question — hadn't even thought about it until now,"" he said.    General Electric operated dozens of factories across Canada and the United States over the years, though many having shut down or relocated in recent years. GE declined to answer whether it offers similar asbestos clean-up programs in other communities.   As a result of the CBCu002FStar investigation, Peterborough's medical officer of health says she plans this fall to investigate the matter further and advise citizens about GE's clean-up program.  ""We'll use our different communication channels to get that information out,"" said Salvaterra. ""If there are homes out there where there is asbestos that needs to be remediated, those homeowners will get the assistance they need to do that.""

106,'This is a massive deal for me:' Taika Waititi's Jojo Rabbit wins TIFF's People's Choice Award,"Jojo Rabbit, Taika Waititi's Nazi Germany-set ""anti-hate satire,"" has captured the Toronto International Film Festival's coveted People's Choice Award.  The film centres on a young German boy (Roman Griffin Davis) who dreams of being a good Nazi, aided by his imaginary friend Adolf Hitler (portrayed by New Zealand filmmaker Waititi).  His world is turned upside down when he discovers a teenaged Jewish girl (Thomasin McKenzie) being hidden in his home by his mother (Scarlett Johansson). The movie is loosely based on the novel Caging Skies by Christine Leunens.  ""It's a huge honour and this is a massive deal for me,"" Waititi said in a video posted by TIFF organizers Sunday.   ""The outpouring of love and emotion and support for the film from the audiences was just the first time I'd experienced that and it's going to stay with me forever. And now this award, it's incredible.""     During the festival, Waititi defended his film against those critical of its whimsical feel and irreverent take on the waning days of the Nazi regime.   ""I think, more than ever, it's vital that we [remind] people of what happened [during the Second World War],"" he told CBC News.     ""If that involves having to bring in fantasy characters and using magic realism and using different techniques and sometimes comedy, so be it. We have to keep telling these stories.""    The People's Choice Prize is the second honour Indigenous writer-director and performer Waititi received at the festival this year.  Known for his superhero blockbuster Thor: Ragnarok, cult vampire comedy What We Do in the Shadows, as well as acclaimed New Zealand films Boy and Hunt for the Wilderpeople, he was also the recipient of the TIFF Ebert Director Award at the festival's inaugural TIFF Tribute Awards fundraising gala.    Runners-up for the top TIFF prize included Marriage Story, Noah Baumbach's modern portrait of a disintegrating relationship, and Parasite, Bong Joon-ho's upstairs-downstairs thriller that captured the Palme d'Or in Cannes.    TIFF is widely considered the unofficial start to the movie awards season, with films that win the festival's main People's Choice Award often going on to receive further kudos and acclaim. Past TIFF winners have included movies such as Green Room, La La Land, Room, 12 Years a Slave, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri and Slumdog Millionaire, all of which subsequently went on to major recognition at the Oscars.   Other winners announced Sunday include:      People's Choice Documentary Award: The Cave, a portrait of a doctor operating a subterranean Syrian hospital, directed by Feras Fayyad.   People's Choice Midnight Madness Award: dystopian prison horror film The Platform, directed by Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia.   Best Canadian First Feature Film ($15,000): The Twentieth Century, a surreal re-imagining of William Lyon Mackenzie King's formative years, directed by Matthew Rankin.   Best Canadian Feature Film ($30,000): modern-day adaptation Antigone directed by Sophie Deraspe.   Short Cuts Award for Best Canadian Short Film ($10,000): Delphine, centred on a Lebanese-Canadian teen girl, directed by Chloé Robichaud.    Short Cuts Award for Best Short Film ($10,000): tender feline tale All Cats Are Grey in the Dark, directed by Lasse Linder.   NETPAC Award: Lebanon-set school drama 1982, directed by Oualid Mouaness.     This year, TIFF's leadership chose to change the way it presents its final awards and dispensed with its traditional final-day gathering to unveil prize-winners.  Instead, organizers split up the various honours (the first batch emerged on Thursday) and revealed the recipients via press release and social media, including posting video reactions from most of the winning filmmakers on Sunday.  Previously announced winners include:     Toronto Platform Prize ($20,000): Martin Eden, directed by Pietro Marcello.   International Critics' Prize (FIPRESCI), Discovery Program: Murmur, directed by Heather Young.   International Critics' Prize (FIPRESCI), Special Presentations Program: How to Build a Girl, directed by Coky Giedroyc.    TIFF has scheduled free screenings of some of this year's winning films — including the recipients of the People's Choice Award, the People's Choice Documentary Award, the People's Choice Midnight Madness Award and the Toronto Platform Prize — at TIFF Bell Lightbox in downtown Toronto on Sunday afternoon.  Organizers also announced that the 45th edition of the Toronto International Film Festival will be held Sept.10-20, 2020.",entertainment
107,"Best Buy, Staples accused of 'urging' customers to pirate TV shows with devices sold in stores","Premium TV network Super Channel has filed a lawsuit against four Canadian retailers for allegedly selling ""pirate devices"" and educating customers how to use them to watch TV without paying for it.   In a court document filed in Federal Court this week, Super Channel accuses Best Buy, Staples, Canada Computers and London Drugs of copyright infringement, claiming their employees are ""urging"" customers to pirate online content using streaming devices that are sold in store.   The four retailers ""are advertently contributing to the creation of a culture of widespread infringement and theft,"" Super Channel alleges in the document. ""Their actions are high-handed and unfair to their customers and causing damage to the plaintiff.""  Also listed as defendants in the lawsuit are customers who bought the ""pirate devices"" and received accompanying advice in store. They're currently listed as ""John Doe customers"" because Super Channel doesn't have their names, although it plans to pursue this information.   The network wouldn't name each of the ""pirate devices"" involved, but said that the case includes Android boxes, which have become the scourge of the cable industry. When special software is added and the boxes are connected to TVs, they can be used to stream unauthorized content — including movies and TV shows that Super Channel owns the rights to in Canada.  Customers only pay a one-time fee for the box, usually around $60 to $200.  Caught on camera  As part of its case, Super Channel claims to have more than 100 hours of undercover video gathered by private investigators who visited multiple Best Buy, Staples, Canada Computers and London Drugs locations, posing as customers curious about pirating content.   Super Channel provided CBC News with a segment of the video. It includes audio allegedly from employees from each of the four retailers, who offer advice about in-store devices that can be set up to stream shows without paying for them.   ""This gets you free content, like free TV and movies,"" someone said in one audio clip from the video.  ""You don't have to pay for anything else when you pay for this,"" said another.    Super Channel CEO Don McDonald said he was ""shocked"" when he viewed the footage. The video captures more than 150 incidents supporting Super Channel's case, he said, and that the employees involved in promoting these devices range from floor staff to higher-ups.   ""Managers that are not kids — they're in their 30s and 40s, telling people how to do it,"" McDonald said. ""It is rampant.""  Why would store staff assist customers? In the court document, Super Channel alleges the motive is ""to encourage and increase the sales of the pirate devices.""    Best Buy, Staples, Canada Computers and London Drugs — which each received copies of the lawsuit this week — told CBC News that they deny the allegations and follow Canadian copyright laws.   ""[We] believe that the claims are entirely without merit,"" a Best Buy spokesperson said in an email. ""We respect and value intellectual property, and believe content providers and artists should be fairly compensated for their work.""  McDonald said that Super Channel showed the video to the four retailers in the spring, but that failed to put a stop to the problem. ""I wanted them to be step up and be a champion in changing the culture,"" he said. ""They didn't see the light.""    CBC News asked each retailer about their meeting with Super Channel. Only London Drugs responded, stating that the network refused to disclose which products it took issue with.  ""Nevertheless, we took the opportunity to remind our employees of the importance of Canadian copyright compliance and adherence to our code of conduct,"" London Drugs spokesperson Wendy Hartley said in an email.   War on piracy  Super Channel is seeking damages for loss of business due to the retailers' customers pirating its content. It also wants a permanent injunction to prevent Best Buy, Staples, Canada Computers and London Drugs from selling and promoting ""pirate devices.""  ""We want the stores to stop. We want the stores to say, 'Hey this is wrong,'"" said McDonald.     The lawsuit is just the latest attempt to curb piracy in Canada. In 2016, Bell, Rogers and Videotron launched a legal battle in Federal Court, targeting smaller dealers who sell Android boxes pre-loaded with software used to pirate content.   The case is ongoing and the list of defendants has ballooned from five in 2016 to more than 130 today.  Last year, Bell and Rogers also joined a coalition of more than 30 members, including CBC and Super Channel, which proposed blocking Canadians from websites offering pirated content. However, the plan was rejected by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, which said it didn't have jurisdiction to enforce it.    Critics have argued it's impossible to stamp out technology that enables piracy, so the best solution is to offer affordable and easily accessible programming.  McDonald estimates Super Channel loses about $12 million a year from subscribers who turn to piracy. He said he hopes the lawsuit will help change the culture of piracy by sending a message that it's not acceptable   ""This affects our business and it's the wrong thing to do,"" he said. ""If we can even start to make a dent in this from an awareness point of view, then we are on the right track.""",technology

109,WHO says Tanzania not sharing details on Ebola-like cases,"The World Health Organization has issued an unusual statement raising questions about whether Tanzania is covering up possible cases of the deadly Ebola virus, a significant cause for concern during a regional outbreak that has been declared a rare global health emergency.  The statement on Saturday said Tanzania's government ""despite several requests"" is refusing to share the results of its investigations into a number of patients with Ebola-like symptoms and is refusing to ship patient samples to an outside WHO partner lab.  Tanzania's government, which has said it has no Ebola cases, could not immediately be reached for comment Sunday. The cases would be the first-ever Ebola infections confirmed in the East African country.  The United Nations health agency says it was made aware on Sept. 10 of the death in Tanzania's commercial capital, Dar es Salaam, of a 27-year-old patient suspected to have Ebola. A day later, it received unofficial reports that an Ebola test had come back positive. On Thursday, it received unofficial reports that a contact of the patient, who had travelled widely in the country, was sick and hospitalized.  A rapid response is crucial in containing Ebola, which can be fatal in up to 90 per cent of cases and is most often spread by close contact with bodily fluids of people exhibiting symptoms or with contaminated objects.  Assessing risk difficult  The WHO statement said the lack of information from Tanzania made it difficult to assess potential risks.  The Ebola outbreak based in neighbouring Congo has infected over 3,000 people and killed nearly 2,000 of them. A few cases have been confirmed in neighbouring Uganda as well, and other neighbouring countries have been preparing for the outbreak's possible spread.    This is not the first time health officials have raised serious questions about the suspected Tanzania cases. On Monday, the U.S. health and human services secretary, Alex Azar, told reporters in Uganda that he and others were ""very concerned about the lack of transparency"" in Tanzania.  Critics have shown increasing alarm as Tanzanian President John Magufuli's government has restricted access to key information and cracked down on perceived dissent. Lawmakers recently approved an amendment to a statistics law to make it a crime to distribute information not sanctioned by the government or which contradicts the government.  The World Bank was among those expressing concern at that amendment.",health
110,Advocates hope Queer Eye star's HIV-positive disclosure helps break stigma,"Advocates at a Winnipeg fundraiser in support of HIV awareness and funding are hoping the recent revelation made by Queer Eye star Jonathan Van Ness about being HIV-positive will help break the stigma around and educate people about those living with the diagnosis.  Van Ness told The New York Times in an article published Saturday that, when he was 25, he fainted while working at a salon and went to Planned Parenthood to diagnosis his flu-like symptoms. There, he tested positive for HIV.   ""That day was just as devastating as you would think it would be,"" Van Ness, the grooming expert on the Netflix makeover show, wrote in his memoir Over the Top, which is set to be released on Tuesday and was quoted by the Times.  The now 32-year-old says he hopes his disclosure will help break the stigma around HIV, and that others will come out and join him as a ""member of the beautiful HIV-positive community.""  Barb Burkowski, an organizer of Sunday's Red Ribbon Walk &amp; Run in Winnipeg, an event that aims to fight against HIV stigma and to raise money for programs and services for those living with HIV, says Van Ness coming out as HIV-positive can help those who aren't out.   ""We have people who have HIV and have a self-stigma where they don't want to come out,"" Burkowski told CBC News.    ""If we have people that come out on a bigger level, it's more likely that people will feel a little bit better.""  Christine Bibeau, who has been living with HIV for 10 years, was a participant at Sunday's event.  ""For a long time, I was a closet HIV-positive person,"" she told CBC News.  ""One of the things I really remember was somebody close in my family, when I first had told them I was HIV-positive, right away phoned up somebody else because I had been at their baby shower and I held their baby. That kind of still sticks with me, 10 years later.""    Bibeau hopes to combat disinformation about HIV — Public Health Agency of Canada says HIV can't be spread by ""casual contact"" — noting she now has three children, all born after learning she was positive and all of whom are HIV-negative. She also said revelations like those made by Van Ness go a long way to helping.  ""I would like to see more people being OK about being open about [being HIV-positive], because I think that comes into education,"" she said.  Kyle Voth, who also participated in the event to support the cause, agrees.  ""I think it's a really brave thing to do,"" he told CBC News.    ""It's giving young people and both queer and straight people a really positive voice in [the HIV-positive] community about it. It's really great.""  Brent Young, who participated in Sunday's event in drag, said he was diagnosed and came out as positive during the AIDS era. He notes being positive is no longer the death sentence it once was and also applauds Van Ness for coming out.  ""He has the platform where he can actively crusade,"" he said.    ""It's also positive that other people can see this in the rest of the world, and say, 'Hey, somebody else has this too. I don't have to be alone any more.""  As of 2016, there were more than 63,000 Canadians living with HIV, according to estimates released by the Public Health Agency of Canada last year.  Of those, an estimated 14 per cent were unaware or undiagnosed.   It also says people taking appropriate amounts of antiretroviral treatment ""pose effectively no risk of transmitting HIV infection to their sexual partner.""",entertainment

The 89-year-old Detroit native built Motown Records into a hit-making music, film and television empire that shattered racial barriers and introduced the world at large to the sounds of R&amp;B, soul and funk. Gordy sold the record label in 1988, but remained active, developing a musical and staying involved with the Motown Museum's $50 million expansion campaign.  Speaking about retirement, Gordy said he has ""dreamed about it, talked about it, threatened it"" for years.  Director Lee Daniels also presented Gordy with the Motown Legacy honour.",entertainment
112,Scheer promises to clear veterans benefits backlog if elected,"Andrew Scheer made a slew of promises to veterans on Sunday morning, including pledging that a Conservative government would deal with the backlog of veterans benefits applications within two years.   The Conservatives are proposing to create a military covenant between the federal government and all veterans — a legislative pledge to ensure veterans are respected and provided with services in a timely manner.   ""Our military heroes are deserving. Our military heroes are worth it,"" he said, addressing a crowd of veterans sitting on a cliff above the ocean in Canoe Cove, P.E.I.  Scheer didn't say what that would mean in practical terms, but said it's about changing the ""culture"" around veterans.    The Parliamentary Budget Office estimates the promise to clear the application backlog would cost $51 million over two years.   That backlog has been a problem for the federal government for years.  Most waiting 4 months or more  The Liberals have been struggling to work through the stack of benefits applications. As of last December, Veterans Affairs had 27,107 disability claims registered in the system. Of those, 15,421 — 57 per cent of the total — had been waiting in the queue for more than four months.  Trudeau's government hired more frontline staff and committed $42 million over two years to clear up the backlog. But the system has been plagued with issues, including an accounting error that short-changed 270,000 ex-soldiers on their benefits.  ""Talk is cheap,"" Scheer said of his opponent. ""You have been betrayed. You deserve better.""     On top of dealing with the backlog, the Conservatives say they will create a pension system that is more fair to disabled former military members.   The Parliamentary Budget Office released its analysis of the Conservatives' proposal to increase pension payments, estimating the cost in the 2020-2021 fiscal year (the first year it's in place) at $103 million. It would drop in half to $51 million the following year and flatline around that mark up to 2029.  During the 2015 election campaign, the Liberals promised to give injured military members the option of receiving either a lifetime pension or a lump sum disability award.  Liberal reworking of pensions poorly received  The previous pension system was proposed by the Martin Liberals in 2005 and enacted by the Harper government in 2006, with injured veterans offered a lump sum payment most considered inadequate.  The new Liberal plan, which involved a complex redrawing of the benefits system, was unveiled in December 2017 and implemented this year.    A PBO report from earlier this year found that new system of benefits for injured veterans is slightly more generous than the one it replaces, but leaves the most severely disabled in worse financial shape.  The dearth of services for veterans dates back to the Harper years with the shutting of eight Veterans Affairs offices.   ""We have a new opportunity,"" Scheer said of the Harper cuts, reaffirming he has a ""personal interest in ensuring that the commitments we've made today are followed through on.""   Commemorations, service dogs, mefloquine inquiry  The Conservatives would also beef up transition services for discharged and retiring Forces members, provide more service dogs, kick-start more commemoration projects and launch an independent inquiry to investigate the cases of members who were given mefloquine.   Several Forces members have launched a lawsuit against the government because of traumatic side effects from the anti-malaria drug.  They allege they are still suffering from psychosis, paranoia and insomnia.  That investigation would cost $20 million over two years, according to the PBO. Service dog costs are pegged at $4.5 million over three years.",politics
113,"Many women say 1st sexual experience was forced in teens, U.S. study says","The first sexual experience for 1 in 16 U.S. women was forced or coerced intercourse in their early teens, encounters that for some may have had lasting health repercussions, a study suggests.  The experiences amount to rape, the authors say, although they relied on a national survey that didn't use the word in asking women about forced sex.  Almost 7 per cent of women surveyed said their first sexual intercourse experience was involuntary; it happened at age 15 on average and the man was often several years older.  Almost half of those women who said intercourse was involuntary said they were held down and slightly more than half of them said they were verbally pressured to have sex against their will.    ""Any sexual encounter [with penetration] that occurs against somebody's will is rape. If somebody is verbally pressured into having sex, it's just as much rape,"" said lead author Dr. Laura Hawks, an internist and Harvard Medical School researcher.  In the years after coerced or forced sex, affected women had more sex partners, unwanted pregnancies and abortions, and more reproductive health problems including pelvic pain and menstrual irregularities than women whose first sexual experience wasn't forced. Almost 16 per cent reported fair or poor health, double the rate of other women. The study couldn't establish whether forced sex caused or contributed to any of the health or other problems.  ""Experiencing rape at first sexual encounter is an extreme loss of autonomy over one's sexuality,"" Hawks said. She said it's not surprising that it might lead to later mental and physical health problems, given other studies on lasting effects of trauma.  The results were published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine.  Poorer psychological well-being  Other studies have found that long-term effects of sexual assault may include social isolation, feelings of powerlessness, stigmatization, poor self-image and risky behaviour, which all may increase risks for depression and other mental health problems, a journal editorial said.  Research published last year also found worse psychological well-being and physical health among women whose first intercourse was forced or coerced.  The new study is an analysis of responses from 13,310 adult women who participated in nationally representative U.S. government health surveys from 2011-2017, before the emergence of the ""Me, Too"" movement.  The researchers focused on a survey question that asked during in-person interviews if women's first vaginal intercourse experience with a man ""was voluntary or not voluntary, that is, did you did you choose to have sex of your own free will or not?""    The results suggest that for 1 in 16 American women — or 3 million — the first sexual encounter was not voluntary.  According to the federal U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 1 in 5 women have been raped in their lifetimes. For almost half of those women, it happened when they were younger than 18.  The study, which asked women from ages 18-44 to recall their first sexual experience, has no information on women's relationship with the men, who could have been boyfriends, relatives or strangers. Men were not included in the study.  Inadequate sex education  Hawks said boys need to be taught communication skills to prevent them from pursuing sex ""with someone who is an unwilling participant."" The onus should not be on the victims, she said.  ""The 'Me, Too' movement is a promising sign that we're more willing as a society"" to address sexual violence she said.  The journal editorial notes that the study lacks information on women's health and any abuse before their first sexual encounter. There also is no data on any later sexual violence — which all might contribute to health problems, the editorial said.  ""Such research is needed to understand and address the full range and consequences of these experiences,"" the editorial said.  Sex education specialist Dan Rice said inadequate sex education in U.S. schools contributes to the problem.  ""Our culture teaches people not to be raped instead of teaching people not to rape,"" he said.  Close calls  Consent isn't always on the agenda and boys often aren't taught how to express their emotions in healthy ways, said Rice, interim executive director at Answer, a Rutgers University group that provides sex education training for teachers and oversees Sex, Etc., a teen-run sex education magazine and website.  Sarah Emily Baum, 19, a staff writer for Sex, Etc., said the study results ring true.  ""Almost everyone has a story or a close call like this one or knows someone with a story or close call,"" said Baum, a sophomore at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York.  Baum recalls that a police officer invited to discuss sexual consent and assault at her high school focused only on girls, telling them, ""'You've got to make sure you say no and say it loud enough for people to hear.""' There was little mention of boys' responsibility, and no discussion of same-sex assaults or even girls being the aggressors, said Baum, who is gay.  ""If I go on a date with another girl, I also have to make sure there is clear consent and clear boundaries,"" she said. ""It goes both ways.""",health
114,New Leonard Cohen album of previously unreleased songs coming November,"A new posthumous album of previously unreleased Leonard Cohen music was announced by Sony Music on Friday.  Entitled Thanks for the Dance, the album will be released on Nov. 22.  The iconic Canadian singer, songwriter and poet from Montreal died in Los Angeles on Nov. 7, 2016, at age 82.  Sony Music said in a written statement the album is a collection of never-heard-before music sketched out while Cohen and his son, Adam Cohen, were working on their collaboration You Want it Darker. The elder artist had asked his son to bring these works to completion.  The album was made in several locations with contributions from numerous other artists, many of them former Cohen collaborators.  Javier Mas, acclaimed player of the Spanish laúd, a stringed instrument, who accompanied Cohen on stage for his last eight years of touring, flew to Los Angeles from Barcelona to capture the late artist's spirit using Cohen's own guitar.  At a music festival in Berlin, Adam Cohen invited friends to lend their talents. Damien Rice and Leslie Feist contributed vocal tracks, while Richard Reed Parry of Arcade Fire played bass.  In Los Angeles, Jennifer Warnes, a close friend and collaborator of Cohen's known in part for her own soulful interpretations of some of his songs, sang background vocals.  ""In composing and arranging the music for his words, we chose his most characteristic musical signatures, in this way keeping him with us,"" Adam Cohen said in the Sony statement. ""What moves me most about the album is the startled response of those who have heard it. 'Leonard lives!' they say, one after the other.""  The first song from the album premiered on CBC Radio's q with Tom Power on Friday.    The announcement comes on the same day Canada Post is set to honour Cohen with a new set of stamps.   The three-stamp set will be unveiled at an event at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts this afternoon.  Canada Post says it will produce four million stamps, a number it believes will be sufficient for fans and collectors worldwide.    The stamps will be available to the public as of Saturday — which would have been Cohen's 85th birthday — with Canada Post hosting a special event at a downtown Montreal post office.  The design of the stamps has been a closely-guarded secret ahead of Friday's event, which will take place in the shadow a massive Cohen mural on Crescent Street that has become a mainstay of the Montreal landscape.",entertainment
115,The science behind why vaping is becoming so popular in Canada,"Vaping is quickly becoming a lot more popular with Canadians, despite what little is known of its long-term health effects.  Experts say part of the reason for the surge in use in such a short time is the evolution of the devices themselves.  ""We used to say that cigarettes are the most effective way of consuming nicotine, but e-cigarettes have replaced them,"" said Dr. Robert Schwartz, a senior scientist at Toronto's Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH).  ""They're so small and discreet and these new devices don't create the huge clouds that the previous devices did — people can use them anywhere, all the time.""  Newer devices such as Juul or Vype, which came to the Canadian market last fall, mimic the physical feeling of a cigarette on the throat and use what are known as ""nicotine salts"" to deliver higher concentrations of the drug to the brain — much in the same way that cigarettes do.   ""It used to be that if the nicotine concentration was too high, it would give you a harsh or aversive feeling on your throat,"" says David Hammond, a public health professor at the University of Waterloo who researches vaping in youth.   ""Juul solved that. That's why Juul is somewhere around half the market. That's why most of the other major brands in Canada, including Vype and the smaller ones, have switched to nicotine salts.""    E-cigarettes themselves aren't new, having been first introduced in Canada in 2004, according to the Heart and Stroke Foundation, but the chemistry behind the devices has changed dramatically in the past two years with new players on the market.   Schwartz says before the use of nicotine salts in products like Juul, the highest nicotine concentrations commercially sold in Canada were typically upward of 20 milligrams per millilitre, which is the regulated limit in the European Union.   The maximum amount of nicotine content allowed in e-cigarettes in Canada is currently 66 milligrams per millilitre, according to Health Canada. The Canadian Cancer Society says the highest amount used in Juul products is 59, and 57 in Vype.  Juul says one of its cartridges, or pods, has roughly the same amount of nicotine as a pack of 20 cigarettes.    ""Once they solved the chemistry of palatable nicotine delivery, then all those others factors that were responsible for vaping becoming popular,"" Hammond says.   ""You throw in tasty flavours and boom you have a wonderful little drug delivery device that sits in your pocket.""   Smoking alternative  Eva Egnatieva, 16, started using an e-cigarette two months ago and admits she doesn't know exactly why.   ""My friends, they're older than me and they're all smoking this,"" the Toronto high school student said while inhaling a Juul e-cigarette between classes.   ""I think when I'm nervous or I have some problem, I smoke it and I'm relaxed, not worried.""     Egnatieva says that while she's never smoked a cigarette, she started using an e-cigarette without nicotine at the age of 15. She says the first time she tried an e-cigarette with nicotine in it she hated it, but stuck with it.   ""I only smoke Juul,"" she says. ""I don't like to smoke cigarettes because I hate the smell of cigarettes.""   Egnatieva says she has little knowledge of the long-term health effects of using the device, but it doesn't discourage her from using it and has no plans to quit.    Leo Ting, a 38-year-old University of Toronto faculty member, says he transitioned to using an e-cigarette to quit smoking three years ago.  ""I've gotten to the point to where I touch a cigarette and I do not want to have another one,"" he says.  ""Which is not something that was the case when I was trying to cold turkey it before, so this has helped in that case.""  He says he hopes to stop vaping completely in about a year, in order to lower the chances of having a relapse, and has been gradually lowering the amount of nicotine he consumes in the device.   Surge in popularity   Hammond says the growing popularity of e-cigarettes in Canada is in part because of their use as a tool to quit smoking, but also because of their attractiveness to young people.   ""Juul has both made them more likely to help smokers quit, it's also made them more likely to bring new non-smoking youth into the market,"" he says.  ""We need to make them available to adult smokers; we still have five million Canadians that smoke, but we've done a poor job at framing these products as something you use to quit smoking, rather than something you take to a party on Friday night when you're 17.""    Hammond led a study published in the British Medical Journal last June, based on online surveys of Canadians aged 16 to 19 in 2017 and 2018, which found that the number of Canadian teens who said they had vaped in the last month had grown 74 per cent, from 8.4 per cent in 2017 to 14.6 per cent in 2018.  New data from the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse show a significant increase in teenagers in grades eight, 10 and 12 who say they have used an e-cigarette since 2018. One in 11 U.S. students in Grade 8 reported they had vaped in the past month in 2019, one in five in Grade 10 and one in four in Grade 12.    ""What we're seeing now is rapidly increasing rates of e-cigarette use in teens and young adults,"" says Dr. Nicholas Chadi, a pediatrician at CHU Sainte-Justine in Montreal and addiction medicine specialist.   ""They've been very aggressively marketed in all sorts of forms — social media and big billboard ads — to target young people, even though companies will say the contrary. The marketing strategy has worked very well.""   Health concerns   On Wednesday, health officials in London, Ont., announced what's believed to be the first case in Canada of a respiratory illness linked to vaping. The high-school-age individual used e-cigarettes daily, was initially on life-support, and is now recovering at home.   While it's not yet known what was in the cartridge, Health Canada says it's concerned by reports of severe pulmonary illness as well as the increase in vaping reported among Canadian youth and it's considering ""additional measures"" regarding the role of flavours, nicotine concentration and product design, and how all of that contributes to vaping's appeal to youth and non-smokers.    Toronto Public Health reported Thursday they had also encountered a small number of patients in recent weeks who potentially had a vaping-related illness.   The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 530 confirmed and probable cases of lung injury related to e-cigarettes as of Sept. 17, including at least seven deaths.     ""This remains a relatively new phenomenon in our country so we're still wrestling to understand the long-term health effects, but certainly the short-term are incredibly concerning,"" says Terry Dean, president and CEO of the Canadian Lung Association. ""We certainly cannot view them as harmless, because they're not.""   Dean says appropriate regulation, policy and education led to the curbing of tobacco consumption rates in Canada and he believes a similar approach should be taken as soon as possible with e-cigarettes and in particular where they're accessible for youth.   ""If you're not vaping today — don't start. Blanket statement,"" he said. ""If you are vaping to help stop smoking, your end goal should be to stop vaping.""    Chadi says there has never been such a ""rapid uptake"" in the history of recorded substance use in teens, many of whom may not know how addictive they are and how much nicotine they contain.  ""There is some research that shows for young people ages 25 and under with a brain that's still changing, these devices are not an effective smoking cessation tool because you can get very hooked up to the nicotine that comes with it,"" he says.  ""Doctors, pediatricians, but also dentists, social workers and school nurses need to ask the right questions to teens to know if they're using them, what they think about them and try to help.""",health
116,What Purdue Pharma's bankruptcy filing means for Canada,"This is an excerpt from Second Opinion, a weekly roundup of eclectic and under-the-radar health and medical science news emailed to subscribers every Saturday morning. If you haven't subscribed yet, you can do that by clicking here.    Purdue Pharma filed for bankruptcy in the U.S. this week to protect itself and its owners from more than 2,000 lawsuits over their role in the ongoing opioid crisis, but the move has put pressure on Canadian efforts to bring the company to face legal action here.  The company, which is owned by members of the Sackler family, made billions selling the prescription painkiller OxyContin that is widely seen as a catalyst to the crisis that claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. It filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy Sunday and proposed a settlement in the U.S. worth up to $12 billion US.  At the centre of the lawsuits is the allegation that the company marketed and promoted prescription opioids as less addictive than was actually known, while misleading both those prescribing the medications and the patients themselves about the risks.   Future of Canadian lawsuits  Last year, the B.C. government launched a similar class-action lawsuit against Purdue Pharma and more than 40 other companies on behalf of all provincial, territorial and federal governments over the marketing of opioids in Canada. The suit aims to recover the health care costs of the crisis.   The concern in Canada is that because of the U.S. bankruptcy filing, the assets at the centre of the lawsuit could be in jeopardy, says Matthew Herder, director of the Health Law Institute at Dalhousie University in Halifax.    ""There's a bit of a race underway to secure what wealth remains in that company because that is ultimately the source of the money that might be paid,"" he said.  ""There have been reports of the Sackler family having transferred wealth to various offshore locations, so there are growing questions around what the financial state of play is for that company and its affiliates like the Canadian ones.""   Reidar Mogerman, lead counsel for the lawsuit in B.C., says the provinces are looking for ""fair resolution"" that can address the ongoing opioid crisis.     ""The total cost, if I win my case, is bigger than Purdue can pay. They have set loose an epidemic that is larger than they can pay for,"" Mogerman said.  ""The provinces are realistic about what they will recover. They're not necessarily going to recover every dollar they've spent, but they are going to recover enough money to help fix the crisis, and they're going to recover from the people they say were responsible for the crisis.""  The bankruptcy filing also speaks to the lack of federal regulation Purdue Pharma has faced in Canada over its marketing of OxyContin, says Dr. Nav Persaud, a family doctor at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto.     ""It shows how Purdue Pharma and other opioid manufacturers have been given free rein in Canada,"" he said.   A key point of contention in the lawsuit is the claim from Purdue Pharma Canada that it is a ""separate company"" from Purdue Pharma in the U.S. and the actions taken to settle litigation there don't ""directly affect"" its business in Canada.    ""Purdue Canada is being a bit cute in saying that they are a separate entity for the purpose of the bankruptcy because they are a wholly owned asset of the bankrupt company,"" Mogerman said.   ""Eventually, that bankruptcy will swallow Purdue Canada.""   Misleading marketing allegations  The Canadian lawsuit rests on the same principles alleging misleading advertising and understating the addictive qualities of opioids, but there are differences in the legal systems that make prosecuting the companies challenging — including the speed in which the courts move.   ""It has taken them I think 20 years, but the tobacco companies in Canada are now bankrupt and facing the recovery actions brought by the provinces. It has just taken a long time to get there,"" Mogerman said.     ""Eventually, the result will be the same. If they did something bad they're going to have to pay in Canada, just like they will in the U.S.""   Purdue Pharma Canada said in a statement that it followed all of Health Canada's regulations, including those governing marketing, and it's ""deeply concerned"" about the opioid crisis in B.C. and across Canada.    But Persaud says there is ""documented evidence"" that Purdue Pharma Canada alleged in medical journals that long-acting opioids such as OxyContin had a lower abuse potential than earlier opioids.   Sacklers under fire  Ahead of the bankruptcy filing this summer, the Canadian class action also applied to add individual members of the Sackler family to the lawsuit, as well as other ""senior decision makers"" at Purdue Pharma Canada.     ""We are comfortable, based on the things that we've alleged, that those individuals are also liable for the healthcare costs that the government entities paid in relation to opioids,"" Mogerman said.   ""They're not the company but they have their own potential individual liability and they don't want to be chased to the ends of the earth for their share.""    Herder says the decision to apply to add the Sacklers to the Canadian lawsuit is the ""right move"" but doesn't necessarily mean it will be successful in establishing liability.   ""I don't think that's the end of the story as to whether the Sacklers will ever pay a dime of their own personal finances.""

117,Asteroid breakup 466 million years ago may have triggered ice age,"Roughly 466 million years ago, an asteroid broke apart almost half a billion kilometres from Earth. And according to a new study published in Science Advances on Wednesday, that event may have played a vital role in shaping life on our planet.  Using previous studies on paleoclimate (the study of ancient climate), biodiversity and existing studies on the breakup of this 150-kilometre rock in the asteroid belt, a team of scientists suggests that the Mid-Ordovician ice age was greatly affected by dust from the asteroid that made its way to Earth.  They hypothesize that over a span of two million years, dust enveloped Earth, shrouding it from sunlight, which in turn caused a cooling effect that intensified the ice age and lowered sea levels.  Not all of this was bad, however. They also theorize that it subsequently led to a burst of marine biodiversity.      Earth is constantly being bombarded by dust and meteorites — including some that are very small, called micrometeorites. It's estimated that roughly 100 tonnes of space dust falls to Earth daily, including some from this asteroid that broke-up half a billion years ago.  But while this dust goes pretty much unnoticed today, 466 million years ago, roughly 10,000 times more dust was falling on Earth.  And this, the researchers believe, was vital in reshaping Earth.  ""People always think of the global killer, but it can be the opposite,"" said Philipp Heck, co-author of the study and a curator at the Field Museum.  ""I think this study shows we have to think outside of the box, and that a catastrophic event in the solar system can have very constructive consequences on other planets, and on Earth especially.""  Accidental finding  In the 1980s, workers in a quarry in southern Sweden found meteorites contained in sedimentary rock. Birger Schmitz, lead author of this new study, trained the workers to identify further samples, and eventually more than 100 specimens were collected. Even more were found in the 1990s.  Chemical analysis of these and other, smaller meteorites yielded a surprise.  ""Oxygen has three stable forms,"" said Heck, who is also an associate professor at the University of Chicago's department of the geophysical sciences.  ""We can measure the abundance of three stable types of oxygen, and for us geochemists and cosmochemists, this is like a genetic fingerprint … and we used this to determine all of the meteorites found in the middle-Ordovician sediment, and all of the micrometeorites — including one asteroid that made a crater — they all came from one single source: the L-chondrite parent body.""  There are three types of groups of ordinary chondrites: L-chondrite (low-iron), H-chondrite (high-iron) and LL-chondrites (low-iron, low-metal). L- and H-chondrites are considered ""ordinary"" chondrites as most meteorites collected today belong to these two groups.   But, as Heck puts it, ""Before the breakup L-chondrites weren't ordinary.""    In this new study, the researchers went back to Sweden to examine dust contained in sedimentary rock. This dust would be too small to have been noticed. What they found was this, too, matched the L-chondrite parent body. And it also coincided with the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event (GOBE).   ""Everything matches and … lead us to conclude that this extraterrestrial dust likely played an important role in cooling, and that triggered biodiversification. It's not that we have absolute proof of it, but we have very good evidence that it was an important factor.""  Heck said that this new paper is merely a hypothesis about what could have contributed to the chilly period, and the subsequent rise in marine life, not that it was the only factor. But it's one with which he's fairly confident.  ""This is an important hypothesis. I think it's very plausible,"" he said. ""I think one of the things that needs to be done is to use our ground-truth data from the sediments, feed it into a paleoclimatological model and see how this plays out.""    Roger Summons, a Schlumberger professor of geobiology at MIT, agrees that more investigation needs to be done.  ""It's a very interesting paper and, from my knowledge of the authors' prior work, very solid,"" he said. ""But the geological data comes from two sections in Sweden and Russia so, I guess, the obvious question to ask next is where else could these observations be checked.""  Heck said another important part to this study is that it highlights that what happens elsewhere in the solar system could have profound effects on Earth.  ""It's important to realize that not everything is a closed system,"" Heck said. ""Extraterrestrial events can have important consequences.""",technology
118,Climate change and the personal sacrifice debate on the campaign trail,"There's a political gamble involved in climate change promises.    As the country gears up for the federal election, all the major parties are offering a vision for how they would deal with Canada's climate concerns. These plans vary in goal, process and degrees of specificity, yet on the campaign trail they all need to be sold to the public.   It could be a tough sell.   ""It's one of the important things about this election,"" said George Hoberg at the University of British Columbia's School of Public Policy and Global Affairs. He specializes in environmental and natural resource policy.  ""Canadians are confronting the stark choices about what kind of contribution they want to make to the global effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,"" Hoberg said.  The party platforms require some form of sacrifice from all of us — whether as businesses or as individuals. How much and what kind of  sacrifice is a matter of debate scientifically and politically.   ""We have seen the polarization of climate [change] occurring throughout the world,"" said Duane Bratt, a political science professor at Mount Royal University.  ""There was a time where there was a consensus on this and now it is largely split. We see it dramatically in the United States, we're seeing it in Canada as well,"" said Bratt.  The language, the rhetoric and substance of each party's climate action plan will have been cautiously nuanced and aligned to overall party values and core voters. But it also will have to take into account the public's tolerance for self-sacrifice so as not to alienate potential voters.     PLATFORM TRACKER | Compare the party platforms on top election issues    During election campaigns, people are perhaps more accustomed to being told what they will get from a party, not what they will have to give up.   It is more difficult for political parties to suggest substantive personal sacrifices to tackle CO2 emissions.  ""The thing is with science, it is apolitical,"" said Seth Wynes, a PhD student at the University of British Columbia. Wynes researches the personal choices that have the highest impact on climate change.  ""And so the science tells us that we need to make drastic changes in our society if we want to mitigate climate change,"" Wynes said.  Science may be apolitical, drastic solutions usually aren't.  What are we willing to do?  The Canadian discussion around climate change is often contextualized around taxes — carbon and otherwise.   Writing about a recent poll commissioned by CBC News and conducted by Public Square Research and Maruu002FBlue, Éric Grenier said, ""while nearly two-thirds of Canadians see fighting climate change as a top priority, half of those surveyed would not shell out more than $100 per year in taxes to prevent climate change, the equivalent of less than $9 a month.""  That's about paying more, but then there's also the question of what you'd give up.      VOTE COMPASS | How do your views align with the parties?     Seth Wynes says switching to energy efficient light bulbs, recycling and eliminating plastic bags isn't going to cut it. His suggestions: fly less, have fewer kids, give up the car or go electric, and try a plant-based diet. Such recommendations are becoming more common discussion points in the global conversation around climate change.     Hundreds of young Canadians have pledged not to have any kids until the government gets serious about tackling climate change. In Vancouver, some academics are trying to limit flying. And the United Nations is recommending people eat less meat.   While these ideas may seem pretty ""out there,"" and there is no consensus around the necessity of such recommendations, they are, and will continue to be, debated, challenged and scrutinized. But not likely on the campaign trail.   ""Sometimes those drastic changes might not seem palatable to politicians,"" Wynes said.  Who is suggesting what?  Let's take a look at what the parties are saying as gathered on our very own CBC News interactive on the party platforms:  The Liberals' controversial carbon tax remains the centrepiece of the party's climate change plan. The tax is currently $20u002Ftonne of greenhouse gas emissions, or roughly 4.4 centsu002Flitre of gasoline. It will climb $10u002Ftonne every year until it reaches $50u002Ftonne in 2022. And there will be rebates for many Canadians.  The Liberals also say they will phase out coal power by 2030, ban single use plastics by 2021, and end some fuel subsidies by 2025.   The Conservatives promise to reduce carbon emissions by investing in green technology, funded in part by polluters who fail to meet new standards. But it's unclear which industry would be targeted or how much they would have to pay.  The New Democrats are in favour of continuing with a carbon tax and the rebate program. However, Leader Jagmeet Singh wants to crack down more on heavy emitters.   Green Party Leader Elizabeth May supports the carbon tax. She says putting a price on carbon has been ""one of the cornerstones of Green Party climate policy for many years."" She feels the climate reduction target Canada agreed to is not sufficient and hopes to double it.     Sign up for our Canada Votes newsletter    The Bloc Québécois is in favour of a carbon tax and is pushing for green equalization payments. They envision higher taxes for provinces with greater greenhouse gas emissions.   The People's Party plans to get rid of the carbon tax and will allow provinces to voluntarily reduce emissions.  The merits of each of the above plans will be hotly contested — politically, socially and scientifically. Yet the core idea is there for each party: ""something needs to be done, so we are going to do something."" That something primarily involves taxes.   In fairness, it's possible more specific details will come out during the campaign. But it's unlikely we'll see platforms recommending fewer children or less meat.  Even when it comes to carbon taxes, there are criticisms that the plans are weak on specific details.  Bold promises and reluctance  ""This is what politicians tend to do,"" Hoberg said.   To look at the two biggest parties, political pressure may be preventing either the Liberals or Conservatives from putting forward highly specific numbers that would meet Canada's Paris commitment.   ""They tend to put forward bold promises but are reluctant to commit themselves to significant actions that may cost constituencies that are very important to them and obviously to the Conservatives,"" he said.  When it comes to tackling climate change, the oft-touted goal is to meet our commitments under the Paris Agreement. Canada has pledged to an economy-wide target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030.       Fighting climate change is not like fighting a war. It's harder     ""None of the expert community that analyzes climate policies considers the Conservative plan a real plan,"" said Hoberg.   ""The Conservatives have a target but they don't have a plan that can plausibly meet that target,"" he said.  But, Hoberg says, while it's easier to measure the potential impact of the Liberal plan, that, too, will fall short of Canada's 2030 targets.    ""Their plan is stronger and more coherent but also comes short of meeting their goal,"" he said.  The Office of the Parliamentary Budget Officer has estimated the carbon tax will have to double from its projected 2022 rate to $102u002Ftonne in order for Canada to meet its 2030 Paris Agreement target. Trying to sell numbers like that could cost votes.  ""Climate policy has been extremely polarizing within the federal electoral environment,"" Hoberg said.   While the Conservatives fear upsetting their base in Alberta and Saskatchewan, the Liberals may be held back by opposition to the carbon tax in a number of provinces, including vote rich Ontario, where 121 seats are up for grabs.   ""It has been very politically challenging for him [Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau], especially given the opposition coming from Alberta and now from Ontario as well,"" said Hoberg.  According to poll aggregator 338Canada.com, the Liberals have just 15 seats considered ""safe"" in Ontario and another 33 identified as ""likely"" wins.      CBC News Interactive: Swing ridings     Hoberg recalls that in 2008, when former Liberal leader Stephane Dion introduced the Green Shift plan, it drew fire from then Conservative leader Stephen Harper — and likely cost the Liberals the election.  He says current Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer has adopted ""many of the same rhetorical tactics and political strategies"" that Harper did.  Bratt agrees the debate hasn't changed much over the years.  ""The Liberals are saying if you don't support the federal carbon tax, you're a climate change denier; and the Conservatives, on the other hand, say that the carbon tax has nothing to do with the climate, it's simply a tax grab,"" he said.  This is the debate over a carbon tax, no less a debate over the idea of giving up vacations that require airplanes, watermelon in February, or that third child.  We're not ready  ""The public isn't prepared for that kind of discussion,"" said David Taras, a professor of communication studies at Calgary's Mount Royal University.   ""The public doesn't have ears yet to listen to this, and the parties could look foolish, extreme, bizarre and marginal.""  ""Those are the dangers, that you're just so out of kilter with public expectations that you're ridiculed,"" said Taras.   Taras says politicians like to deliver ""goodies"" during campaigns, not lectures about how voters need to change their lives.  ""To have a serious discussion about climate change is not handing out goodies. It's, in fact, a change in lifestyle and getting people to make sacrifices. That's a whole different order of magnitude, and it's dangerous waters for politicians,"" he said.    The survey mentioned in this story was commissioned by CBC News and conducted by Public Square Research and Maruu002FBlue. It was conducted between May 31 and June 10, 2019, interviewing 4,500 eligible voters. Respondents for this survey were selected from among those who have registered to participate in the Maru Voice panel. The data have been weighted to reflect the demographic composition of Canada, according to Statistics Canada. Because the sample is based on those who initially self-selected for participation in the Maru Voice panel rather than a probability sample, no estimates of sampling error can be calculated. However, comparable samples of this size have a margin of error of +u002F- 1.5 per cent, 19 times out of 20.    Bryan Labby is an enterprise reporter with CBC Calgary.

119,New giant salamander species now the world's largest amphibian,"Scientists have discovered a new species of giant salamander and concluded that the largest amphibian ever recorded was a member of that species.  For a long time, scientists thought all Chinese giant salamanders, belonged to a single species, Andrias davidianus that was considered the largest amphibian in the world,  But now a genetic study of museum specimens in Canada, the U.K. and the U.S., shows there are actually three different species that live in three different river systems and mountain ranges in China.  And in fact, the largest Chinese giant salamander specimen ever recorded — a 1.8-metre-long individual bigger than most humans —  was likely a member of a newly named species from the Pearl River system in Southern China. The species is now known as the South China giant salamander and given the scientific name Andrias sligoi, scientists report this week in the journal Ecology and Evolution.  ""For me, the big take-home message is how shocking it is that [we are] just beginning to realize that world's largest amphibians are actually multiple species,"" said Samuel Turvey, a professor at the Institute of Zoology at the Zoological Society of London and lead author of the new study.  The original name for all Chinese giant salamanders, Andrias davidianus, now applies only the the species from the Yangtze river system.  A third species has also been identified from samples collected by Bob Murphy, senior curator of herpetology at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, in the Yellow Mountains of China in the 1990s. But because those samples represented only parts of animals rather than whole specimens, it could not be officially named as a new species.    Unfortunately, the museum specimens that were analyzed had been dried or preserved in different ways that made it difficult to tell what they looked like originally, which means researchers don't actually know how physically different the different species are.  Giant salamanders aren't colourful like frogs and newts.  ""They're these wonderful, weird, big brown blobs, really without that much to differentiate one individual from another,"" Turvey said.  He added that researchers are now hoping to find some living specimens of each species so they can learn how to tell them apart. Nor do they know if the different species can interbreed, although their last common ancestor was quite a while ago — more than 3 million years — and they were geographically isolated, so they would never encounter each other in the wild.  Sadly, all three species, if they still exist, ""are on the very, very edge of extinction,"" said Turvey.   They're so rare that a huge, ""exhaustive"" survey that Turvey conducted with Chinese scientists between 2013 to 2016 at almost 100 different sites where giant salamanders were expected to be found turned up only a handful of animals that, based on their genetic profile, likely escaped or were deliberately released from farms.  ""Which necessarily doesn't mean that these species are extinct, but it means that they are far, far, far rarer and more threatened than we expected,"" Turvey said.  Farming: a problem and a solution?  The species are rare in the wild partly because of poaching to stock farms that raise them as a delicacy.  ""The farming industry is a huge problem for salamander conservation, but it's there, and it's probably there to stay,"" Turvey said. Because of that, he said, it needs to be viewed as a resource for conservation.    An earlier genetic study of captive individuals suggested that they might include multiple lineages and even species, but farmed animals have been moved around so much that it was impossible to tell where those lineages might have originated.  That's what prompted the researchers to turn to museum specimens collected in the early 20th century, before the giant salamander farming industry began.  The discovery that there are multiple species is a ""game changer"" for conservation, Turvey said, as it means giant salamanders can't simply been raised in captivity and released into the wild from the nearest farm, as has been common practice.  The good news, he said, is ""it's certainly likely that many if not all of these species still exist within farms, shortly about to be sent to restaurants.""  Those could potentially be identified, bred in captivity, and released back into the wild in the right river systems.  The new Pearl River species' scientific name comes from the name originally given to one of the specimens used in the study. It was found in the Hong Kong Botanical Gardens in the 1920s, after being flushed out of a pipe or pool during a storm. It had likely been released as some kind of temple offering, Turvey said.   The animal was studied and named Megalobatrachus sligoi after the Duke of Sligo, who was visiting Hong Kong at the time, but was later reidentified with the scientific name for all Chinese giant salamanders until now, Andrias davidianus.  That animal was sent to the London Zoo, where it lived for 20 years before it died and became a specimen at the Natural History Museum in London.",technology
120,Toronto's Haviah Mighty wins 2019 Polaris Music Prize,"Haviah Mighty has won the 2019 Polaris Music Prize for her album 13th Floor.  The project, the first Polaris awarded to a female hip-hop and rap artist, was selected by an 11-member jury as the Canadian album of the year based on its artistic merit.  Mighty's first full-length solo album 13th Floor reflects on her experience as a woman of colour growing up in Canada, addressing the hurdles it presented, but also the positive inspiration her family provided. It features guest appearances by other rising Canadian rap artists, including Clairmont the Second, Sean Leon and her older sister Omega.  Mighty said the title was inspired by the concept of the 13th floor being a space North American culture pretends doesn't exist. The album draws a parallel between the 13th floor and marginalized people and communities, whose experiences she says often go unacknowledged.  She accepted the Polaris Prize saying that it's one of the few accolades she's received from years of making music, but she was grateful that her album resonated with the jury.  ""My truth, how important it is, and how dismissed it often is, I don't care about that,"" the Brampton, Ont.-raised artist said while accepting the award.  ""I've had the same thoughts and the same sentiments since high school, and every time it was 'not the time,' and it 'wasn't the place,' and here at the Polaris 2019 it is the time and the place.""  Mighty has been releasing music for a decade as an independent artist, and is also a member of all-female Toronto hip-hop act The Sorority.  The Polaris Prize is considered one of the country's most prestigious music awards. Former winners include Jeremy Dutcher, Arcade Fire, Buffy Sainte-Marie and Kaytranada.  The winner receives a $50,000 cash prize and heightened global awareness for their album.",entertainment
121,Welcome to Orcland: Amazon's Lord of the Rings to return to New Zealand,"Amazon announced Wednesday it will film its upcoming series The Lord of the Rings in New Zealand, marking a return of the orcs, elves and hobbits to the country they became synonymous with over the course of six movies directed by Peter Jackson.  Amazon Studios said it had found a great location with world-class sets and skilled staff. It said pre-production had already started and production on the series would begin in the city of Auckland over the coming months.  ""As we searched for the location in which we could bring to life the primordial beauty of the Second Age of Middle-earth, we knew we needed to find somewhere majestic, with pristine coasts, forests, and mountains,"" showrunners and executive producers J.D. Payne and Patrick McKay wrote in a statement.  But Amazon wouldn't reveal the extent of its plans for the series. It declined to say how much it plans to spend, how many seasons the show will run, or when it will debut.  Some have speculated Amazon could spend more than $1 billion (all figures US) on the series as it looks to take on other streaming services like Netflix with its Prime Video service.    New Zealand's Economic Development Minister Phil Twyford welcomed the news, saying the series would give a boost to the screen industry and create hundreds of new jobs.  ""It's a hugely significant piece of popular culture,"" Twyford said. ""And it now has a special place in New Zealanders hearts as well. We are part of Middle-earth.""    The series will be eligible for a 20 per cent screen grant rebate that will be funded by taxpayers. The conservative lobby group Taxpayers' Union said the rebate meant every New Zealand household could end up paying more than $100.  ""Who would seriously name Amazon as the most deserving recipient of our hard-earned tax dollars?"" the group wrote in a release.  But Twyford said it will be money well spent.  ""This is not a charity issue,"" he said. ""This is about bringing jobs, investment, and economic development to New Zealand.""    The series will be based on the fantasy novels by J.R.R. Tolkien. Amazon said it would explore new story lines that precede The Fellowship of the Ring.

122,Late-night talk shows take on Trudeau for brownface photos,"Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau got the wrong kind of international attention overnight as talk show hosts took jabs at him for dressing in brown- and blackface.  A photo from a 2001 yearbook shows Trudeau dressed as Aladdin at an ""Arabian Nights""-themed event at a Vancouver private school where he taught.  In the photo, Trudeau is clad in a turban and robe with his face, hands and neck covered in dark makeup.  As part of his opening segment, The Daily Show host Trevor Noah joked that Trudeau didn't even get the skin colour right for Aladdin.  He said — quote — ""Trudeau isn't dressed as Aladdin, he's dressed as Aladdin doing blackface.""    American talk-show host Stephen Colbert also mentioned the photo, calling it ""really bad.""  And Late Night host Seth Meyers said the photo is — quote — ""so bad that Canadians travelling in Europe are going to start telling people they're American.""",entertainment
123,"Cannabis product not the culprit in Ontario teen's vaping-related illness, health official says","The teen who was hospitalized with a severe vaping-related respiratory illness in London, Ont., did not use a cannabis-related product, the region's medical officer of health told CBC News.  The high-school aged person who fell ill earlier this year was in intensive care and has recovered.   Dr. Chris Mackie, medical officer of health and CEO of Middlesex-London Health Unit, said the person hadn't been vaping cannabis.  ""This person was not using those products"" that include tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, the main active ingredient in cannabis that gives users a high), Mackie said in an interview Friday. ""The person was vaping fairly heavily with a nicotine-based product.""  It is important for people to understand that the severe respiratory illness associated with vaping ""is not a remote risk"" but very real in Canada, he said.  A local physician reported an ""incident"" involving an e-cigarette product to a voluntary national database to flag potential problems related to consumer products.    But the database isn't detailed enough to classify someone as a confirmed or probable patient, said Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief medical officer of health.   There are three incident reports from across the country under investigation from the database, with at least one dating back to 2018, Tam said.    Tam did not reveal the health status of the individuals, their ages or where they're located. Rather, provinces still need to gather a thorough history of a patient's potential vaping, clinical symptoms and information on the products and devices used before any cases in the country could be confirmed.  Based on a Canadian version of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control's case definitions, Tam said physicians are on the lookout for patients with a history of vaping or e-cigarette use in the previous 90 days reporting respiratory illness such as:     Cough.   Shortness of breath.   Chest pain.   Fever.   Sometimes nausea and gastrointenstinal upset.    Doctors would first rule out any other infectious diseases before considering it a vaping-related case. As more health-care providers routinely ask people whether they vape, more suspected cases are expected to come to light.   ""If you don't vape, don't start,"" Tam said. ""Youth, pregnant women and non-smokers should not vape. Those who do vape should get their product from a regulated, approved source — for example for nicotine-vaping products. There are no current regulated sources of cannabis or THC-containing products.""  Tam said while cannabis and THC-containing products are readily available on the grey market, next month's regulations should afford protections. For instance, Health Canada will introduce rules on what ingredients can be in THC vape liquids and on how the products and devices are produced and monitored.     In the U.S., 530 confirmed and probable cases have been reported in 38 states and one U.S. territory, up from 380 a week ago. The country's eighth death was reported by state officials in Missouri on Thursday.   The CDC said most patients have reported a history of using e-cigarette products containing THC, many reported using THC and nicotine, and some have reported the use of e-cigarette products containing only nicotine.  'Paddling upstream' against marketing  No single device, ingredient, additive or pathway to illness has been identified in the U.S., federal officials there stressed.  Similarly, Mackie said his health unit is not identifying the brand used in the London case, because doing so could implicate one specific product when the international evidence isn't pointing that way.    Mackie said since Wednesday's news conference, he's received a backlash on social media from people who support vaping.  ""There is really a firm — I would say vicious — campaign on social media to criticize anyone speaking out against vaping,"" Mackie said.  Given that up to 90 per cent of teens in some of his city's schools report vaping, Mackie isn't deterred.  ""We're really paddling upstream with the amount of marketing of vaping that there is, and especially of those flavoured products which really appeal to youth.""",health
124,Green Party would decriminalize all drug possession if elected,"The Green Party would decriminalize all drug possession if elected in October, leader Elizabeth May said Saturday on the campaign trail in Winnipeg.  May said it's a necessary step to curb the opioid crisis in Canada.  ""We must stop treating drug addiction as a criminal issue. This is a national health emergency.""    May delivered the announcement in Manitoba, which is dealing with a major drug problem.  As part of their effort to lower the rate of overdose deaths, the Greens are also committing to declaring a national health emergency, increasing mental health and addiction programs, and funding community organizations. The party said it would also ensure kits with Naloxone, a medication that blocks the effects of opioids, are widely available to treat overdoses.  The issue is personal for the Green leader. Her sister-in-law, entertainer Margot Kidder, died in 2018 after battling drug addiction.  Much of the Green Party's current support comes from the Lower Mainland of British Columbia, and Vancouver Island, areas hit hard by the opioid problem, which led to the deaths of nearly 4,000 Canadians in 2017.    May said her party would consider lifting the decriminalization in the future if the drug crisis subsides.   Earlier this month, May told CBC News it's time the federal government declared the opioid crisis a national emergency and decriminalized illicit drugs to prevent deaths.  People on the front lines of the crisis have long said creating a supply of clean drugs and removing the criminal element would cut down on the number of overdose deaths.  On Saturday in Winnipeg, May said health care in Canada must ""accommodate, prepare and save lives.""  Weighing in on drug concerns  This year, a Statistics Canada report blamed stagnating life expectancy rates on deadly overdoses.  The Liberals have rejected calls to decriminalize all drugs, sticking instead with the legalization of marijuana — a 2015 campaign promise that was fulfilled last year.    Neither the Liberals nor the Conservatives have released their 2019 platforms, including on what they would do in the area of illicit drugs and how to reduce death rates.  The NDP's platform says the party would ""commit to working with all levels of government, experts and Canadians to end the criminalization and stigma of drug addiction.""",health
125,"Nearly 1,500 die from opioid overdoses last year in Ontario, up from 2017","Newly released provincial data show that nearly 1,500 Ontarians died from opioid overdoses last year.  Public Health Ontario has released updated statistics showing 1,473 people died from opioid-related causes in 2018, a jump of about 17 per cent from the previous year.  In 2017, a total of 1,261 people died from an opioid overdose, which was a roughly 45 per cent increase from 2016, when 867 people died.  The new data also show a spike of 2,973 emergency department visits due to opioid overdoses during the first three months of 2019.    That's an increase over the same period in 2018, which saw 1,843 emergency department visits caused by opioid overdoses.

126,Outspoken Imperial Oil CEO Rich Kruger to step down at end of year,"One of the oilpatch's most outspoken critics of Canadian federal and provincial energy policy is retiring at the end of this year.  Imperial Oil Ltd. announced Tuesday that chairman and chief executive Rich Kruger will step down after leading the Calgary-based company, which is about 70 per cent owned by Texas-based Exxon Mobil Corp., since 2013.  In his role, Kruger complained publicly often about red tape, focusing in recent years on how long it took to win Alberta regulatory approval for the two-phase, 150,000-barrel-per-day Aspen thermal oilsands project, first proposed in 2013.  Imperial announced it would go ahead with Aspen late last year, within months of finally winning approval for the $2.6-billion project.  But it was put on hold in March due to what Kruger called market uncertainty caused in part by the former provincial NDP government's oil production curtailment program enacted in January to reduce a glut of oil trapped by output outgrowing pipeline capacity.  ""We cannot invest billions of dollars on behalf of our shareholders given the uncertainty in the current business environment,"" he said at the time.  The CEO has also taken the federal government to task over Canadian competitiveness, calling for tax parity with the U.S. and declaring Ottawa's passage of Bill C-69 to revamp how energy projects are approved would cause Imperial to reconsider any new investments in Canada.  In August, Kruger threatened to drastically reduce Imperial's crude-by-rail shipments because provincial curtailments had hurt the profitability of shipping by rail to the U.S. Gulf Coast.  He charged the programs were ""no way to run a railroad"" and added he didn't agree with rivals Suncor Energy Inc. and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. that the government should reduce curtailments for companies that add rail export capacity.  ""The last thing we want to do is ingrain the concept of curtailment, that you get relief from curtailment if you get rail,"" he said on a conference call. ""I want relief from curtailment and no curtailment. I want it done!""  While CEO, Kruger oversaw the successful construction and commissioning of the second phase of Imperial's Kearl oilsands mining project.  He was not available for an interview on Tuesday.  ""We believe it is fair to say that Rich brought a substantially higher level of intensity to the platform than the one he inherited when he joined Imperial in 2013 and that there will be some lasting effect from his tenure in the seat,"" said analyst Jon Morrison of CIBC Capital Markets in a report.  The CEO was born in Minnesota and trained as a mechanical engineer. He began his career at Exxon in 1981 and held various technical and management positions in posts in the former Soviet Union, Africa, Asia-Pacific and the Middle East before coming to Canada.  Financial analysts said they expect little change in direction under Brad Corson, a 36-year Exxon employee who will take over as president immediately and become chairman and CEO on Jan. 1.  Corson, who was born in Illinois, joined Exxon in 1983 as a project engineer and has held a variety of technical, operations, commercial and managerial assignments around the world, including leadership positions in Hong Kong and London.  He was appointed president, ExxonMobil Upstream Ventures, in 2015, where he was responsible for ExxonMobil's global upstream acquisition and divestment programs.",business
127,"Goodbye, Three Mile Island: Remaining reactor shuts down","The money-losing Three Mile Island, the 1979 site of the United States's worst commercial nuclear power accident, was shut down Friday by its energy giant owner.  The end of the 45-year electricity-producing career of Three Mile Island Unit 1 came after Chicago-based Exelon Corp. tried and failed to get financial aid from Pennsylvania in the spring.  Unit 1 opened in 1974 and was licensed to operate through 2034, but Exelon complained the plant was losing money in competitive electricity markets.  Three Mile Island also faced particularly difficult economics because the 1979 accident that destroyed Unit 2 left it with just one reactor.  Decommissioning Unit 1, dismantling its buildings and removing spent fuel could take six decades and cost more than $1 billion US, Exelon estimates, although companies specializing in the handling of radioactive material are buying retired U.S. nuclear reactors and promising to do it in under a decade.    The destroyed Unit 2 is sealed, and its twin cooling towers remain standing. Its core was shipped years ago to the U.S. Department of Energy's Idaho National Laboratory. What is left inside the containment building remains highly radioactive and encased in concrete.  Work to dismantle Unit 2 is scheduled to begin in 2041 and be completed in 2053, its owner, FirstEnergy, has said.  No nuclear plant proposed after the 1979 accident has been successfully completed and put into operation in the U.S.",technology
128,Go behind the scenes of the new Leonard Cohen album,"Howard Bilerman always dreamed of recording Leonard Cohen. He even pitched unsolicited proposals to the legendary poet-singer through the mail slot of his Montreal home in the 1990s, when he was just in his 20s.  So working on a Cohen album was an exciting experience for the 48-year-old engineer and co-owner of the hotel2tango recording studio in the city's Mile-End neighbourhood.  ""Imagine being in the position to be able to push the solo button on that,"" he said about isolating Cohen's intense, gravely voice on his studio mixing board. ""That was me.""  Cohen's son Adam had asked Bilerman and Montreal singer-songwriter Patrick Watson to add music to some of his father's solo vocals, which had previously been recorded in Los Angeles, in June 2016.     One of the songs, The Hills, was originally slated to be on Cohen's album You Want It Darker — which came out 19 days before his death that November — but wasn't ready.  Instead, it and eight other unfinished Cohen compositions will be released on the posthumous album Thanks For The Dance, out Nov. 22.   ""The record is fantastic,"" said Bilerman, who says it feels like a classic Cohen record — not one of those ""we're combing the archives for anything that we can cobble together"" albums.    In addition to recording parts of The Hills, Bilerman also helped set up Adam's home studio in L.A., a converted garage, where much of the new record was produced.  Adam had flown him down to California for Cohen's memorial service in December 2016. That was where The Hills was played publicly for the first time, as a musical backdrop to a video montage Adam had made to honour his father's life.  ""It took me about five seconds to realize, 'Oh my God that's the song that we did,'"" said Bilerman, ""I just immediately started bawling.""    Long shadow  But it wasn't the only time Adam called on his friend while making Thanks For The Dance.  In May 2018, he asked Bilerman to host famed musician-producer Daniel Lanois at hotel2tango to get his feedback on the project.  ""I don't even think the session started out as, 'Let's have Daniel Lanois play on [the] record,'"" Bilerman said. But after hearing the first song, he says, Lanois was reaching for a 12-string guitar.  ""Within two hours he had played six different instruments and sang,"" said Bilerman. ""Ideas were just oozing out of him.""  Bilerman says even Lanois, who has helmed records for giants like U2 and Bob Dylan, was humbled by the long artistic shadow cast by Cohen, even after death.  ""I feel like Daniel showed up in complete reverence to Leonard and his music,"" he said.     'Great love and pride'  Bilerman's involvement in Thanks For The Dance morphed out of his experience recording the choir from the Cohen family's synagogue for the song You Want It Darker, which won a Grammy for best rock performance in 2018  The Shaar Hashomayim choir also appears on the song Puppets on the new record, although it wasn't recorded by Bilerman.  The choir's cantor Gideon Zelermyer was tight-lipped about the recording process but says it was a tremendous honour to have played a small role in what he calls ""amazing statements"" by Cohen near the end of his life.  Zelermyer says the choir didn't hesitate when Adam called on them again.   ""He felt we had something to add to the statement so we did [it] with great love and pride,"" he said.  The new album also features performances from creative luminaries including Jennifer Warnes, Javier Mas, Feist and Richard Reed Parry of Arcade Fire.    More unreleased material   Adam says he's been moved by the response of those who've already heard Thanks For The Dance. And Zelermyer says he thinks the song his choir sang on, ""rises to the level of any of Leonard's greatest works.""  Bilerman agrees: ""It's heartbreaking to hear that voice and hear those songs,"" he said.  ""I think it's going to be really moving for people.""  He says besides the new album, more unreleased material could find its way out of the vaults.  ""I know for a fact that one of my favourite songs was left off of it."" he said. ""I'd love for it to see the light of day too.""",entertainment
129,Major oil company plans 7 wells in Alaska petroleum reserve,"A major oil company will drill seven new exploratory wells in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska.  ConocoPhillips is planning the work for this winter, the Alaska Journal of Commerce reported.  The wells will be focused on the prospective Harpoon area southwest of the company's existing projects in the reserve, ConocoPhillips Alaska vice-president Scott Jepsen said during a presentation last week to the Alaska Support Industry Alliance. The wells will better delineate the large Willow prospect.  ""We want to get more confidence around the geology and reservoir characteristics of the field, so that's one of the reasons we pushed back our startup date to around 2025-26 now for the Willow development,"" Jepsen said.  ConocoPhillips announced the Willow discovery in early 2017. The company estimates it could produce 130,000 barrels per day at its peak.  Other company plans call for shooting three-dimensional seismic data around the Putu prospect near the village of Nuiqsut. The work will require about 265 kilometres of ice roads, Jepsen said.    ""Hopefully the weather will co-operate and we'll be able to accomplish all this,"" he said.  ConocoPhillips in June announced purchase of the Nuna project from Dallas-based independent Caelus Energy. Caelus sanctioned Nuna in March 2015 and indicated that it had authorized $480 million US of expenditures on the project to that point. Caelus estimated up to 20,000 barrels per day from the project.  Jepsen said Nuna will be part of the Kuparuk River Unit and its oil will be processed through Kuparuk facilities, lowering development cost. Drilling will be done from the Nuna pad and a Kuparuk pad to minimize new infrastructure costs.  The company expects 400 labourers over one winter construction season will be able to prep the project for first production in 2022.",business
130,"Iran says detained British oil tanker is free to leave, but no timetable given","An Iranian government spokesperson said Monday that all legal steps had been completed for the release of the detained British-flagged tanker Stena Impero, but he did not know when the vessel would be released, Iranian media reported.  ""The legal work for the oil tanker is over ... and the oil tanker can move, and the decisions indicate the end of the detention,"" government spokesperson Ali Rabiei was quoted as saying by the semi-official Fars news agency. He did not elaborate.  The July 19 seizure of the ship, two weeks after Britain detained an Iranian tanker off Gibraltar, has cranked up tensions in the region in the wake of attacks on other merchant vessels that Washington blamed on Tehran.  Iran denied responsibility for those attacks along the Strait of Hormuz, a vital international oil shipping route.  ""The legal work and administrative procedures for the release of the English tanker have been completed, but I have no information on the time of the release,"" Rabiei said, according to semi-official news agency ILNA.  Relations between the United States, its allies and Iran have been gradually more strained since Washington withdrew last year from a global pact aimed at reining in Tehran's nuclear program and imposed sanctions on it aimed at shutting down Iranian oil exports.",business
131,"Price-fixing conspiracy lawsuits can go ahead against electronics companies, Supreme Court rules","The Supreme Court of Canada has given the green light to a pair of British Columbia class-action suits alleging a global price-fixing conspiracy by electronics firms.  The suits, filed by Whistler, B.C., businessman Neil Godfrey, allege the companies overcharged buyers of optical disc drives and products containing them, such as computers and video-game consoles.  The cases, involving more than 40 defendants — including powerhouses such as Sony, Toshiba, Samsung, Philips, Panasonic and Pioneer — were certified as class actions, decisions upheld on appeal.  Godfrey is seeking compensation for all B.C. residents who purchased the products between Jan. 1, 2004, and Jan. 1, 2010.  The proposed class also includes so-called umbrella purchasers — people who bought products that were not made or supplied by the companies in question — based on the theory that the conspiracy led other manufacturers to set higher prices as well.  Godfrey launched the main action in September 2010, but a separate one against Pioneer did not come until August 2013, leading the company to argue it began after the expiry of a two-year limitation period.",business
132,UN turns to young people for hope and vitality in climate fight,"The United Nations hopes the presence of hundreds of young people will motivate governments and corporations to take bold climate action when world leaders meet in New York City for the annual UN General Assembly next week.  On Saturday, one day after thousands of people across the planet hold marches, rallies and strikes to demand an end to the use of fossil fuels, the UN will host its first-ever Youth Climate Summit.  ""It makes utter sense that their voice be front and centre going forward now,"" says Bill McKibben co-founder of 350.org, one of the main organizers of Friday's Global Climate Strike.  The current generation of young people is the largest in human history, McKibben says. There are an estimated 1.8 billion people aged between 10 and 24.  That should make it harder for leaders to be cynical and obstructionist, ""when there are young people saying, 'guys our lives are on the line,'"" McKibben says.  ""Older people are at their best when they are thinking about the generations that come after them, when they are actually, really worrying about their children and their grandchildren.""      We're very creative in developing novel solutions and aren't afraid to create radical solutions that are completely out of the ordinary.  - Brandon Nguyen, Canadian participant     Young people are expected to bring a mix of enthusiasm, innovation, and guilt to the climate discussion that organizers hope will help jolt countries into raising their national pledges when it comes to reducing heat-trapping emissions.  ''Basically, we need to duplicate, and in some cases triplicate, what the countries have pledged in Paris to keep the temperature below to 1.5 C,"" Luis Alfonso de Alba, the UN special envoy on climate change, said this week.    Young people represent a ""powerful force"" in the fight to achieve the targets set out in the landmark 2015 agreement, he said.  ''They are consumers, they are voters, they are professionals … their own commitments could be quite significant.''  Harjeet Singh, the global lead on climate change with the charity ActionAid International, says he's not surprised the UN has decided to give ""a formal seat at the table"" to young people.  ""This is where the UN system is finding the most energy and positivity.""  Green ticket winners  The reluctant star of the Youth Climate Summit will undoubtedly be 16-year-old Swedish phenom Greta Thunberg, who started a global movement one year ago when she skipped school to sit in front of the Swedish parliament demanding political leaders do more to protect the environment.  Thunberg will be joined in New York by some 700 young activists, including 100 ""climate champions"" from around the world who have been awarded so-called green tickets to attend the summit.  The UN has provided them with ""fully-funded, carbon-neutral travel to NYC"" and about $430 US in per diems to cover food and lodging.    Pramisha Thapaliya from Nepal felt ""honoured, privileged and a huge sense of responsibility"" when she was told she'd won a free ticket to the summit.  The 22-year-old holds a degree in agricultural science and hopes one day to become the minister of Forest and Environment in her country.  Read the complete program for the Youth Climate Summit here  ""Young people are bold and desperate,"" declared Maja Starosta from Poland. ""What we can do is push [leaders] with our presence.""

Her wish is to convince fellow lawyers to stop working for fossil fuel industries.  Young see more at stake — poll  ""Imagine,"" she says, ""we could end global warming.""  A majority of teenagers in the U.S. believe global warming is caused by humans and that it will personally hurt them and their generation, the Washington Post reported earlier this week, citing a poll it did with the Kaiser Family Foundation.  ""Young people have a lot more at stake when it comes to these issues,"" says Brandon Nguyen, Canada's green ticket winner. The 19-year-old university student created a forum to connect high-school environment clubs in Toronto.  He also worked with NGOs to develop curriculums on renewable energy for teachers across Canada. ""Collaboration on this scale and backed by the UN is basically unprecedented,"" says Nguyen.  He also thinks the youth summit is a no-brainer. ""We're very creative in developing novel solutions and aren't afraid to create radical solutions that are completely out of the ordinary.""    Haya Almansoori from the United Arab Emirates admits she's ""not that into sciences"" but likes exploring which is what led her to discover a new way to generate electricity using heated sand when she was sixteen and still in high-school.  She plans to give out copies of her research to policymakers and business leaders when she is in New York. The 20-year-old also helped build a greenhouse out of 25,500 plastic water bottles at the American University of Sharjah, north of Dubai, where she is taking international studies.  ""It was really fun,"" said  Almansoori of  the three-year project.  And yet while some explore alternative solutions, others are quickly running out of options.  Komal Kumar says at least three villages in Fiji have already been relocated to higher ground because of rising sea levels — caused by melting ice sheets and glaciers — while another 435 communities have been identified as being ""at risk.""  The 27-year-old has a degree in public health. She's now doing a master's with a focus on climate-induced relocation.  ""It's very sad to know that this is actually happening,"" says Kumar.  Planned relocation guidelines  People are not just leaving behind the land where their ancestors are buried. Many in the Pacific region also feel like ""they're leaving behind their identity.""  In December, the government of Fiji laid out its Planned Relocation Guidelines. Kumar is looking into the impact the new policy is having on affected populations.  She will join Thunberg and Secretary General Antonio Guterres in delivering opening remarks at the Youth Climate Summit on Saturday.  Commitments put forward by the participants will be presented via video during the opening ceremony of the leaders' summit on Monday.  Scaled up and replicated  Thunberg and two other young people will take to the stage with the UN secretary general to present climate demands and solutions to world leaders gathered in the General Assembly hall.  The UN says those ideas ""which can be scaled up and replicated"" will be included in the secretary general's outcome report.  ""Everyone is really looking forward to it,"" says Kumar. ""Just to point out to the world leaders 'you know, this is what we want, and this is what you have to do, so you will have to accept it because this is our future that you are talking about, and you don't have the authority to come over and tell us that … we cannot meet your demands.'""  The leaders' summit, which will include private sector pledges, is being used as a springboard to 2020, when as many as 30,000 delegates will meet in Glasgow for the 26th Conference of the Parties, known as COP26, and the crucial implementation phase of the Paris Agreement is set to begin.",technology
133,"Trudeau not acting in 'good faith' on PBO platform costing, economist says","Justin Trudeau's Liberals have ""gamed"" a process the party itself created to increase the transparency of fiscal promises during elections, an economist says.  In their 2015 platform, the Liberals pledged to expand the mandate of the Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO) to include the estimated costs of various campaign commitments. They said at the time it ""would help Canadians make informed decisions"" and give voters a ""credible, non-partisan way to compare each party's fiscal plans.""  The proposal was enshrined in legislation after the Liberals formed government, making the current election campaign the first under the PBO's expanded mandate.  Unlike the Tories and New Democrats, however, the Liberals have so far neglected to release PBO estimates for the nearly $4 billion worth of campaign promises they've made to date.    While Trudeau said Wednesday that his campaign will release a fully-costed platform, along with the PBO's analysis of big ticket items, ""in the coming weeks,"" some are asking whether the Liberals are flouting the spirit of a process they created.  ""The NDP and the Conservatives came to the table to engage in good faith, and I think a lot of people had assumed the Liberals would do the same,"" said Rob Gillezeau, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Victoria, who once worked in the office of former NDP leader Tom Mulcair.   ""Good faith"" matters because the parties' participation in the process is voluntary. And the PBO can only release a cost estimate of a particular promise with written permission from the party that requested it.  Other parties left 'burned'  That means that if Trudeau's campaign has received results from the PBO, it has decided to sit on them until a later date.  The PBO's guidelines do not expressly state that cost estimates need to be released alongside announcements, but Gillezeau said that was widely understood to be the practice when the policy was developed.    ""I think the fact that one of the major parties decided to play politics with it has been really damaging,"" said Gillezeau.  According to the Liberal campaign, many of the measures it intends to roll out are interrelated. A series of individual cost estimates would fail to capture the bigger picture of its fiscal plan, a party spokesperson said.  Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer argued that the Liberals are trying to limit scrutiny of their ""terrible fiscal record.""    Gillezeau said the Liberals' decision to make platform announcements without accompanying cost estimates has undermined the transparency the new PBO process was meant to foster.  ""For the other parties that took a chance and engaged, they are probably feeling a little burned,"" he said.  Tactical campaign decision  Mostafa Askari, chief economist at the Institute of Fiscal Studies and Democracy at the University of Ottawa, said that the Liberal approach is ""frustrating"" for the public — but there's still plenty of time left in the campaign for financial transparency.  ""The spirit of the legislation is that all of the party's fiscal measures should be costed by the PBO. When to release them — that's a different issue,"" said Askari, who served as deputy PBO for nearly a decade until he left the role in 2018.  ""The parties have their own strategies and tactics for releasing this kind of information.""  Waiting to publish cost estimates means more time to modify proposals or react to what rival parties have rolled out on the trail, he added.  The move to expand the PBO mandate to include analysis of election promises was not applauded by everyone when it was first floated. Ken Boessenkool, a long-time Conservative staffer at both the federal and provincial levels, was among the critics.    Boessenkool, who calls himself an ""early and persistent"" opponent of broadening the purview of the PBO to include elections, said that parties themselves should bear the responsibility for credibly costing their platforms. He was behind the Ontario Progressive Conservatives' decision to have one of their recent platforms independently analyzed by Kevin Page, Canada's former PBO.  ""It was a signal to the public that the party was serious,"" said Boessenkool, currently a partner at KTG Public Affairs.  A non-partisan government institution like the PBO should have no role in campaigns, which are inherently partisan exercises, he said.  The current politicking over the PBO's cost estimates for Liberal promises seems to be validating those concerns, Gillezeau said.",politics

As a result of the disorder, her daughter has severe digestive and gastro-intestinal reflux issues and has been unable to keep anything down except for a formula called Puramino A+.   ""She was vomiting 24u002F7, almost every single feed. She was screaming,"" said Wilkinson.   Aside from physiotherapy and cardiologist appointments, her parents have been worrying about the $200 a week price tag. Because they have private insurance, OHIP+ doesn't cover it. However, their private insurance won't pay for it, either.   ""It's not a choice. We're not choosing to put our daughter on this.""    This spring, Ontario rolled back a Liberal plan that covered all prescriptions for people under 25. The province will now only cover drug costs for people under 25 who don't have private health insurance. The move was projected to save $250 million.      How young women's access to birth control in Ontario will change April 1   OHIP+ no longer covers kids, young adults with private insurance, new health minister says    Natalie Mehra, president of the Ontario Health Coalition, said she was ""shocked and appalled"" by Wilkinson's situation.  ""It makes no sense to have a public health system and get a diagnosis, but you can't afford the cure.""   While Mehra said this is the first she's heard of the situation, France Gelinas, the NDP's health critic and MPP for Nickel Belt, says she knows of several families who have similar problems.   In April, the New Democrats questioned Ontario Health Minister Christine Elliott about the story of a Niagara Falls mother who was paying $600 a month for the same formula. Elliott said she would look into it.   ""Don't balance the budget on the shoulders of sick, newborn babies,"" said Gelinas.     The Ministry of Health told CBC News families with high medication costs are eligible to be covered under the Trillium Drug Program. That involves paying an upfront deductible of four per cent of the household after-tax income.   Wilkinson says she and her husband are hesitant to apply because they don't yet know how long Adaline will need what her mother calls the ""lifesaving"" formula.   ""She's not able to have anything else.""",health
135,Muslim theatre company challenges perceptions with 'Spun' in Centaur debut ,"Should a British play about two Pakistani friends dealing with malicious whispers and microaggressions be rewritten to take place in Quebec?  That's one of the questions the artists at the Silk Road Institute asked themselves when they decided to perform Spun by Rabiah Hussain — a play about two friends living in London after the 2005 terror attacks.  The characters struggle to process how people's attitudes toward them changed after the bombing. One decides to distance herself from her roots, while the other embraces them.  The play — still firmly set in London — opens at the Centaur Theatre this week.   ""We thought this is perfect for bringing to Quebec audiences because when they first come into the world of the play, they're able to have some distance,"" said director Mercedeh Baroque.  She thinks that approaching it this way means Montreal audiences won't feel as self-conscious while watching the play.  By the end of the show, people will, ideally, walk away asking questions about what can be done in terms of Muslim representation in the media and politics, she said.  ""People need to know what kind of impact these discussions in the public sphere are having on young Muslims,"" Baroque said.    Enter Centaur Theatre  This is the second play by the Silk Road Institute, which initially billed itself as ""Canada's first professional theatre company dedicated to celebrating Muslim stories.""    Its first production, The Domestic Crusaders, was staged last year at a small space in Montreal's Notre-Dame-de-Grâce neighbourhood.  Centaur Theatre's artistic director Eda Holmes attended the show and was impressed by the company. She hoped to bring a future show to the Centaur stage.  ""Because they're the first self-identified Muslim theatre company in Montreal, I wanted to see their work,"" Holmes said.  She met Silk Road's founder, Mohamed Shaheen, who spoke about Spun and how relevant it would be for Canadian audiences.    They decided that staging it at Centaur, Montreal's oldest English-language theatre company, would be a way to get as many people invested in the conversation as possible.  Baroque, the director, hopes children and teenagers from minority groups in particular will attend the show.  ""Young people who are a part of a minority group have to deal with this coming-of-age struggle much sooner than the majority groups,"" she said.    She thinks the play will help them process how they are portrayed in the media, so that they can develop a healthier, more nuanced understanding of themselves and their culture.    For Holmes, it's another step toward cementing Centaur as a space that nurtures young artists in the city.  ""We're trying to expand everyone's notion of what English theatre can be in Montreal,"" Holmes said.    Spun is on at the Centaur Theatre (453 St-Francois Xavier Street) from September 19 to 28.",entertainment
136,Federal Green Party pledges investment in sustainable mining,"The leader of the federal Green Party of Canada is clarifying some misinformation about the party's stance on mining.  In the party's platform, there is a line that states that ""no new pipelines, or coal, oil or gas drilling or mining, including offshore wells, will be approved.""  The platform also states that the party plans to ""support the transition of the mining sector to an innovation hub for greener technologies.""  It also pledges $40 million for the proposed Sudbury-based mining innovation cluster.    Some have questioned what the promises mean for the mining sector.  Party leader Elizabeth May says the promise is meant to encourage more sustainable practices in mining.  ""This is from a Sudbury-based mining support consortium that want to ensure they can reduce their dependence on fuels and do more with electricity,"" she said.  ""It's entirely in favour of sustainable mining, not phasing out mining, that's a bizarre misinterpretation.""  May says the investment into greener technologies in mining could impact the market globally.",politics
137,U.S. central bank cuts interest rate again — but split on what to do next,"A sharply divided Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate Wednesday for a second time this year, but indicated it may not cut rates any further this year.  The Fed's move will reduce its benchmark rate — which influences many consumer and business loans — by an additional quarter point to a range of 1.75 per cent to 2 per cent.  The action was approved 7-3, with two officials preferring to keep rates unchanged and one arguing for a bigger half-point cut. It was the most Fed dissents in three years.  The divisions on the policy committee underscored the challenges confronting chairman Jerome Powell in guiding the Fed at time of high uncertainty in the U.S. economy.  Stock reaction  Stock prices tumbled after the Fed issued its statement, reflecting disappointment it had declined to indicate that more rate cuts are likely this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 150 points an hour later.  The economic expansion appears durable in its 11th year of growth, with a still-solid job market and steady consumer spending. But the Fed is trying to combat threats including uncertainties caused by President Donald Trump's trade war with China, slower global growth and a slump in American manufacturing. The Fed notes in a policy statement that ""business fixed investment and exports have weakened.""  The Fed's modest rate cut irritated Trump, who has attacked the central bank and insisted it slash rates more aggressively. The president immediately signalled his discontent on Twitter    Updated economic and interest rate forecasts issued Wednesday by the Fed show that only seven of 17 officials foresee at least one additional rate cut this year. And at least two Fed officials expect a rate hike next year.  None of the policymakers foresee rates falling below 1.5 per cent in 2020 — a sign the turbulence from a global slowdown and Trump's escalation of the trade war is viewed as manageable.  The median forecasts show the economy is expected to grow a modest 2.2 per cent this year, 2 per cent next year and 1.9 per cent in 2021. Those forecasts are well below the Trump administration's projection that the president's policies will accelerate growth to 3 per cent annually or better. But they also suggest policymakers do not envision a recession.    Unemployment is projected to be 3.7 per cent and inflation 1.5 per cent, below the Fed's target level of 2 per cent.  A resumption of trade talks between the Trump administration and Beijing and a less antagonistic tone between the two sides have supported the view that additional rate cuts might not be necessary. So has a belief that oil prices will remain elevated, that inflation might finally be reaching the Fed's target level and that there are increasing signs that the U.S. economy remains sturdy.  The job market looks solid, wages are rising, consumers are still spending, and even sluggish sectors such as manufacturing and construction have shown signs of rebounding.  Yet no one, perhaps not even the Fed, is sure of how interest rate policy will unfold in coming months. Too many uncertainties exist, notably the outcome of Trump's trade war.  Trump wants even lower rates  Trump has in the meantime kept up a stream of public attacks on the central bank's policymaking, including referring to Powell as an ""enemy"" and the Fed's policymakers as ""boneheads."" Even though the economy looks resilient, the president has insisted the Fed slash its benchmark rate more deeply — even to below zero, as the European Central Bank has done — part to weaken the U.S. dollar and make American exports more competitive.  Powell has said policymakers remain focused on sustaining the expansion and keeping prices stable without regard to any outside pressures.    The Fed is monitoring the global slowdown, especially in Europe, and the U.K.'s effort to leave the European Union. A disruptive Brexit could destabilize not just Europe but the U.S. economy, too.  U.S. inflation, which has long been dormant, has begun to show signs it is reaching the Fed's two per cent target and might remain there. If the Fed's policymakers conclude that inflation will sustain a faster pace, it might give them pause about cutting rates much further.  The most serious threat to the expansion is widely seen as Trump's trade war. The increased import taxes he has imposed on goods from China and Europe — and the counter-tariffs other nations have applied to U.S. exports — have hurt many American companies and paralyzed their plans for investment and expansion.  In recent days, the Trump administration and Beijing have acted to de-escalate tensions before a new round of trade talks planned for October in Washington. Yet most analysts foresee no significant agreement emerging this fall in the conflict, which is fundamentally over Beijing's aggressive drive to supplant America's technological dominance.",business
138,TSX closes at record high as oil rally continues,"The Toronto Stock Exchange's benchmark stock index closed at an all-time high of 16,899 on Friday as strong oil prices buoyed the market.  The S&amp;Pu002FTSX Composite Index pushed as high as 16,947 on Friday, within striking distance of 17,000 points.  While it hasn't made as many of the large jumps that other stock indexes have made in recent months, Canada's benchmark stock index has quietly put together a solid rally by stacking small gains on top of each other. It is up 18 per cent since the beginning of the year.  The TSX has gained in eight of the last nine trading sessions, based on strength in the two sectors that tend to drive its fortunes: banks and oil companies.  Together, those two sectors make up almost 50 per cent of the index, and both have been steadily marching higher for a while now.    Strong run for energy  Energy companies in particular have had a strong week after attacks on Saudi oil facilities by drones believed to have been controlled by Iranian forces prompted fears of war in the Middle East, which would lead to lower oil supplies and drive up the price of Canada's crude.  The TSX inched up despite data from Statistics Canada released Friday showing relatively weak retail sales that grew by just 0.4 per cent in August, less than expected. Ordinarily, a sign that consumers aren't opening their wallets would nudge the stock market lower, but underlying strength elsewhere is seemingly enough to offset that sentiment.  ""Any disappointment from the retail sales number that may appear in the market today could be offset by improving sentiment toward energy stocks as energy commodity prices continue to climb,"" said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at SIA Wealth Management in Toronto.  Stocks veered lower on Wall Street in afternoon trading Friday after reports that a Chinese delegation has cut short a visit to the United States fuelled speculation that upcoming talks aimed at resolving the costly trade war between Washington and Beijing are in trouble.  Contradictory signals from U.S. President Donald Trump have Chinese negotiators on edge, and traders say the uncertainty means bad news for American companies.  The Dow Industrial Average fell 160 points to 26,935.    The U.S. oil benchmark WTI was above $58 US a barrel on Friday, compared to $54.92 a week earlier. That's down from $62 earlier in the week after news of the Saudi oil attack broke, but still the highest price for benchmark contract since May.

Conservative candidate Justina McCaffrey, whose sign was pictured beside the homemade one, agreed that ""threats of political violence have no place in our democracy.""

140,"I love you, Newfoundland, but I can no longer be your kitchen party poster boy","For years, I provided the soundtrack to a million brain-numbing buzzes.  For two decades, I was gainfully employed as one of Newfoundland and Labrador's most popular exports: the excellent folk pop party boy band Great Big Sea.  That success came at a cost, though. It's a story that involves addiction — and overcoming sexual abuse.  I'm now 52, and I'm stronger than I've ever been, but I have to wonder how I now fit in with the ""Newfoundland brand"" I once worked so hard to sell.    First, let me tell you about where I came from.  I was born in Carbonear and my people come from Gull Island and Northern Bay.   When I was two years old, my dad got a job in the ""city state"" of St. John's so I was raised a townie but we always kept our hearts close to where we came from.  My grandfather Jeremiah McCann taught me how to clean a fish, cut and haul wood, and handle a dory, essential skills for any self-respecting bayman to possess. He had spent the vast majority of his 98 years on this earth labouring as a fisherman, carpenter, coal miner, and swiler to spare his 16 children from starvation.    He was a gentle and quiet man with hard-working hands swollen as big as his head and even in his old age local ""hangashores"" were careful to keep their distance. Whenever I introduced him to my friends from town, instead of asking where they were from, he would pose the far deeper question, ""Where do you belong?""  Selling the 'kitchen party' brand  Great Big Sea was born out of the collapse of the cod fishery in 1992 and the subsequent lack of employment opportunities at home, our big little local band decided to give the music business a go.  Somehow, through shared determination and some very good luck, we managed to build a lucrative career singing traditional Newfoundland folk songs and selling the ""kitchen party"" brand.    We sold almost two million CDs (remember those?) and hoisted at least double that many ""sociables"" at thousands of soldout shows all over North America, all the while extolling the many virtues of Newfoundland and Labrador and inviting everyone to visit.  A great many did, and for a time we were hailed as the province's brightest ambassadors and even bore the tourism campaign logos on our tour bus.  In truth, this was no heavy burden because we were all genuinely proud of where we came from and eager to help promote the fledgling tourism industry as an economic offset to the devastating loss of our fishery.  We sang our hearts out every night preaching the Newfoundland gospel and for 20 years we were arguably the best Saturday night Canada ever had.   The dark side of Saturday night  Unfortunately for me, every night was Saturday night.   I am an addict and for 30 years I used alcohol and drugs to help me forget a painful past.  I was sexually abused by my priest as a teenager and I carried that secret around inside until it almost killed me.  It wasn't until I sobered up and faced my truth in 2011 that I was finally able to move forward and slowly recover.  Séan McCann wrote the song One Good Reason based on the conversation he had with his wife Andrea in November 2011, when he realized he needed to stay sober:     My sobriety was hard won and came with some serious side effects.  St. John's is the Canadian equivalent of the legendary New Orleans of Louisiana and its reputation as a hard partying town has been well earned and definitely deserved.  I certainly did my bit bragging about the benefits of its prolific pub scene and spent most of my nights home bar-hopping with my drinking buddies.  When I finally put the bottle down these ""friends"" were nowhere to be found. My phone stopped ringing and I was left alone.    A lust for liquor was apparently the only real thing we had in common, and as an alcoholic living in St. John's I found it very difficult to make new friends who were willing to support my alcohol-free lifestyle.  This isolation, I have learned, is a common side effect of sobriety encountered by thousands of addicts before me.  Life at work was no less lonely, and although I managed to remain sober on the great big bus for our 20th anniversary tour in 2013 (an achievement for which I shall remain forever proud), the tension it caused would ultimately prove too much to bear.  For the sake of my family and my own recovery, I walked away from my extremely well-paying job and the only home I ever knew and, at the age of 48, relocated to Ottawa to start all over again.  I have no regrets.  The hardest decision  Aside from actually getting clean, leaving Newfoundland was the hardest thing I've ever had to do.  Four years later I am still sober and I still have my family … and my life. Change is never easy but often necessary for survival. This is especially true for an alcoholic in recovery and I am grateful for all the new friends I have made along the way.  Through it all, music has remained my constant and faithful companion and I still earn my living doing what I love to do most; singing and sharing my truth with others so they too might learn how to help themselves.  Today I sing a different kind of song.    It's not about partying in the kitchen and drinking your troubles away, but about doing the hard work of actually facing your problems and trying to overcome them.  A secret can kill you but a song can save your life, and I intend to make sure every single song I have left in me is sung with that purpose in mind.  It's been fully 25 years since I last toured rural Newfoundland. When I was invited to speak at this year's Provincial Student Leadership Conference, I saw an opportunity to share my experience with local teenagers in the hopes of sparing them from the life of addiction I endured and was lucky to survive.  I've travelled this country as a keynote speaker for the past four years, sharing my story and singing my heart out for tens of thousands of addicts, survivors, and frontline workers who have, in turn, shared their own stories with me.  It is a powerful connection and one I never take for granted. I have learned that people drink and use drugs for reasons and my own addiction began as a direct result of the trauma I suffered from sexual abuse as a teenager growing up in Newfoundland.  I know exactly how it feels to be young and in trouble, alone and afraid, and I hope my experience will help today's youth cope with the problems they too will face.  I also know how incredibly easy it is to develop an alcohol dependency in my old hometown.  Immune from scrutiny  Drinking has become engrained in Newfoundland's cultural identity and enjoys a certain immunity from local scrutiny and concern.  But it is no less dangerous.    On Nov. 9, I will be eight years sober. Recovery has shown me my true voice and I have found the best version of myself singing and sharing my truth openly with people.  I was once very lost but now I know exactly where I ""belong.""  Today I sing a song of sobriety, survival, and sharing personal truth. I still wear my Newfoundland heart on my sleeve with pride everywhere I go but now my ""ranting and roaring"" is all about recovery.  I love you, Newfoundland, and I miss you very much but I can no longer be your kitchen party poster boy.  I hope we still have some songs left together to sing.  Séan McCann will be touring Newfoundland and Labrador in October, with appearances in Corner Brook, Placentia, Marystown, Clarenville, English Harbour and Twillingate.

141,"California's chronic water overuse leads to sinking towns, arsenic pollution","When you walk through Jeannie Williams's sunny orchard, you don't notice anything wrong. But the problem's there, underfoot. The land around her — about 250 square kilometres — is sinking.  ""It's frightening,"" Williams says. ""Is the land going to come back up? I don't know.""  She points out the well from which she obtains all of the water she needs to grow organic fruits and vegetables. The well is small and shallow; she only has two acres of crops to water. But her neighbours are far more thirsty, and have been for a very long time.  Her farm in Hanford is located in California's Central Valley, a 47,000 square kilometre area that produces about a quarter of America's food supply — and a large part of the $3.6 billion US worth of produce that California exports to Canada.  For more than a century farmers in the Central Valley have been pumping water out of the ground — so much so that the land is slowly sinking, a process known as subsidence. In less than 100 years, it's dropped 8½ metres.  ""Some areas actually are sinking one to two feet [30-60 centimetres] a year,"" says recently retired NASA geologist Tom Farr. ""That's a huge amount.""    For years, researchers like Farr have used satellites to measure exactly how far and how fast the ground is sinking. A recent graphic of the southern Central Valley produced by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography shows a dark purple area indicating the most serious area of subsidence.  ""It's relatively confined to that area around Corcoran, and it's about 30 or 40 miles [50 to 65 km] across, so it's not small,"" Farr says.    Corcoran, only 30 kilometres south of Williams's farm in Hanford, bills itself as the ""Farming Capital of California."" No surprise that it's also the state's subsidence capital. But it's far from alone. The latest survey by the California Department of Water Resources found almost 40 sites with significant levels of subsidence.  ""We're just pumping too much groundwater, especially in the agricultural areas in the Central Valley,"" Farr says.  A Stanford University study published in the journal Water Resources Research found that unless action is taken, the ground in that region will sink more than four metres over the next 20 years.  And the region is already feeling the effects.    In a tiny white shed next to a vineyard in Terra Bella, Calif., groundwater hydrologist Michelle Sneed unspools a cable that will snake more than 300 metres down into the earth.  ""As the land subsides, more of this pipe will appear to protrude from the casing,"" Sneed says. She checks some gauges and taps a few notes into her laptop. This was a wet year, Sneed says, and still the ground sank more than 2.5 centimetres.  ""It is quite a bit when you're talking about the impact to canals,"" Sneed says.  She's talking about canals like the one just metres up an embankment from the shed: the Friant-Kern Canal. It's a 250-kilometre-long aqueduct that delivers water to 15,000 farms.    ""This canal really is critical for water delivery,"" Sneed says, walking along its bank.  But the system depends on gravity, and now the ground has sunk so much in some spots the water has to travel uphill, turning the canal in some places into essentially a deep pool.  ""And so that impacts the ability of the canal to actually move water,"" Sneed says.  ""It can only transmit about 40 per cent of the water that it was designed to transmit. And there are other things too: roads, railways, pipelines, any sort of long infrastructure that crosses these areas of what we call differential subsidence are impacted.""  Subsidence also reduces the ability of the earth itself — composed largely of clay — to store water.  ""Those randomly oriented clay grains will start to realign themselves into a stack,"" Sneed says, which takes up less space, leading to the land sinking. ""But also now there's less space to store water.""    A 2019 study by researchers at Arizona State University found that the aquifer system in the San Joaquin Valley at the heart of the Central Valley lost up to three per cent of its storage capacity from 2012 to 2015.  And once that capacity is lost, Sneed says, it's lost for good.  ""You can't undo it. Even if everybody stopped pumping today and we just let the groundwater aquifer systems just recharge, you don't get that subsidence back.""  According to the Arizona State researchers, if California experiences only one drought per decade, the state's aquifers could permanently lose more than a quarter of their storage capacity this century.  And the problems caused by subsidence don't end there.    In the tiny community of Allensworth, about 60 kilometres south of Williams's Hanford farm, no one dares drink from the tap.  Allensworth resident Israel Sanchez walks out of his home tapping a large refillable water bottle, the kind one might see topping an office water cooler. Sanchez says he spends about $200 a month on bottled water.  ""This is what we have to go buying all the time in the town,"" Sanchez says. ""That's how we survive here.""  That's because the water is dangerously polluted with arsenic. Subsidence is kind of like squeezing a sponge: the sinking ground presses contaminants like arsenic out of the soil and into the groundwater.  A recent Stanford study in the journal Nature Communications found that in areas where land sank more than 7.6 cm per year, the risk of finding dangerous levels of arsenic in groundwater tripled.  That study also found that around 10 per cent of wells tested in this agricultural hotspot showed dangerous levels of arsenic.    And just across from Sanchez's house, a cautionary tale: historic Allensworth.  Driving around the small community composed of several homes, a schoolhouse, a church, and a few other simple structures, one might easily get the idea that you were visiting a ghost town.  ""It's never been a ghost town,"" insists Jerelyn Oliveira, an interpreter at the Colonel Allensworth State Historic Park. ""There has actually been a continually operating elementary school here since 1910.""  Oliveira uses her key to open the door of a white house. Inside are pictures of several African-American women: Colonel Allen Allensworth's daughters. This was his house, at the centre of the town he founded. In the early 1900s it was a thriving African-American community. By the 1960s it became an empty tourist attraction.  One of the reasons this town was eventually abandoned, according to Oliveira: arsenic.    She points to a row of trees several hundred metres away.  ""It's hard to believe that's an old lake bed,"" Oliveira says.  Now, even less remains of the lake than of historic Allensworth. So much water was diverted for agricultural use, the lake vanished. And a new problem emerged.  ""Arsenic is something that was already in the land as it's a natural occurring mineral,"" Oliveira says. But with more farmers using the water and the water table not being replenished, she says, ""the concentrations [of arsenic] were going to get higher. And that's what eventually happened…. The community faded. Its wells were deemed unsafe.""    Historic Allensworth provides a dramatic lesson, but it's one California has been slow to learn. It was the last state in the U.S. to adopt a groundwater law. The Sustainable Groundwater Management Act of 2014 requires aquifers to become sustainable, but only by 2040.  With the added threat of more frequent droughts due to climate change, experts like Farr say more needs to be done to recharge the aquifers and curb water use right now, or the ground will keep sinking and the aquifers will keep shrinking.  ""The farmers now are coming to terms with that, and that they may have to pump less,"" Farr says.    But many farmers like Williams say that's not likely unless the state of California builds more reservoirs.  Until then, she says, ""farmers have no choice but to pump it out of the ground. Either that or we don't grow crops, and people need to eat.""  On the land next to hers, you can hear the roar of a huge machine: a giant hydraulic drilling rig. It turns out her neighbour is digging a new well for his farm. It's big. And it's deep.",technology
142,Scotiabank says no risk to customers after bank's software found on coding website,"A Canadian IT consultant is raising the alarm after he says he found some sensitive software code belonging to Scotiabank on a popular online file-sharing repository.  Jason Coulls says he found source codes and access keys for some of the bank's internal systems while searching on GitHub, a popular online tool for software programmers that allows them to share information and collaborate on projects.  The discovery was first reported by British technology website The Register and has since been picked up by various cybersecurity-related publications.  Coulls told CBC News on Friday that he made no attempt to access any of the bank's information once he uncovered the code, but he said it looked as if some of the code he found was used to analyze various payment processing systems.  ""In order to do that it has to access the customer transaction data,"" he said, which means some information such as customer names, account numbers and other identifying information could be accessed.  ""Basically the things they ask for to then do a scam,"" he said. ""That's not good to have that kind of information out there.""  Coulls says the bank has removed most of the files since he brought it to light, but nonetheless information that clearly should not have been public was available in plain sight for months to anyone who knew where to look.  Coulls says he has no idea if the information was used for nefarious purposes — or indeed if the data was old code that no longer would provide access to the bank's network — but he stresses that's it's a problem either way. To show why, he says what the bank has done is akin to leaving a key to a house hidden on a front porch.  ""When they leave the keys out, you can see the keys and you can see the lock, but nobody will know 100 per cent if the key actually works or not,"" or indeed if anyone entered the house, he said in an interview. ""Whether somebody did go in or not we would never know and whether the key would fit the lock also we would not know.""  In a statement to CBC News, the bank said its technical teams were ""working to remove the information"" from the web, but stressed that the data on the bank's 25 million customers is secure.  ""The information that was posted on an online data repository does not contain information that would put our customers, employees and partners at risk,"" the bank said.",technology
143,Singh vows NDP would double natural disaster support fund for communities,"NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh says his government would more than double the disaster mitigation funds provided to communities.   He made the announcement in Gatineau, Que., which has suffered severe flooding and tornadoes in the last few years.   Following a string of natural disasters across the country, the Liberals committed $2 billion over 10 years to help communities. That money in the Disaster Mitigation and Adaptation Fund is used to match the funding of municipalities and provinces.   Under the Liberal plan, local governments must come up with half the cost and only infrastructure projects with a price tag of more than $20 million qualify.     Singh says the NDP would boost that funding to $4.5 billion over four years and lower the threshold to get projects approved, but still ask local governments to provide half the funding.   The money is to help communities respond to extreme weather events, Singh said. But it's also intended to help them get ahead of the damage caused by climate change by adapting their infrastructure to, for example, withstand or divert floods, he said.  ""What we've seen for too long is there's a disaster, and then there's a response,"" he told reporters.   ""And instead of responding after the case, what we're proposing is if we give investments to municipalities right now, they can put in place the infrastructure to avoid this from happening.""    Singh said the NDP is also prepared to work with the provinces and municipalities to address the fears and concerns of homeowners on floodplains.   That initiative would fall under the NDP's wider environmental plan, which would commit $15 billion to lower emissions and protect the environment.",politics
144,How the country's new pipeline dispute could shake up oil business,"Think ""pipeline dispute"" and the mind may conjure up images of environmental protest, pro-oil rallies and bickering politicians.  But there's another kind of dispute simmering over pipelines these days — one that could shake-up the sector for years to come and is dividing opinions in the Canadian oilpatch.   It may also offer an early test of the new Canada Energy Regulator (CER), which replaced the National Energy Board only a few weeks ago.    ""This could be a market-altering event,"" said Jackie Forrest, senior director at the ARC Energy Research Institute.  ""We have to tread very carefully in terms of understanding what the implications of this massive change will be for the industry and the markets.""  At issue is a proposal by Calgary-based Enbridge to revamp its Mainline system, changing how it assigns space on the pipeline network responsible for most of Canada's oil transportation.    For decades, the Mainline has operated as a 100 per cent common carrier.   ""Every month, anyone that wants to ship on the line can say that they want to ship and how much they want to ship and that space gets divvied up,"" Forest said. ""It's open for everyone.""  Enbridge's new proposal is to reduce the common-carrier portion of the Mainline to 10 per cent, while 90 per cent would be designated for companies signed up for longer contracts of up to 20 years.  The company says it's responding to what it's heard from its many stakeholders, including shippers, producers, refiners and marketers in both Canada and the United States.    ""They want to be able access the same services from Enbridge that are currently available on competing pipelines,"" said Guy Jarvis, the company's executive vice president of liquids pipelines.  ""Priority access, toll certainty and the potential to contract for terms of up to 20 years.""  It's not a plan that sits well with everyone, though.  In August, Enbridge announced a two-month ""open season,"" a period when it will accept bids from shippers who want to sign longer-term contracts for priority transport on the Mainline.    This spurred several companies to stake out their opposition, including Suncor, Shell Canada and MEG Energy, as well as the Explorers and Producers Association of Canada (EPAC).  Suncor, the country's largest oil and gas producer by market capitalization, wants the Canada Energy Regulator (CER) to put the brakes on the open-season process.  In its submission to the federal regulator, Suncor says the open season effectively compels shippers to bid for contracted space even if they consider the terms and conditions of service and tolls to be ""unclear, uncertain, inappropriate, unfair or unjust and unreasonable.""    It asks the regulator to declare that Enbridge cannot offer contract carriage, or require binding contracts be signed, until the terms and conditions of the new system, including tolls, receive regulatory approval.  EPAC, whose members represent about 20 per cent of Canadian oil and gas production, is concerned about the timing of the Enbridge proposal when some producers are already facing struggles getting oil to market.  ""There is a severe shortage of pipeline capacity, a high level of apportionment, and no certainty as to future capacity additions,"" association president Tristan Goodman wrote in a submission to the CER.  ""There are no other alternatives for the captured shippers. This puts our members in an untenable position of having to contract for firm service for fear of being blocked out of capacity, and not because it is in their best interest to do so.""  Still, there are other businesses that support a revamp, including oilsands giant Cenovus Energy.    Cenovus told the regulator it believes the changes will provide certainty for shippers moving volumes of oil to downstream markets, which includes refineries.  It also agrees with Enbridge that the regulator should not interrupt the established open-season process, used to gauge whether there is shipper interest in the service.  ""The harm that will arise from upending the established practice will be yet another indication to companies and investors that the regulatory process in Canada is uncertain and may be adjusted on an ad hoc basis,"" Cenovus wrote.    Enbridge fired back in its own submissions it would be ""unjust and unreasonable"" to be required to obtain regulatory approval of its proposed Mainline changes before it had the chance to gauge shipper interest in the service.  No other pipeline in Canada has been required to follow such a process, Enbridge says.  Opponents of the Enbridge proposal hope the CER will make the decision to pause the project in the coming days. But first the regulator's six-member commission may have to decide whether it has the jurisdiction to take such action.  With the open season set to end on Oct. 2, the clock is ticking. It's a decision the industry will be watching closely.",business
145,Federal candidates make pitches to B.C. First Nations at AFN meeting,"Several federal election candidates delivered their pitches to B.C. First Nations leadership at a meeting in Musqueam on Thursday, speaking about their commitments to issues like climate change, Indigenous rights and title and the implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.  Elected leadership and delegates from 58 First Nations at the B.C. Assembly of First Nations' annual general assembly listened to what they can expect from the Green, Liberal and New Democratic parties if elected. A Conservative Party candidate was invited to speak but couldn't attend, according to organizers.  Among the seven candidates who spoke, five were First Nations from communities across the province.     Despite running for different political parties, the speakers' tone was cordial. Two of the seven candidates who spoke are running against each other in the same riding.   ""I'm honoured to sit with some really stellar individuals in spite of the fact we might not share the same worldview,"" said Joan Phillip, New Democratic Party candidate for the Central Okanagan-Similkameen-Nicola riding.  ""I hold you up. I thank you for taking this bold step in wanting to represent us.""  Independent candidates Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott were also in attendance and spoke about what they'll bring to Ottawa if re-elected and where they see First Nations advocacy being crucial in the years to come in areas like on-reserve infrastructure funding and child welfare legislation.     Climate change dominated discussions   Candidates were given five minutes each to talk at the session. A great deal of emphasis was placed on climate change and how addressing its impacts require co-operation and collaboration, and that Indigenous people have a fundamental role to play.   Lydia Hwitsum, running as the Green Party candidate for Cowichan-Malahat-Langford, said ""As Indigenous people close to the land, close to our territories, we feel it first. We see and feel the impact of climate change in terms of our access to our foods and plants and natural world that has sustained us.""    Teegee commended the candidates for speaking at length about climate change, which he said is ""quite frankly the biggest issue,"" not only for North America but the world.  He said he was also encouraged in the commitments he heard about implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.   Candidates asked about Trudeau brownface photos  After each candidate spoke, those in the room were invited to ask questions. The first question redirected the conversation in the room to the photos of Liberal leader Justin Trudeau in brownface that were published in the last 24 hours.     One by one, each of the candidates spoke of their disappointment in Trudeau and many spoke about their own personal experiences with racism.   ""We can't wash the colour of our skin off; this is who we are,"" said Hwitsum.   Bob Chamberlin, NDP candidate for Nanaimo-Ladysmith, said the photos were a reminder that ""racism is alive and well in Canada.""  Phillip said she felt Trudeau's apology rang hollow to her and that ""if he had any integrity whatsoever he would step down.""  Green Party leader Elizabeth May, running for re-election in Saanich-Gulf Islands, said ""I felt physically ill.""    Michelle Corfield, Liberal candidate in the Nanaimo-Ladysmith riding, was the last to respond to the question and started by saying she, too, was disappointed.   ""And then I heard it was 20 years ago,"" she said.  She reflected on who she was, where she was and what she was doing 20 years ago and talked about how her grandmother taught her that people make mistakes and need to be forgiven when they ask for it.   ""What I say today is I hope the country learns a lesson from this and that they take away something that is going to change people… That is my hope because he has asked for forgiveness, he has said sorry. It is now time for us as a country to look at that and take something from it.""  The annual general assembly runs until Friday.",politics
146,CannTrust says Health Canada has suspended its cannabis licence,"CannTrust Holdings Inc. says it received a notice of licence suspension from Health Canada, which has been investigating the cannabis company for allegedly cultivating pot in unlicensed rooms.  The Vaughan, Ont.-based company says the notice it received from the regulator on Tuesday indicates that Health Canada has suspended its authority to produce cannabis — other than cultivating and harvesting — and to sell cannabis.  The company says it is facing a partial suspension of its licences for standard cultivation and a full suspension of its licences for standard processing, medical sales, cannabis drugs and research.  However, CannTrust will be permitted to cultivate and harvest existing lots or batches that were previously grown and conduct ancillary activities in connection with them. But it cannot propagate new lots or batches or sell or distribute cannabis.  CannTrust had previously halted all sales and shipments of cannabis as Health Canada continued its probe, and both the company and the regulator have put on hold a total of 12,700 kilograms of cannabis products.  The notice states that Health Canada will reinstate CannTrust's licences under section 64(4) of the Cannabis Act if the company demonstrates that the suspension was unfounded or if the reasons for the suspension no longer exist.  It also states that CannTrust could address the public health and safety risks by:     Ensuring its cannabis is produced and distributed only as licensed, including measures to control the movement of cannabis in and out of CannTrust's site.   Recovering cannabis that was not authorized by CannTrust's licence.   Improving key personnel's knowledge of and compliance with the provisions of the Cannabis Act and other regulations that apply to the company.   Improving record keeping and inventory tracking.",health
147,"Any province could veto a major pipeline under an NDP government, says Singh","An NDP government would grant all provinces veto power over national infrastructure projects that cross their borders, says NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh.  The declaration came after Singh unveiled his party's Quebec platform, which would grant that province veto power over infrastructure projects on its territory, including pipelines.  ""I would not impose a project on any province and that means there has to be social acceptability,"" said Singh in an interview with host Vassy Kapelos on CBC News Network's Power &amp; Politics, set to air Monday night.  ""I mean, it should be the fact if we want to move forward with a project, there has to be the buy-in from all the people involved.""    The NDP's Quebec platform states that projects ""cannot bypass Quebec's environmental laws and cannot proceed without the agreement of the Government and people of Quebec.""  Quebec Premier Francois Legault has said he is opposed to any cross-Canada oil pipeline project that would be built through Quebec, arguing there is ""no social acceptability"" for an additional pipeline through the province.    Singh told Power &amp; Politics that if a government led by him failed to build consensus among provinces affected by a project, the project wouldn't proceed.  When asked if that policy would diminish the federal government's power to designate certain projects as serving the national interest, Singh said that the ""national interest has to coincide with making the efforts to have people that are impacted believe in the project.""    ""But that's kind of the beauty of federalism, that it's not something that should be where we're imposing decisions, where we work and provide an advantage, provide investments, show people that this is going to be to their benefit and, if that can be done, then it should be a project that goes ahead,"" added Singh.  The federal government has the constitutional authority to impose national infrastructure projects on provinces, including pipelines.    Interpreting Section 35 of the Constitution, the Supreme Court of Canada has ruled that while the federal government has a duty to consult affected Indigenous communities about infrastructure projects, that duty does not amount to a veto power for Indigenous peoples.

148,"U.S. abortion rate at lowest level since Roe v. Wade ruling, according to report","The number and rate of abortions across the United States have plunged to their lowest levels since the procedure became legal across the country in 1973, according to new figures released Wednesday.  The report from the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that says it works to advance sexual and reproductive health and rights, counted 862,000 of the procedures in the U.S. in 2017. That's down from 926,000 tallied in the group's 2014 report and from just over one million in 2011.  Guttmacher, a non-profit, is the only entity that strives to count all abortions in the U.S., making inquiries of individual providers. Federal data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention excludes California, Maryland and New Hampshire.  The new report illustrates that abortions are decreasing in all parts of the country, whether in Republican-controlled states seeking to restrict abortion access or in Democratic-run states protecting abortion rights. Between 2011 and 2017, abortion rates increased in only five states and the District of Columbia.  One reason for the drop in the number of abortions is the declining birth rate. The Guttmacher Institute noted the birth rate, as well as the abortion rate, dropped during the years covered by the new report. A likely factor, the report said, is increased accessibility of contraception since 2011, as the Affordable Care Act required most private health insurance plans to cover contraceptives without out-of-pocket costs.  Abortion pill increased since last report  According to the report, the 2017 abortion rate was 13.5 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-44 — the lowest rate since the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion. Following that ruling, the number in the U.S. rose steadily — peaking at 1.6 million in 1990 before starting a steady, still-continuing decline. The abortion rate is now less than half what is was in 1990.  Guttmacher noted that almost 400 state laws restricting abortion access were enacted between 2011 and 2017, but said these laws were not the main force behind the overall decline in abortions. It said 57 per cent of the nationwide decline occurred in the 18 states, plus the District of Columbia, that did not enact any new restrictions.    Between 2011 and 2017, the number of clinics providing abortion in the U.S. declined from 839 to 808, with significant regional disparities, the report said. The South had a decline of 50 clinics, including 25 in Texas, and the Midwest had a decline of 33 clinics, including nine each in Iowa, Michigan and Ohio. By contrast, the Northeast added 59 clinics, mostly in New Jersey and New York.  Over that period, the abortion rate dropped in Ohio by 27 per cent and in Texas by 30 per cent, but the rate dropped by similar amounts in states that protected abortion access, including California, Hawaii and New Hampshire.  Areas with the highest abortion rates in 2017 were the District of Columbia, New Jersey, New York, Maryland and Florida. Rates were lowest in Wyoming, South Dakota, Kentucky, Idaho and Missouri — many women from those five states go out of state to obtain abortions.  One significant trend documented in the report: those undergoing abortions are increasingly relying on medication rather than surgery. Medication abortion, making use of the so-called abortion pill, accounted for 39 per cent of all abortions in 2017, up from 29 per cent in 2014.  Impact of most recent laws not yet clear  The report, which focuses on data from 2017, does not chronicle the flurry of sweeping abortion bans enacted earlier this year in several Republican-controlled states, including a near-total ban in Alabama and five bills that would ban abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected, as early as six weeks into pregnancy. None of those bans has taken effect; their backers hope that litigation over the laws might eventually lead to a Supreme Court ruling weakening or overturning Roe v. Wade.  Guttmacher's president, Dr. Herminia Palacio, said abortion restrictions, regardless of whether they lead to fewer abortions, ""are coercive and cruel by design,"" with a disproportionate impact on low-income women.  However, the push for tougher restrictions continues. Just last week, Texas Right to Life and some allied groups urged Gov. Greg Abbott to call a special session of the legislature to ""abolish every remaining elective abortion"" in the state.  The report comes amid upheaval in the federal family planning program, known as Title X. About one in five family planning clinics has left the program, objecting to a Trump administration regulation that bars them from referring women for abortions. Title X clinics provide birth control and basic health services for low-income women.  ""If your priority is to reduce abortions, one of the best things you can do is make sure that women have access to high-quality, affordable and effective methods of birth control,"" said Alina Salganicoff, director of women's health policy for the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.",health
149,B.C. says it hasn't 'consented' to $900M military sexual assault settlement,"British Columbia wants a say in the federal government's proposed $900 million class action lawsuit settlement with hundreds of current and former members of the Canadian military who allege they were the victims of rampant sexual misconduct.  The province's attorney general has written to the Federal Court asking for standing in the case as a judge this week hears submissions for and against the proposed settlement.  The federal government has approached all of the provinces asking them for a waiver abandoning any claim for federal compensation for the cost of providing health care to the alleged victims.  ""The province has not agreed to waive its claim and has not consented to the proposed settlement,"" said the letter from the office of B.C. Attorney General David Eby, dated Sept. 13.  The judge plans a separate hearing to deal with Eby's request for standing and other logistical matters related to the proposed settlement.    Eby's letter, filed with the court this week, suggested that both Ontario and Nova Scotia harbour similar reservations about being unable to recover from the federal government health care costs related to the alleged misconduct of soldiers, sailors and aircrew.  Lawyers representing the hundreds of alleged victims would not comment on the letter or its potential impact on the case, saying they'll wait to see what arguments the province makes before Justice Simon Fothergill.  The settlement was announced last summer, with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau holding it up as a sign that the Liberal government takes seriously claims of sexual misconduct in the military. The federal government does not admit liability in the case.  Out of the $900 million set aside by Ottawa for the settlement, $800 million will go toward paying the claims of current and former members of the Canadian Armed Forces. An additional $100 million will be used to settle with civilian employees of the Department of National Defence who say they experienced sexual harassment, sexual assault or discrimination based on sex, gender, gender identity or sexual orientation on the job.  Members of the class action will be eligible for individual compensation sums of between $5,000 and $55,000, depending on the circumstances of their cases.  Those who experienced ""exceptional harm"" and were previously denied benefits could be eligible for up to $155,000 each.    In a statement issued when the settlement was announced, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan said ""no one should feel unsafe at work"" and ""it takes a lot of courage to come forward and share difficult and painful experiences and press for change.""  Over the past two days, the judge has heard harrowing personal accounts from the alleged victims, who are both male and female.  'I'm broken'  Some of the harassment cases and alleged crimes date back decades, but many are more recent. Some allegedly happened over the last few years.  ""I'm broken,"" one former female officer told court today. She said her assault was reported to the military police and the subsequent investigation interviewed only friends of the accused. (CBC News does not report the names of alleged sexual assault victims.)  Another woman, a member of the air force, spoke about being drugged in an officer's mess and raped in a barracks in 2010. On that night, she told the judge, a predator stole her sense of security from her.  ""To this day, I don't know who did it. Charges were never laid. There was no hearing and no verdict,"" said the woman, who is no longer in the military.  ""When news of the class action lawsuit reached me, I initially felt as if this could be my chance at attaining a small measure of justice.""    She said the settlement, which she favours, represents validation for what she and others endured.  ""It is impossible to erase the damage caused by the trauma and the systemic betrayal of trust, but if this settlement can begin to lift those wounded soldiers up, then it has my full support,"" she said.  Others told the judge that more needs to be done within the military to screen out sexual predators.  During the last four years, the Canadian military has waged a high-profile campaign to stamp out sexual misconduct and assault within the ranks.  Some of the alleged victims who spoke on Friday are still serving members; they told the judge that the policy has had limited success and the military's macho culture is deeply ingrained.",politics
150,Former Liberal adviser rips party over racial insensitivity in government ranks,"A former adviser in the Liberal government said he wasn't surprised by photos of Justin Trudeau in blackface makeup because he encountered racially insensitive behaviour while working in the upper ranks of his government.  Omer Aziz said the photos of Trudeau are of a piece with behaviour he saw while working on Parliament Hill with Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland's policy team. According to his Linked In profile, Aziz held the job for seven months. He quit in 2018.  ""Sometimes a slip of the tongue is not just a slip of the tongue. It's a slip of the mask,"" he said in an interview with CBC Radio's The House airing today.  ""I basically had to leave my dream job because of racist prejudices that went unacknowledged.""  Aziz said that while he worked in the department, he heard staffers referring to certain communities as ""ethnic vote banks."" He said he was assigned to ""brown files"" in the department — files dealing with non-white-majority countries — and said he was subjected to ""whitesplaining"" by colleagues who assumed he wasn't aware of certain cultural nuances because of his skin colour.    Trudeau has been forced to answer uncomfortable questions all week after three instances of him wearing brownface or blackface as part of various costumes surfaced in the media.  The images span about a decade and a variety of situations, and show Trudeau in blackface both as a teenager and as an adult.  ""What I did was inexcusable and wrong and hurt a lot of people who considered me to be an ally and that was wrong. And I am deeply, deeply sorry,"" Trudeau told a crowd in Saskatchewan Thursday.  Trudeau has now publicly apologized twice — but he also has repeatedly declined to state how many times he may have worn blackface. He said he was ""wary of being definitive about this because of the recent pictures that came out, I had not remembered.""  Aziz said almost all of his colleagues in the federal government were white and seemed unaware of subtle racist behaviour in the workplace.  ""People in power above me were blind to what I was seeing,"" he said.  ""I felt like (...) I was a character from the movie Get Out, where my reality was kind of warped and distorted. Obviously people are never racist to your face.""    CBC News's requests for comment from the Prime Minister's Office and Freeland's office were forwarded to the Liberal Party.  ""When hiring exempt staff across government, the aim is always to identify high-quality candidates that reflect the diversity of Canada and to build more inclusive work environments,"" the party statement reads.  Aziz said he tried to share his concerns with Gerry Butts, then the principal secretary to the prime minister, but was ultimately unable to meet with him.  The India trip  Aziz said his decision to leave the Liberal government permitted him to dodge a bullet: he believes he would have been involved in organizing Trudeau's early 2018 trip to India.  The trip turned into a colossal PR disaster for the prime minister after news emerged that a Sikh extremist had been invited to a reception at the Canadian High Commissioner's residence — and after he was roundly mocked for appearing in traditional Indian dress.  ""The India trip was brownface without the makeup,"" Aziz said.  As for the blackface images, Aziz wondered aloud how everyone managed ""to miss this for 18 years.""    Aziz said voters can still count on the Liberals to be progressive in areas like climate change and the economy — but they shouldn't assume Trudeau ""at every instance has been on the side of minorities and the powerless.""  ""Don't have any illusions and still pretend that this is a saviour ... It's not true,"" he said.  Trudeau also responded to questions about how voters should analyze his actions.  ""I certainly hope that they will continue to support us in the work that we're doing, but they might not,"" he said at a media event in Winnipeg Thursday. ""And I know that is something that all Canadians get to decide and they get to bring in all sorts of different factors, because every Canadian has a different way of looking at what matters to them.""  If the Liberals form government again, Aziz said he wants to see changes made at the top.  ""One thing I'm going to be looking forward to is if they are re-elected, do they diversify at the top, because I'm kind of tired of hearing about people talking about diversity when everyone around them looks the same.""",politics
151,All GM's vehicle assembly workers in Oshawa laid off because of U.S. strike,"The strike by 49,000 United Auto Workers (UAW) against General Motors in the United States has led to more temporary job losses at GM's assembly plant in Oshawa, Ont.  On Friday, GM issued a statement saying vehicle production at Oshawa has stopped, though there are stamping operations in that facility that continue.  The truck assembly line in Oshawa sent home 1,200 workers on Wednesday, as the line ran out of parts.  On Friday, the line that makes Chevrolet Impalas and Cadillacs was halted, leaving about 2,000 workers in total on temporary layoff. Only 75 employees, in the stamping operations, remain on the job at the Oshawa facility.  ""We plan to resume these operations as quickly as possible upon resolution of the UAW strike,"" GM spokesperson Jennifer Wright said in a statement.    Workers will be paid during the temporary layoffs, according to Unifor, the union for the Canadian workers. GM has scheduled the Oshawa line to close at the end of the year.  North American auto assembly is highly integrated, with plants in Canada reliant on parts coming from the U.S. and Mexico. The UAW strike has stopped production at more than 50 GM plants and warehouses in the U.S.  GM Canada also makes engines in St. Catharines, Ont., as well as the Chevrolet Equinox SUV in Ingersoll, Ont.   More layoffs could come  Jerry Dias, president of Unifor, said workers in St. Catharines could face layoffs soon, since about 80 per cent of the engines the plant builds are destined for cars assembled in the U.S. About 700 workers in St. Catharines, or two-thirds of the workforce, could be affected as soon as Monday.  At the Ingersoll CAMI assembly plant, about half the engines they put in cars come from the U.S. That plant is expected to run all next week, but may face shutdowns after that, unless the strike is settled.  In addition, at least 1,700 workers are affected at auto parts makers in Ontario that supply GM.  ""We have about 1,700 members working directly with suppliers that are affected as of right now,"" said Colin James, president of Unifor Local 222, which represents the Oshawa workers.  ""It's tough on those members, and they're looking to get back to work as soon as possible, but with the U.S. strike, nobody knows how long they'll be out,"" said James.  On Thursday, UAW vice-president Terry Dittes said progress was being made in the GM talks, though many issues remain unresolved.   Meanwhile, details are becoming clearer on GM's offer to invest $7 billion US in U.S. facilities, an offer made on the eve of the strike that began Monday.  The UAW is concerned with GM's plan to shut four U.S. plants and its lack of new investment in the U.S.  The new offer is to include $2 billion from joint ventures and suppliers for new plants that would pay workers less than the top union wage, a person briefed on the matter said.  Details emerge about GM offer  Those factories would not be run as typical GM plants. Although workers at those facilities would be represented by the UAW, they would be paid far less than the full UAW wage of about $30 per hour.  On Sunday, GM made part of the offer public, saying that its investment included 5,400 jobs, the majority of them new hires. But the person briefed on the talks said only about 2,700 new jobs will be added. The rest are jobs that would be retained because of the investments.  GM said it would invest in eight facilities in four states, introduce new electric trucks, make wage or lump sum payment increases and give each worker an $8,000 bonus once the deal is ratified.    CEO Mary Barra has predicted an ""all-electric future"" for GM, meaning jobs making gas-powered cars could be in jeopardy.  The person said union negotiators were disappointed after the company briefed them on details Wednesday. Further details were not available.",business
152,"In Quebec, Trudeau's opponents and supporters shrug off blackface controversy","Quebec had been the epicentre of debates about identity politics so far in the federal election campaign, with party leaders forced to confront to the popularity of a new law on religious symbols.  But the campaign shifted focus abruptly on Thursday, after photos and video emerged of Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau wearing racist makeup. The desire to talk identity politics in the province evaporated just as quickly.   Even though Trudeau's criticism of Quebec's secularism law has been controversial in the province, none of his usual opponents on the issue were itching to rake him over the coals.   ""I can understand that some people were hurt by these pictures. But Mr. Trudeau said that he was sorry. I think we have to talk about something else,"" said Premier François Legault, who has clashed with Trudeau over the law, also known as Bill 21.  The leader of the sovereignist Parti Québécois, Pascal Bérubé, went so far as to play down the condemnations issued by Trudeau's federal rivals.  ""It's a political campaign. They want to make sure that Mr. Trudeau pays for that,"" Bérubé told reporters in Quebec City. ""You can disagree with him on many issues, that's my case, but he's not a racist.""    Support holds steady in Trudeau's riding  Outside the bubble of professional politics, few voters indicated to CBCu002FRadio-Canada they would change their vote based on the images of Trudeau appearing in blackface.  In a predominantly Haitian neighborhood in north-end Montreal, which Trudeau has represented as an MP since 2008, his years-long involvement with the community appeared to have bought him a fair degree of goodwill.    CBC News and Radio-Canada reporters interviewed more than a dozen voters in the riding of Papineau on Thursday. All but one said they would still vote for Trudeau.  Seth Atoapoma, 28, said he was divided over whether to feel angry at the nearly 20 year-old photograph of the prime minister dressed in blackface. ""I am black, so the blackface issue is something I do care about. But then again it's 2019.""  Atoapoma, who works in a hair salon in the riding, added: ""I find him a good prime minister. I'm still voting for him. He does do a lot for us.""      In a statement issued Thursday afternoon, the Black Coalition of Quebec said Trudeau's government had proven itself an ally on several issues central to the black community.  ""Those who criticize Justin Trudeau are swimming in a pool of hypocrisy because they haven't done anything to promote black or cultural communities,"" the statement said.  Even outside Montreal, where Liberal support is weaker, few voters seemed inclined to vote against Trudeau because of the images.    In Saint-Hyacinthe, about 65 kilometres east of Montreal, none of the four locals interviewed by a CBC News reporter said the controversy would affect their ballot.   ""I don't think that is important. I think people should talk about something else,"" said Yves Brouillette, an undecided voter.   ""I think that happened 20 years ago. It was a mistake. But who doesn't make mistakes in life?""  Only passing interest in French newspapers  The French media in Quebec also shrugged off Wednesday night's revelations that Trudeau had dressed in blackface once in high school and again in 2001 while a teacher at a private school in British Columbia. A third image of him in blackface surfaced in video form Thursday.  Unlike in English Canada, few French newspapers gave prominent coverage to the images.  In Quebec City, Wednesday's Céline Dion concert was featured more prominently on the Thursday front pages of the local papers.    Le Nouvelliste, a tabloid that serves the electorally strategic district of Trois-Rivières, ran a story about the pictures on page 32.  The main political story on the front page of Montreal's Le Devoir was about Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer's proposal to build an oil pipeline through the province, and the possibility he could ignore Quebec's objections to such a project.  One Journal de Montreal columnist, Richard Martineau, did put the screws to Trudeau. But Martineau, who is often critical of multiculturalism and dismissive of minority groups, seemed mainly interested in accusing Trudeau of hypocrisy, not racism.    On the popular Montreal morning radio show Puisqu il faut se lever, host Paul Arcand and contributor Lise Ravary were more scandalized by the placement of Trudeau's right hand on a woman's chest in the 2001 picture from West Point Grey Academy showing the future prime minister wearing dark makeup as part of an Arabian Nights-themed costume.  ""Let's be clear, it's not far from her cleavage,"" Ravary said.",politics
153,Jeopardy host Alex Trebek resumes chemotherapy treatments,"Jeopardy host Alex Trebek says he has had a setback and is undergoing chemotherapy again for pancreatic cancer.  The Canadian-born game-show host said that after a short period of optimism when he stopped chemotherapy and began immunotherapy, his ""numbers shot up,"" he told ABC's Good Morning America on Tuesday    ""I was doing so well. And my numbers went down to the equivalent of a normal human being who does not have pancreatic cancer, so we were all very optimistic. And they said, 'Good, we're gonna stop chemo. We'll start you on immunotherapy,'"" he said.  ""I lost about 12 pounds in a week and my numbers went sky high, much higher than they were when I was first diagnosed. So, the doctors have decided that I have to undergo chemo again and that's what I'm doing.""  Doctors regularly monitor a cancer patient's blood cell counts to determine how his or her body is handling the particular treatment.   Trebek said his goals for the summer were to get his strength and hair back, and his progress on both fronts was ""dismal.""    The 79-year-old announced in March he had Stage 4 pancreatic cancer. He received an outpouring of support from fans, including from Canadians.  Despite the diagnosis, he hasn't missed a day on the show, which tapes its episodes in advance.      In late August, in a video teasing the forthcoming Jeopardy season, the show released a video in which the Sudbury, Ont.-born host declared: ""I'm on the mend and that's all I can hope for right now.""",entertainment
154,"Liberals promise to prohibit semi-automatic assault rifles, allow cities to ban handguns","Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau says a re-elected Liberal government would ban semi-automatic assault weapons and enable municipalities to restrict or prohibit handguns.  Trudeau made the announcement in Toronto's Greektown, the site of a deadly gun rampage last summer.  Faisal Hussain walked through the Danforth neighbourhood on July 22, 2018, shooting at people on the street, on patios and in restaurants.  He killed 10-year-old Julianna Kozis and 18-year-old Reese Fallon. Thirteen others were injured. Hussain, 29, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head after a gunfight with police.  ""People are dying. Families are grieving. Communities are suffering,"" Trudeau said, with 20 Liberal candidates standing behind him. ""So we're going to do more and we're going to do better. Thoughts and prayers are just not going to cut it. The choice could not be clearer: Liberals are for tougher gun laws, Conservatives are for weaker gun laws.""  Trudeau said a re-elected Liberal government would work with the provinces and territories to give municipalities the ability to further restrict – or ban – handguns.  Background materials from the Liberal Party said the semi-automatic assault rifle ban will include the AR-15, a weapon the party says is ""specifically designed to inflict mass human casualties and [has] no place in Canadian society.""  Fully automatic assault weapons are already banned in Canada.    A Liberal government also would create a buyback program for all semi-automatic assault rifles that were legally purchased, offering owners a fair market price for their weapons and giving law enforcement agencies resources to administer the program. A two-year amnesty would be put in place while the program is being set up.  Bill Blair, who served as the government's pointman on gun control, said there are about 250,000 of the weapons now legally owned, with an average value of about $1,500 each. The buyback program is expected to cost between $400 million and $600 million, he said.  Gun-maker Colt announced Thursday the company is suspending its production of rifles for the civilian market, including the popular AR-15. It said the shift is due to changes in consumer demand and a market already saturated with similar weapons.    No costing details were provided for the campaign promise; the party says that more information will be released ""over the course of the campaign.""  No costing provided  The federal Liberals are being accused by their rivals of keeping voters in the dark about the cost of their campaign promises. While the Conservatives and New Democrats have had their platforms costed by the Parliamentary Budget Office and publicly released, the Liberals have so far neglected to release PBO estimates for the nearly $4 billion worth of campaign promises they've made so far.  The Liberal gun control platform also promises to:     Prevent people suspected of posing a danger to themselves or others, including their partners or children, from possessing or acquiring new firearms.   Require that everyone importing ammunition show proof of a valid firearms licence.   Strengthen safe-storage laws to make it harder for legal weapons to fall into the hands of criminals.   Not bring back the long-gun registry.    Toronto Mayor John Tory, whose city has been reeling from eruptions of gun violence, has been calling for a national handgun ban for more than a year, but in August he said he would be happy with a city-wide ban.  ""It is a step in the right direction toward tougher gun control,"" he said Friday afternoon in response to the Liberal proposal.  Asked if he thinks Ontario Premier Doug Ford might try to block such a ban, Tory said the two politicians have a common interest in ""saving lives.""  He called on the next federal government to take action and make heavy investments to stop the smuggling of handguns from the U.S. into Canada.  Tony Bernardo, executive director of the Canadian Shooting Sports Association, said it is ""disappointing but typical"" for the Liberals to ""attack"" lawful firearms owners whenever they get into trouble.  ""Canada's firearms community is the go-to whipping boy of the Liberal Party, guaranteed to deflect attention away from the latest Liberal scandals,"" he said in a statement to CBC.  ""Trudeau's announcement raises more questions than answers. The Liberals have been unable to define what a military-style assault weapon is, or their role within crime.  ""Trudeau's hyperbolic rhetoric is purely designed to whip up public sentiment against our community and deflect from his own electoral problems, despite the statistical evidence that firearms owners are the most law-abiding people in our country ... and apparently unrepresented by the Liberal Party of Canada.""  Mixed reaction from gun control group  Heidi Rathjen, coordinator of the pro-gun control group Poly Remembers, had a mixed reaction to the Liberal promises, which she called long overdue.  She praised the semi-automatic rifle ban as ""great news, full stop,"" and praised the buyback program.  ""Canadians will be better protected against the risks associated with weapons specifically designed to kill humans rapidly and effectively,"" she said.  But Rathjen said she is disappointed by the plan to hand over to municipalities the responsibility for banning handguns, calling it inadequate and inefficient.    ""All one has to do is look at the glaring disaster south of the border resulting from a patchwork of state and local gun laws, where handguns easily transit from one jurisdiction to another, to see how misguided this approach is,"" she said in a statement.  ""This would also a guarantee protracted and contentious political battle in any municipality that considers further restrictions on handguns, and we doubt there is much appetite in municipalities to face off against the gun lobby when the federal government is clearly unwilling to do so, at least on the issue of handguns.""  The policy differences between the Liberals and Conservatives on guns are stark.  In a radio interview in Kitchener earlier this week, Trudeau accused Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer of ""being in the pocket"" of the gun lobby.  During an event in Saint John today, Scheer called that a ""ridiculous accusation"" made by a leader mired in scandal and desperate to change the channel.  Very different party positions  ""Our plan goes after the real criminals. We're going after illegal firearms, we're standing up for honest Canadians, farmers and hunters, people who use firearms responsibly and legally,"" he said.  ""It's easy to ask law-abiding Canadians to follow more laws. It's harder to go after the criminals and illegal firearms. Conservatives are ready to do the hard work that will actually improve safety in our communities.""",politics
155,Trudeau absent from Lilly Singh's prime-time special,"A group of stars joined late-night newcomer Lilly Singh for a prime-time TV special Wednesday night, but one special guest touted in advance — Canadian Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau — was missing.  Singh kicked off her debut as the sole female host of a main U.S. network late-night show, NBC's A Little Late with Lilly Singh, on Monday.   On Wednesday, NBC celebrated the crossover YouTuber star's debut week with a prime-time special featuring appearances by actors Mandy Moore, Milo Ventimiglia and Tony Hale, singer Christina Aguilera and comedian Kenan Thompson. Pop rock band 5 Seconds of Summer delivered a musical performance.  Earlier this week, however, in promotional material, NBC had also listed Trudeau as an expected guest.    The special aired late Wednesday evening, hours after news emerged Trudeau had appeared in brownface at a 2001 gala at the private school in Vancouver where he was teaching at the time.    In an apology issued Wednesday night, Trudeau admitted he had also performed in blackface for a talent show in high school in Montreal.  A representative from NBC Entertainment told CBC News they made a ""quick decision"" to remove the ""very short pre-taped segment of Justin Trudeau's appearance on Lilly's show."" The representative also confirmed there are no plans to air the segment in the future.   In her monologue for her Wednesday night episode, Singh mocked consumer brands for selling problematic products, including fashion designs that evoke blackface.  Trudeau has previously cheered Singh on via social media, most recently on Monday when he posted a good-luck message to the Toronto-born performer.",entertainment
156,Novartis halts distribution of Zantac drug amid probe into impurities,"Novartis AG's Sandoz unit said Wednesday it was halting distribution of its versions of the ranitidine drug known as Zantac in all its markets, including the United States and Canada, after contaminants were found in the heartburn drug.  The Swiss drugmaker's decision follows an investigation by U.S. and European regulators into the presence of the impurity, N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), in the ranitidine drug and a distribution halt in Canada announced late Tuesday.  ""Current evidence suggests that NDMA may be present in ranitidine, regardless of the manufacturer. As a result, and at Health Canada's request, companies marketing ranitidine products in Canada have stopped any further distribution until evidence is provided to demonstrate that they do not contain NDMA above acceptable levels,"" the regulator said.   Health Canada said the stop distribution request is an interim precautionary measure as it gathers more information and consults with international health regulators.  Branded versions of the drug such as Sanofi SA's Zantac are available for over-the-counter (OTC) sale in Canada, while generic versions are available for sale both OTC and with prescription.    Precautionary measure  Over-the-counter ranitidine is approved to prevent and relieve heartburn associated with acid indigestion and sour stomach. The prescription versions are used to reduce stomach acid to prevent and treat conditions, such as heartburn, ulcers of the stomach and intestines, and gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD, Health Canada said.   A distribution halt is different from a recall and means that existing stock of the drugs in pharmacies or stores can still be sold.  NDMA is classified as a probable human carcinogen, meaning long-term exposure to levels above what is considered safe could increase the risk of cancer.   Health Canada advised consumers:     Talk to your doctor or pharmacist at your earliest convenience about alternative, non-ranitidine treatment options appropriate for your health circumstances.    Individuals taking a prescription ranitidine drug, including a recalled product, should not stop taking it unless they have spoken to their health-care provider and obtained alternative treatment, as the risk of not treating the condition may be greater than the risk related to NDMA exposure.    Similarly, neither the U.S. Food and Drug Administration nor the European Medicines Agency had asked patients to stop taking the drug when the regulators said last week they were reviewing the safety of ranitidine.  Novartis said in an emailed statement its step was precautionary and adequate measures ""will be implemented in alignment with relevant health authorities as required.""  Ranitidine works by blocking the action of acid-producing cells in the stomach.   Last year, Health Canada announced recalls of some heart and high-blood pressure medications because of concerns surrounding the same impurity.",health
157,Brownface photo challenges Trudeau to prove who he really is,"Who is the real Mr. Trudeau?  The photo of Justin Trudeau wearing brownface at an event in 2001 had only just been published by Time magazine when Jagmeet Singh, upon finishing an event in Toronto, was asked for comment. And so the NDP leader, the first racialized Canadian ever to lead a federal party, was forced to come up with a response without having seen the image and before he could consult with his advisers.  After pausing for a few seconds to consider his response, Singh called the image (or at least the idea of it) ""troubling"" and ""insulting."" Then, he hit upon the question that may now weigh on Justin Trudeau for the next four weeks.  ""We see one Mr. Trudeau in public, that seems — I'll be honest with you, seems really nice, right? Very friendly, very warm in public. But behind closed doors he seems like he's a different Mr. Trudeau,"" Singh said, invoking Trudeau's curt dismissal of two Grassy Narrows protesters at a Liberal fundraiser in March. ""Who is the real Mr. Trudeau?""  There is no excuse for brownface. An event entitled ""Arabian Nights"" seems like a relic of the past, but there is no solace in this having been a different time. A white person donning brownface or blackface was never not wrong.  ""I shouldn't have done that. I should have known better, but I didn't and I'm really sorry,"" Trudeau said when he appeared before the cameras onboard the Liberal campaign plane. ""It was something that I didn't think was racist at the time, but now I recognize it was something racist to do and I am deeply sorry.""  That will surely not be enough. If there is any getting past this, Trudeau will have to do more. But he was at least wise enough to begin without equivocation.    The photo surely would have ended Trudeau's political ambitions if it had emerged during the 2015 campaign. The knock then was that he ""just wasn't ready,"" that he was callow and lacked seriousness. He was an unproven candidate applying for a job. This would have been enough to rule him out.  In the midst of the 2019 campaign, Trudeau can only hope that he has shown enough over the last four years to render the photo something less than a defining mistake.    Jarring image  It would be shocking to see any modern political leader in such a costume. But it is perhaps particularly jarring to see Trudeau, a leader who has made diversity and acceptance central elements of his message and appeal.  It was a theme when he launched his campaign for the Liberal leadership in 2012 and he held fast to it as nationalism and xenophobia roiled politics across the Western world.    The man who dressed up in brownface in 2001 went on to loudly condemn the Harper government's move to ban the niqab during the swearing of the citizenship oath and proudly embrace refugees from Syria. He and his government supported a parliamentary study of Islamophobia, launched a federal anti-racism strategy and funded a new ""Centre for Gender, Diversity and Inclusion Statistics.""  Five months ago, Trudeau stood in the House of Commons and delivered a strident speech on the threat of white supremacy.  All that could now come with a significant and prominent asterisk.  Singh: 'A lot of hurt'  Trudeau will be asked whether the photo from 2001 had occurred to him at all over the last 18 years and he will be asked to square this with his party's criticism of Conservatives for their past mistakes. But more important might be how he accounts for his own. While Trudeau apologized Wednesday evening, he did not consider aloud the hurt he may have caused.  ""Seeing this image is gonna be hard for a lot of people, it's going to bring up a lot of pain,"" Singh said in a second appearance on Wednesday night, after he had seen the photo. ""It's going to bring up a lot of hurt.""    Trudeau's connection to the public and his willingness to show compassion and emotion are among his most distinctive traits as a leader. He now needs to acknowledge the impact his actions may have on others, and to do that directly and in person with racialized Canadians and community leaders. He will also need to listen.  And ideally, it will be the voices of racialized Canadians that come to the fore.  All the while, Trudeau will have to continue campaigning for a second term, a task that he has already made harder for himself with unforced errors.    Near the end of his appearance before the cameras on Wednesday night, Trudeau was asked what he would be reflecting about the next few days.  ""I'm going to be thinking about how much harder I'm going to have to continue to work to demonstrate to Canadians that I'm focused on building a better world with less discrimination, less intolerance and less racism,"" he said.  The next four weeks will be about who the real Mr. Trudeau is and whether he is the right choice to lead this country.",politics
158,GM and UAW union making progress as strike enters third day,"Union and company bargainers are making progress toward a new contract as a strike by United Auto Workers that brought 33 General Motors factories to a halt continued into its third day.  Committees working on thorny issues such as wages, health insurance costs, use of temporary workers, and new work for plants slated to close worked until early evening Tuesday and are scheduled to resume bargaining early Wednesday.  UAW spokesman Brian Rothenberg said the talks were moving slowly but progressing.  Cost cutting a factor  More than 49,000 workers walked off their jobs on Monday in a dispute over the union's quest to get a bigger share of GM's profits and the company's goal of cutting labour costs so they're closer to those at U.S. auto plants run by foreign companies.  Health care costs and giving temporary workers a clear path to permanent jobs were two major sticking points in talks toward a new four-year contract.  On the picket lines, many workers were hoping for a quick resolution, but said they're willing to stay out as long as needed.  ""I can't see this lasting too long,"" said machinist Clarence Trinity as he carried a union sign at GM's engine and transmission factory in the Detroit suburb of Romulus, Michigan. ""Both sides are losing bad.""  Citi analyst Itay Michaeli, in a note to investors, estimated that the strike is costing the company $100 million per day in earnings. However, GM has enough inventory to supply dealers for 77 days at the current sales pace, although it's running lower on big SUVs, according to Cox Automotive.  1 week tipping point  If the strike ends soon, GM will be able to crank up production to make up for lost production time and mitigate some of the losses. But if it lasts more than a week, it will start to affect production in Canada and Mexico, putting more pressure on GM's inventory. If supplies dwindle, consumers may go to other brands, costing GM sales and market share.  GM and the union are negotiating at a time of troubling uncertainty for the U.S. auto industry.  GM is facing weakening sales, a deteriorating global economy and an unpredictable trade war as it tries to keep its labor costs in check through 2023. But workers want a bigger share of GM's healthy profits, which totaled more than $30 billion in the past five years.  Driven up by the longest economic expansion in American history, auto sales appear to have peaked and are heading down. Long-term challenges also loom: GM and other carmakers are struggling to make the transition to electric vehicles.  Gary Chaison, professor emeritus of industrial relations at Clark University in Massachusetts, expects the strike to end within a week. He sees it as more of a message to show how effective the union is, especially for nonunion workers who might be asked to join the UAW.  GM's offers, he said, seem to be pretty good, so the strike is a mystery to him. ""I can't see a prolonged strike coming out of this,"" he said. ""I think there's too much to lose and not enough to gain.""",business
159,From Scarborough to Hollywood and back: 2 star brothers promote homegrown talent,"Stephan James and brother Shamier Anderson are working with some of Hollywood's biggest talent — think Julia Roberts and Nicole Kidman — but they haven't forgotten their roots up north.  ""We have a responsibility,"" said Anderson. ""A black man coming from this country and being an actor working worldwide, I got to make sure that I keep striving for the best so I can continue to inspire other individuals ... making my family and my country proud.""  James, 25, and Anderson, 28, grew up in the Toronto borough of Scarborough. They credit their mother, a single parent, with believing in their acting skills and giving them roots. Anderson ventured into acting in 2010 and James followed soon after. Since then, the gigs have been steadily rolling in for both.  Anderson most recently starred opposite Kidman and Tatiana Maslany in the 2018 film Destroyer, is shooting a Netflix film in Toronto and was named one of TIFF's rising stars this year.    The same title was given to James in 2015. Since then, he's starred alongside Roberts in the podcast-based series Homecoming, now approaching its second season. He was nominated for a Golden Globe this year for the drama and walked the Oscars red carpet for his equally buzzy film starring Regina King and directed by Academy Award winner Barry Jenkins, If Beale Street Could Talk.  Combined, the Canadian brothers are taking Hollywood by storm — and using that profile to support more budding, diverse stars at home.  ""What me and my brother want to do is we want to find the talent here, the homegrown talent here, and show them the support now,"" said James.    'Huge celebration of incredibly talented Canadians'  And they're doing it in the form of the B.L.A.C.K. Ball, ""a huge celebration of incredibly talented Canadians,"" says James. It's become an annual event the brothers host in Toronto to promote rising Canadians in the business.  ""Even being in the system of the Canadian industry, we felt at the time there was a lack of support in the star system and building stars and fostering them and fostering talent and resources,"" said Anderson.    Among attendees this year, Avengers directors Joe and Anthony Russo and Canadian actress Amanda Brugel, who stars in the series The Handmaid's Tale. Brugel says an event like this couldn't be more timely as the entertainment industry moves toward more inclusion.  ""Everything has changed,"" said Brugel. ""I'm a 42-year-old woman of colour and I couldn't be busier … And the idea that it's not slowing down — that it's only starting to really rev up — gives me hope.""  Opening doors to inclusion  Brugel says the more gains made by Canadians — particularly actors of colour — the more doors that can open for others looking for role models. And that's one of James's main goals in returning home, says Elle Canada editor-in-chief Vanessa Craft. James is on the cover of the magazine's September issue.  ""We're finally embracing the talent that we have locally as opposed to looking outside our city for talent,"" said Craft.  ""One of the things Stephan said in our interview with him was, 'Why do I have to go to America to find heroes? To find someone to look up to? Why can't I just do that myself? Why can't I be one of those people?'""    For James and Anderson, it's only the beginning.  Anderson can next be seen opposite Gina Rodriguez in the upcoming film Awake. James will star in the action thriller 21 Bridges opposite Black Panther's Chadwick Boseman, produced by the Russo brothers.  ""We haven't stopped talking about him since we worked together,"" said Anthony Russo. ""Honestly, it's like we literally sit in a room at our studio [and say], 'What else can we put Stephan in?'""  Considering the Russo brothers directed the superhero blockbuster Avengers: Endgame, the highest grossing film of all time and have themselves capitalized on the power of sibling unity, they'll likely have no trouble finding an answer.",entertainment
160,Talks resume as UAW strike against GM enters second day,"Talks are set to resume Tuesday after a pause overnight, but there was no end to the strike against General Motors.  Brian Rothenberg, spokesman for the UAW, said Tuesday ""They are talking, they've made progress, we'll see how long it takes.""  Negotiators took a break from bargaining around 9 p.m. Monday but were to be back at the tables on Tuesday.  The walkout by upward of 49,000 United Auto Workers members has brought to a standstill more than 50 factories and parts warehouses in the union's first strike against the No. 1 U.S. automaker in over a decade.  Workers left factories and formed picket lines shortly after midnight Monday in the dispute over a new four-year contract. The union's top negotiator said in a letter to the company that the strike could have been averted had the company made its latest offer sooner.  The letter dated Sunday suggests that the company and union are not as far apart as the rhetoric leading up to the strike had indicated. Negotiations continued Monday in Detroit after breaking off during the weekend.  But Rothenberg said the two sides have come to terms on only two per cent of the contract.  ""We've got 98 per cent to go,"" he said Monday.    Asked about the possibility of federal mediation, U.S. President Donald Trump said it's possible if the company and union want it.  ""Hopefully they'll be able to work out the GM strike quickly,"" Trump said before leaving the White House for New Mexico. ""Hopefully, they're going to work it out quickly and solidly.""  Shares down 4%  Wall Street did not like seeing the union picketers. GM shares closed Monday down more than 4 per cent to $37.21 US. In premarket trading Tuesday, shares edged up 16 cents.  On the picket line Monday at GM's transmission plant in Toledo, Ohio, workers who said they have been with the company for more than 30 years were concerned for younger colleagues who are making less money under GM's two-tier wage scale and have fewer benefits.  Paul Kane, from South Lyon, Michigan, a 42-year GM employee, said much of what the union is fighting for will not affect him.      It's their turn to pay us back. That was the promise they gave.  - Paul Kane, GM employee     ""It's not right when you're working next to someone, doing the same job and they're making a lot more money,"" he said. ""They should be the making the same as me. They've got families to support.""  Kane said GM workers gave up pay raises and made other concessions to keep GM afloat during its 2009 trip through bankruptcy protection.  ""Now it's their turn to pay us back,"" he said. ""That was the promise they gave.""  UAW vice-president Terry Dittes told GM that the company's latest offer might have made it possible to reach an agreement if it had come earlier.  ""We are disappointed that the company waited until just two hours before the contract expired to make what we regard as its first serious offer,"" Dittes wrote in the letter to Scott Sandefur, GM's vice-president of labour relations.  There are many important items left in the talks, including wage increases, pay for new hires, job security, profit sharing and treatment of temporary workers, Dittes wrote.  ""We are willing to meet as frequently, and for as long as it takes, to reach an agreement that treats our members fairly,"" the letter said.  Pay raises, health benefits on the table  GM issued a statement saying it wants to reach a deal that builds a strong future for workers and the business.  Rothenberg said that GM on Monday cancelled the workers' company-sponsored health insurance, but the UAW had policies in place and is covering striking workers.  The automaker said Sunday that it offered pay raises and $7 billion worth of U.S. factory investments resulting in 5,400 new positions, a minority of which would be filled by existing employees. GM would not give a precise number. The company also said it offered higher profit sharing, ""nationally leading"" health benefits and an $8,000 payment to each worker upon ratification.  Before the talks broke off, GM offered new products to replace work at two of four U.S. factories that it intends to close.  The company pledged to build a new all-electric pickup truck at a factory in Detroit, according to a person who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The person was not authorized to disclose details of the negotiations.    Plant closures  The automaker also offered to open an electric vehicle battery plant in Lordstown, Ohio, where it has a huge factory that has already stopped making cars and will be closed. The new factory would be in addition to a proposal to make electric vehicles for a company called Workhorse, the person said.  It's unclear how many workers the two plants would employ. The closures, especially of the Ohio plant, have become issues in the 2020 presidential campaign. Trump has consistently criticized the company and demanded that Lordstown be reopened.    Kristin Dziczek, vice-president of labour and industry for the Center for Automotive Research, an industry think-tank , said the letter and resumption of contract talks are encouraging signs. ""It makes me think that both sides are probably closer than it might have seemed before,"" she said.  But both Dziczek and Art Wheaton, an auto industry expert at the Worker Institute at Cornell University, say GM left out key details when it made part of its offer public, and working out those details could make the strike last longer.  ""I think GM kind of sabotaged some of the negotiations by going immediately to the public,"" Wheaton said. ""It really distorts the offer.""  The strike shut down 33 manufacturing plants in nine states across the U.S., as well as 22 parts-distribution warehouses. It's the first national strike by the union since a two-day walkout in 2007 that had little impact on the company.  Workers at Fiat Chrysler and Ford continued working under contract extensions. Any agreement reached with GM will serve as a template for talks with the other two companies.",business
161,Autoworkers at GM's Oshawa plant ask feds for more than $1B to build electric vehicles,"Workers at the General Motors Oshawa assembly plant are calling on the federal government to fund a project that would transform the site into a publicly owned electric vehicle factory.  The group, called Green Jobs Oshawa, revealed details of the plan at a public forum on Thursday evening.  ""What could make more sense than the government stepping in and saying, 'We will ensure that we will keep jobs here, that we develop the technology here and that we build the vehicles of the future here?'"" said Tony Leah, chairperson of the Local 222 Political Action Committee.  The Oshawa factory is one of five North American assembly plants owned by GM that are set to close at the end of the year. GM plans to turn the site into smaller-scale stamping and testing facility after 2019.  GM employs around 2,500 workers at the facility, which has been a pillar of Canada's auto industry since it opened in 1907.  ""It would mean the world to me if we could get this to come to fruition,"" said Rebecca Keetch, who works as an assembler.  The proposal to preserve auto manufacturing in Oshawa calls for a federal investment of $1.4 billion to $1.9 billion to transform the existing facility into a plant that would produce electric vehicles for government agencies such as Canada Post.  The study says the transformation would preserve around 13,000 jobs in Oshawa, leading to sales of 150,000 vehicles over the plant's first four years at a value of approximately $5.8 billion.     Those vehicles could also lead to a reduction of 400,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions over four years, according to the study, which was authored by consultant Russ Christianson.    Green Jobs Oshawa says achieving those lofty goals will require federal participation.  The group points to Ottawa's bailout of Canada's auto industry during the global financial crisis of 2008, when the federal government handed $13.7 billion to GM and Chrysler as the companies teetered on the verge of bankruptcy.  ""Any nation in the world that has a strong auto industry has a strong auto industry because of government participation,"" added Unifor national president Jerry Dias.  Bold idea, or 'job creation scheme?'  Bernie Wolf, a professor emeritus at York University's Schulich School of Business, described the plan as a ""job creation scheme"" that would be difficult to justify.  ""If this were really feasible, if this were really possible, wouldn't GM be doing this itself?"" asked Wolf, who studies the auto industry and vehicle manufacturing.    He said a government-owned plant would struggle to develop the technology needed to produce high-quality electric vehicles, meaning the plant would likely have to import technology from private companies.  Government agencies such as Canada Post could also purchase electric vehicles at lower prices from more established manufacturers, he argued.    ""The more I think about it, the less sense it makes,"" he added. Spending money educating workers would be a wiser long term investment, he argued.  While Wolf was skeptical of the plan, electric vehicle researcher Olivier Trescases called the idea an ""interesting and timely opportunity.""    Trescases, who runs the University of Toronto's Electric Vehicle Research Centre, said the project could succeed if it maintains a strict focus on producing vehicles for government use.  ""I think that aiming for government owned EV fleets and electrified public transportation is strategically very important and more logical than trying to produce passenger cars though a Crown corporation,"" he wrote in an email.  More hurdles to clear  While there is no indication that the next federal government would commit to such an expensive and ambitious project, there is some precedent for that type of acquisition.  In 1974, Ottawa purchased the aircraft manufacturer de Havilland, which produced the Dash series of turboprop regional airliners. However, the government sold the company to Boeing in 1986.  The German courier Deutsche Post, which was privatized in 1995, also purchased the electric vehicle company StreetScooter in 2014. It now has 10,000 electric vehicles in its fleet.    However, it is unclear if the publicly owned Canada Post has the capacity or desire to purchase several thousand electric vehicles.  In 2018, Canada Post purchased 500 hybrid delivery vehicles, which are going into service this year. In a statement to CBC, the Crown corporation said it ""continues to consider alternative propulsion technologies that can be rolled out at scale, including electric vehicles.""  Green Jobs Oshawa has acknowledged some of those logistical and financial challenges, but the group says the project should also be considered for its potential benefits to the environment and local community.  ""We have to look at a broader picture than just a bottom line,"" Leah said.",business
162,Everything you need to know about the 'repo loan' problem — and why it matters to you,"As if the U.S. Federal Reserve did not already have enough on its plate heading into its meeting on interest rates this week, chaos deep inside the plumbing of the U.S. financial system has thrown policymakers an unexpected curveball.  Cash available to banks for their short-term funding needs all but dried up earlier this week, and interest rates in U.S. money markets shot up to as high as 10 per cent for some overnight loans, more than four times the Fed's rate.     ANALYSIS: Why rates cuts in the U.S. will impact Canada    That forced the Fed to make an emergency injection of more than $125 billion over the past two days, its first major market intervention since the financial crisis more than a decade ago, to prevent borrowing costs from spiraling even higher. While the effort restored a measure of order to the short-term bank funding market, it was not enough to stop the Fed's benchmark lending rate from rising this week above its targeted range of 2.00 per cent to 2.25 per cent.  The exact cause of the squeeze is a matter of some debate, but most market participants agree that two coincidental events on Monday were at least partly to blame. First, corporations had to withdraw funds from money market accounts to pay for quarterly tax bills, and on the same day the banks and investors who bought the $78 billion of U.S. Treasury notes and bonds sold by Uncle Sam last week had to settle up.  On top of that, the reserves that banks park with the Fed and are often made available to other banks on an overnight basis are at their lowest since 2011 thanks to the central bank's culling of its vast portfolio of bonds over the past few years.  Added together, these factors are testing the limits of the $2.2 trillion repurchase agreement — or ""repo"" — market, a grey but essential component of the U.S. financial system.  Whatever the cause, the episode has added fuel to the argument that the Fed needs to take steps to avoid more disruptions in the repo market down the road.  Why is the 'repo' market important?  The repo market underpins much of the U.S. financial system, helping to ensure banks have the liquidity to meet their daily operational needs and maintain sufficient reserves.  In a repo trade, Wall Street firms and banks offer U.S. Treasuries and other high-quality securities as collateral to raise cash, often overnight, to finance their trading and lending activities. The next day, borrowers repay their loans plus what is typically a nominal rate of interest and get their bonds back. In other words, they repurchase, or repo, the bonds.  The system typically hums along with the interest rate charged on repo deals hovering close to the Fed's benchmark overnight rate, which it cut on Wednesday to 1.75 per cent to 2.00 per cent, from 2.00 per cent to 2.25 per cent.  But when investors get fearful of lending, as seen during the global credit crisis, or when there are just not enough reserves or cash in the system to lend out, it sends the repo rate soaring above the Fed Funds rate, because banks are desperate enough to pay the higher fees to meet their obligations.    Trading in stocks and bonds can become difficult. It can also pinch lending to businesses and consumers and, if the disruption is prolonged, it can become a drag on a U.S. economy that relies heavily on the flow of credit.  What has cause the drop in cash reserves at banks?  Coming out of the financial crisis, after the Fed cut interest rates to near zero and bought more than $3.5 trillion of bonds, banks built up massive reserves held at the Fed.  But that level of bank reserves, which peaked at nearly $2.8 trillion, began falling when the Fed started raising interest rates in late 2015. They fell even faster when the Fed started to cut the size of its bond portfolio about two years later.  The Fed stopped raising interest rates last year and cut them in July and again on Wednesday. It has also now ceased allowing bonds to roll off its balance sheet.  The question vexing policymakers now is whether those actions are enough to stop the downward drift in reserves, which are a main source of liquidity in funding markets like repo.  Bank reserves at the Fed last stood at $1.47 trillion, the lowest level since 2011 and nearly 50 per cent below their peak from five years ago.  What can policy makers do to calm the repo market?  Broadly, there are 4 options:     Run spot repo operations. Through the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Fed can conduct occasional spot repo operations at times of funding stress, allowing banks and dealers to swap their Treasuries and other high-quality securities for cash at a minimal interest rate. It did this on Tuesday and Wednesday.   Lower the interest rate it pays on excess reserves. By making it less profitable for banks, especially foreign ones, to leave their reserves at the Fed, it may encourage banks to lend to each other in money markets.   Create a permanent repo facility. Such a permanent financing program will allow eligible participants to exchange their bonds for cash at a set interest rate. The Fed and its staff have considered such a facility, but they have not determined who qualifies, what would be the level of interest paid and the timing for a possible launch.   Ramp up the buying of Treasuries. The Fed can replenish the level of bank reserves by slightly increasing its holdings of U.S. government debt. This comes with the risk that it may be perceived as a resurrection of quantitative easing rather than a technical adjustment.    What did the Fed do?  The central bank lowered interest on excess reserves by 30 basis points, to 1.80 per cent. The rate now sits 20 basis points below the top of the target range, compared to 15 basis points previously.  It also set its offering rate in the repo market at 1.70 per cent, five basis points below the bottom of the new target range for the policy rate.",business
163,"Montreal man has $800 in rolled change, but his bank won't deposit the money","Julien Perrotte stood in front of the representative at his local bank last week, unsure he properly understood what she was telling him.  He was carrying about $800 worth of coins, sorted and rolled, that he had collected over the past year. But she said Laurentian Bank wouldn't deposit them.  ""I'm like, 'It doesn't make sense,'"" Perrotte told CBC News.  The woman told him he could exchange the coins for bills at local grocery stores, corner stores and pharmacies because ""they love coins.""  But Perrotte, who works as an independent insurance claims adjuster, says he doesn't have time to shop around for a small business to take his change — especially when it's a service he expects to receive from his bank.  He called Laurentian Bank's customer service line to see if there was any other way the bank would take his hundreds of loonies and toonies.  He was told it was a new policy at the bank not to accept coins.  ""Pretty much, I was exasperated,"" said Perrotte, who has been a member of Laurentian Bank for 15 years.  ""It's so absurd.… Everyone has coins, that's for sure. Poor people, rich people.""  The other option Perrotte considered was to exchange the coins at a Coinstar machine, which are at some grocery stores and malls, but the machines charge about 12 per cent in fees for the service.  ""So I would lose like 80 bucks just to try to get rid of money. And my bank doesn't want my money!"" Perrotte said.  Some bank branches going cashless      As Perrotte points out, the Royal Canadian Mint is still producing coins as legal tender. But he now wonders who is ensuring that banks will take them.  He's worried other banks will follow Laurentian's lead.  In a response to a request for comment from CBC News, Royal Canadian Mint spokesperson Alex Reeves said the Crown corporation's mandate is limited to manufacturing and distributing Canadian currency.  It has no authority over how coins are exchanged, he wrote in an email.       The future of cash in Canada     ""Canadian businesses are free to determine what forms of legal tender they will accept as payments or deposits,"" Reeves said.  Reeves noted CIBC's decision to open some cashless branches as an example of ""the level of discretion allowed in Canada.""  A Canadian Bankers Association spokesperson told CBC News that the majority of financial institutions that take cash deposits still accept rolled coins at their branches.  'If they don't want to take my money, I'll change banks'  In a statement, Laurentian Bank said it ""transitioned its branch network from a traditional offer to 100% Advice.""  Spokesperson Hélène Soulard wrote that the ""only service no longer offered in our 100% Advice model to retail customers is the deposit of coins.""  Notes can still be deposited via the bank's network of automated banking machines.  Perrotte says he understands the bank's need to cut costs, but wonders whether Laurentian Bank is having more trouble than it lets on.  ""I love my bank. I live right near it, it's my neighbour. It's a nice bank, but at the end of the day if they don't want to take my money I'll change banks,"" he said.    Laurentian Bank is in the process of implementing a transformation plan with the goal of boosting profits and doubling in size as more Canadians use online banking services.  In February, the bank said it would lay off about 300 employees and close 50 branches this year in an effort to save up to $20 million per year in operating costs.  In July, the bank announced it was phasing out tellers at its physical locations.  In its quarterly report ending in July, the bank reported a profit of $47.8 million, down nearly 13 per cent when compared to a year earlier.  ""I would be OK, as a millennial, to stop the coins and just go full electronic,"" said Perrotte.  But as long as coins are still in circulation, he says that banks should still take them.   In its quest to compete with digital startups, Perrotte says Laurentian Bank just lost a customer.",business
164,B.C.'s 911 system to be revamped after fatal 35-minute rescue delay,"Changes are coming to B.C.'s 911 system, after an external investigation ordered by B.C.'s health minister found response delays ""possibly influenced"" the death of a Vancouver woman.  In November, Tracey Gundersen, 56 — a Downtown Eastside resident with a drug addiction — called 911 after she started to hemorrhage.  It took ambulance attendants 35 minutes to reach her, because doors and an elevator in her secure building were locked and firefighters with master keys were called in too late.   Now, an independent review has found Gundersen's death may have been avoidable. It makes 14 recommendations ""to improve care of future patients"" and prevent deaths, including having firefighters attend whenever access might be an issue.  The investigation was ordered by Health Minister Adrian Dix after a direct appeal from Gundersen's daughter— a police emergency call-taker.  ""No one should call for help and not receive it,"" said Chelsea Brent, 26.    ""It brings me to tears often because it's not something that you ever wish on someone; to die alone and scared and wondering if help was ever going to arrive.""  Dix agrees.  ""This is a serious case. It's a tragic case. It's a heartbreaking case,"" he said. ""There are lessons to be learned and that's why I did it.""    Chilling 911 call  According to the investigation, Gundersen frantically phoned 911 at 8:15 a.m. on Nov. 8, 2018 to report she was hemorrhaging.  ""My groin, it's abscessed and it's bleeding profusely,"" she says in a recording obtained by Brent through a freedom of information request.  An ambulance is dispatched within one minute to Gundersen's low-income apartment complex at 250 Powell street— a former high-security provincial remand centre.  ""There's lotsa help on the way,"" assures the male call-taker.  He tells Gundersen to apply pressure with a towel, but the blood seeps through.  ""I'm getting all dizzy … all dizzy in the head,"" she states four minutes later.  At the five minute mark, the ambulance siren can be heard in the background.  ""I can't put any pressure on it,"" says Gundersen, referring to the bleeding abscess. ""I can't handle opening the door.""  ""Okay … we're gonna figure-out a way in, okay?"" promises the call-taker.  But the ambulance attendants hit the locked doors of her building and Gundersen starts to fade.  ""I've lost that much blood I'm blurry,"" she says. ""Oh please!""  Thirty seconds later, Gundersen utters her last intelligible words on the recording.  ""Please hurry.""    Ten minutes later, around 8:32 a.m., records show ambulance dispatch calls Fire for assistance.  Although a fire hall is one block away, a more distant fire crew takes another 10 minutes to arrive.  At 8:50 a.m., emergency crews finally gain access to Gundersen's sixth floor apartment — 35 minutes after she first called 911.   It's too late.  She's found with no pulse. All resuscitation methods fail.  Firefighters' role expanded  The 26-page report investigating Gundersen's death was authored by two emergency care experts, one from B.C., the other from Ontario.  They call for better communication and coordination among call-takers, dispatchers, ambulance and fire — and for firefighters to attend all medical calls where access might be an issue.  All 14 recommendations will be implemented, said Dix.  He denies the changes will roll-back a controversial policy introduced in May 2018, which stopped firefighters from responding to all but urgent medical calls — a move that was supposed to improve the efficient use of ambulance and fire crews.  ""I don't think it's a rollback at all. It just makes sense,"" said Dix. ""Let's get on with making the service better.""    'I can't say a policy killed her, but...'  Brent blames the policy change made six months before Gundersen's 911 call for the delay that may have contributed to her mother's death.  In addition to cutting the number of medical calls attended by both ambulance and fire, B.C. Emergency Health Services (BCEHS) brought in a colour-coded ranking system.  At the time, BCEHS, which oversees emergency dispatching in the province, promised the moves would ""better match resources to patient needs.""    Gundersen's call was labelled a mid-level ""code orange,"" which means ""urgentu002Fpotentially serious,"" but ""not immediately life-threatening.""  As a result, firefighters were not dispatched with the ambulance crew. Without master keys, the paramedics couldn't access Gundersen's locked building.  ""I can't say a policy killed her,"" says Brent, ""but I can say where [the emergency dispatch system] was in April or May 2018, it would have been a lot different.""  Fire and Ambulance react  In a statement, the head of B.C. Emergency Health Services said she welcomes any new recommendations from the independent investigation.  Barb Fitzsimmons said BCEHS will work with the health ministry ""to make changes needed to prevent something like this from happening again.""  Vancouver Fire Chief Darrell Reid, speaking through a spokesperson, said he needs time to review the report before commenting.  'Something did go drastically wrong'  Brent said she's ""very appreciative"" B.C.'s health minister listened to her plea for a review of her mother's death.  ""He did approve this policy change and people had said 'this is going to go wrong,'"" said Brent. ""And something did go drastically wrong. I think maybe he just saw …this isn't the right option, maybe things do need to change.""  Brent wanted to fight one last fight for her mother.  ""My Mom did not receive the respect and the care that I feel she could have received,"" she said.  ""I know she never loved attention, but I think she would be thankful.""

165,'This is ground zero': Conservative ex-MPs try to win back crucial GTA seats,"Six former MPs in the Greater Toronto Area are aiming for a political comeback by trying to regain crucial seats for the federal Conservative Party.  Their victories in swing ridings in 2011 were key to Stephen Harper's majority, while their subsequent defeats in 2015 heralded the Liberal Party's domination of the GTA under Justin Trudeau.   How these six candidates perform on election night in October will give a strong indication of the success of Andrew Scheer's 2019 campaign.     Etobicoke Centre: Ted Opitz   Mississauga-Lakeshore: Stella Ambler   Mississauga East-Cooksville: Wladyslaw Lizon   Newmarket-Aurora: Lois Brown   Oakville: Terence Young   Richmond Hill: Costas Menegakis    All six are considered target ridings by Scheer's Conservatives for multiple reasons, including their suburban makeup, the candidates' past wins, and the victories of Doug Ford's Progressive Conservatives there in last year's Ontario election.   ""This is ground zero. This is where we have to win if we're going to win government,"" said Stella Ambler, the Conservative candidate in Mississauga-Lakeshore.    Ambler served as the riding's MP from 2011 to 2015. Her loss by 3,700 votes was the tightest race in the Liberals' 2015 sweep of Mississauga's six seats.  ""Sure it's hard to lose, but honestly you can't take it personally, this business,"" said Ambler in an interview.    She said her decision to try again after the loss wasn't actually difficult, but required a little personal backtracking. ""My husband reminded me that I said four years ago that I would never do this again,"" Ambler said with a laugh.        Other party candidates in Mississauga-Lakeshore    Cynthia Trentelman (Green)   Eugen Vizitiu (People's Party)    The NDP has not yet named a candidate       For Ambler, it is a rematch of her 2015 race against Sven Spengemann of the Liberals, but this time he is the incumbent.  ""It's a totally different campaign, the feeling is different,"" said Ambler.  The voters of Mississauga-Lakeshore are ""open-minded,"" she said. ""They gave Justin Trudeau a chance but this time they're not gonna do it, so I'm confident it's going to swing back.""    Signalling the importance of Etobicoke Centre to the Conservatives, Scheer made Ted Opitz's campaign office a stop on his leader's tour Wednesday afternoon.  Opitz admits his 2015 loss was disappointing, but says he's always kept the possibility of a comeback in mind.  ""The decision was actually easier than I thought it would be,"" he said in an interview. ""I enjoyed being in Parliament, I enjoyed serving.""     Opitz is not facing an incumbent, as the Liberal he lost to in 2015, Borys Wrzesnewskyj, isn't running. The Liberal candidate is Yvan Baker, who represented the riding provincially at Queen's Park for a term before losing in 2018.     ""It's a tough riding to win and you can take nothing for granted,"" said Opitz. His 2011 win was about as tight as it gets, by a margin of 26 votes. It wasn't sealed until the following year, when a Supreme Court of Canada ruling upheld his victory.    Among the other former Conservative MPs seeking a comeback in GTA ridings, both Brown in Newmarket-Aurora and Young are contesting their fifth straight federal election. Each lost in 2006, won in 2008 and 2011, and lost in 2015. Both are facing first-time Liberal candidates as the incumbents are not seeking re-election.    Menegakis's defeat in 2015 came in the riding of Aurora - Oak Ridges - Richmond Hill. He'd switched to contesting that riding after the boundaries for Richmond Hill were re-drawn.",politics
166,"Trudeau promises to raise basic personal deduction to $15K, cut cellphone bills","Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau says his party would raise the basic personal income tax deduction to $15,000 and cut cellphone bills by a quarter if re-elected in October.  The cost of cell service is controlled by the ""Big 3"" companies — Rogers, Telus and Bell — who share a near-monopoly on Canada's wireless networks. A Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission report found that the three controlled 91 per cent of all wireless service revenues in 2016.  Canadians pay some of the highest cell bills in the world, with monthly plans ranging from around $40 to over $100.  Trudeau said the Liberal proposal would save the average family almost $1,000 a year.   To lower the cost, the Liberals say they would open up the market to more competition and work with cell companies to offer plans that more closely mirror global prices. They would also implement an unlimited family plan. More rules could kick in after two years if the prices don't decrease enough.    How much that proposal would cost is unclear.  ""We know that Canadians are concerned about affordability,"" Trudeau said.  Earlier this week the NDP also put out their plan to cap prices of cellphone and internet services — which would save families an estimated $250 a year.    In a statement on Sunday, Robert Ghiz, president and CEO of the Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Association, which represents most of the country's major carriers,  said wireless prices have already come down around 30 per cent over the past three years — and will continue to decrease.  ""As we enter a world of 5G, it is critical that we encourage investment in network technology, the backbone of the Canadian economy,"" Ghiz said.""We need to balance driving affordability with investing long-term so Canadians continue to enjoy world-class networks.""  Basic personal income deduction to rise  The Liberals crammed a second, unrelated promise into Trudeau's appearance in Brampton, Ont. Like most others of this campaign, it was also focused on affordability.  Trudeau said a Liberal government would raise the basic personal income tax deduction to $15,000 for people earning under $147,000 — meaning you would only pay taxes on income over that amount. Currently, the basic personal deduction is $12,069. The increase would be phased in, reaching $15,000 by 2023.  The Liberals estimate this will save an individual just under $300 a year, while families would save $585.   ""We have to realize that the cost of living is going up,"" Trudeau said.    The tax cut would cost $2.9 billion to start, increasing to $5.6 billion by 2023-2024.  The Liberals haven't released costing of several promises through the Parliamentary Budget Officer's new program that allows parties to submit their campaign proposals for costing. They have faced criticism for it.   Trudeau said the tax cut would lift 40,000 people out of poverty and the party added it would encompass about 700,000 more Canadians.   ""We have a sustainable fiscal plan,"" Trudeau said.   The Liberals were running a $15-billion deficit before the campaign and have been cagey about a timeline back to balance. The party has promised a fully costed platform, but it has not been released yet.   The Conservatives have already announced a tax cut of a different kind. Last week Andrew Scheer said a Conservative government would cut the tax rate on taxable income under $47,630 to 13.75 per cent from 15 per cent.  The party says that would save the average single taxpayer about $444 a year. A two-income couple earning an average salary would save about $850 a year.",politics

168,"New Liberal gun-control policies coming soon, as firearms lobby gears up for a fight","A re-elected Liberal government will ban some types of ""assault-style"" rifles, as well as introduce additional restrictions on where firearms can be possessed or stored, according to Bill Blair, who has been the party's pointman on gun control.  The planned measures will be announced ""very, very shortly"" as part of the Liberals' campaign platform, Blair said in an interview with The Fifth Estate.   ""I have recommended that there are certain weapons that are currently not prohibited that should be prohibited, which means no one should be allowed to have those weapons in our society,"" he said.  ""I will tell you that I am confident that a Liberal government will enact effective regulation and legislation … to remove weapons that are, in my opinion, just too dangerous in a civil society.""    One particular firearm in Blair's sights is the AR-15, which has been used in multiple U.S. mass shootings, including at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., an outdoor music festival in Las Vegas and Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.  ""That weapon was designed for — and has always been intended for — the killing of enemy combatants. It is not a toy,"" said Blair, who served as the minister for organized crime reduction under the last government.  'A really important time for gun owners'  Canada's gun lobby has been expecting a gun ban from the Liberals, and several groups say they are mobilizing their members to vote in October's federal election like never before.   There are 2.2 million men and women who own gun licences in Canada.  ""This is a really important time for gun owners,"" said Tracey Wilson, of the Canadian Coalition for Firearm Rights (CCFR). ""It has never been more true than it is right now. This is it.""    The issue of gun control was thrust back into the spotlight after another violent shooting in the Greater Toronto Area over the weekend. A 17-year-old was killed and five others injured in Mississauga, Ont., and police say they're looking for multiple gunmen, armed mostly with semi-automatic weapons.  The ""ambush-style"" shooting prompted comments from all three major party leaders.    As part of their platform for the 2015 election, the Liberals blamed former prime minister Stephen Harper for weakening the country's gun laws ""in ways that make Canadians more vulnerable and communities more dangerous.""  ""We will take action to get handguns and assault weapons off our streets,"" the party declared at the time.  Nathalie Provost says she was initially encouraged by the pledge. Provost was among those shot during the 1989 attack at Montreal's École Polytechnique and has been championing stricter gun regulations in Canada for years.   In 2017, the Liberal government appointed her vice-chair of a committee to advise the public safety minister on Canada's gun policies.    But this summer, Provost quit in frustration, saying she was ""extremely disappointed"" in the ""obviously useless"" consultations that preceded the Liberals' firearms legislation, Bill C-71, which enhanced background checks on gun buyers, but did not prohibit handguns or semi-automatic rifles.  ""From my own point of view, they lack courage,"" said Provost. ""They lack the will to do something that we need to be done.""  Bill C-71 faced strong opposition from gun rights advocates, who maintain the legislation will do little, if anything, to actually reduce gun-related crime in Canada, particularly for firearms smuggled in from the U.S.    Even before the election campaign began, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer vowed to repeal the legislation.  The most recent poll on the issue, conducted by the Angus Reid Institute, found 75 per cent of Canadians, including a majority of gun owners themselves, support a ban on assault-style weapons.   ""If we were in a democracy, we'd have had a ban on assault weapons a long time ago,"" said Heidi Rathjen, a graduate of École Polytechnique.   In 1991, Rathjen brought petitions signed by more than a half-million Canadians to Parliament Hill, demanding a ban on semi-automatic weapons like the gun used at École Polytechnique.    ""It's not happening and the only explanation is the strength of the gun lobby,"" she said. ""The gun lobby is winning in the long run. It's getting worse.""  For people like Blair Hagen, vice-president of the National Firearms Association, just defeating the Liberals on Oct. 21 isn't enough. He wants a constitutional change to enshrine the right to bear arms in Canada, just like the U.S.  ""There's been a lot of talk about that, and a lot of talk about property rights,"" said Hagen, who manages a gun store in Vancouver. ""Firearms are property in this country — and I think that's something that governments often forget.""    Blair rejects that argument, saying ""we don't have a Second Amendment here.""  ""Firearm ownership in this country is a privilege,"" he said. ""It's a privilege earned by people who would adhere to our laws and our regulations. And if they don't adhere to our laws and regulations, they lose that privilege.""  Tony Bernardo, of the Canadian Shooting Sports Association (CSSA), said he doesn't consider guns and rifles — including the controversial AR-15 — as weapons.   ""They're firearms … Weapons are things that are used to hurt people; 2.2 million Canadians use this as a sport and don't hurt anybody,"" he said.    His organization has had success fighting proposed gun bans before. In 2014, it lobbied the Harper government to override the RCMP firearms program when it wanted to prohibit the CZ-858 rifle.  The Fifth Estate obtained a 2013 RCMP report which said their testing revealed the gun could be converted to a fully automatic — and therefore illegal — firearm ""in a relatively short period of time with relative ease."" The firearms program found that ""neither specialized tools nor skilled workmanship were required"" to modify the gun into one capable of firing multiple rounds with a single squeeze of the trigger.  Still, in 2015, the Conservatives passed Bill C-42, which gave the government the power to override RCMP firearms' classifications, and the government reversed the prohibited classification of the CZ-858.  Current licensing system  Hagen criticizes the current Canadian gun-licensing system for focusing on ""people who want to be law-abiding.""   ""They're focused on people who go through the whole regime of getting a licence,"" he said. ""How do Canada's restrictions on firearms prevent [mass shootings]? Apparently they don't.""  Mass shootings with assault-style firearms are rare in Canada, but have happened.   Alexandre Bissonnette used a legally owned gun to attack a mosque in Quebec City in 2017, killing six men and seriously wounding five others.  And Kimveer Gill, who carried out a shooting at Montreal's Dawson College in 2006, was also a legal gun owner. École Polytechnique attacker Marc Lepine was a legal firearm owner, too.    For her part, Provost doesn't dispute that most firearms owners who hunt or engage in sport shooting are law-abiding. ""But what … they are playing with is extraordinarily dangerous,"" she said.  A mere rumour of a ban earlier this year prompted some members of the Canadian gun lobby to mount a unique campaign against it, imploring supporters to go out and buy AR-15s.  ""Buy one, buy two, buy three — buy whatever you can,"" said Wilson, of the CCFR. ""Let them know that Bill Blair sent you, that Bill Blair is Canada's biggest gun salesman.""    After that call out, some gun stores claimed to have run out of the popular rifle.   As for Provost and Rathjen, they say they're going to keep using their voices, too, as they ready to mark three decades since the École Polytechnique shooting later this year.   ""I think it's very sad that the witnesses and victims of the Polytechnique massacre still have to fight 30 years later to get in common-sense gun control,"" Rathjen said.

169,Inflation rate nudges down to 1.9% as gasoline and vegetables got cheaper,"Canada's inflation rate cooled to a 1.9 per cent annual rate in August, Statistics Canada says, as the price of gasoline, fresh vegetables and fruit all got cheaper during the month.  August's rate came in 0.1 percentage point below July's level.  After bottoming out at 1.4 per cent in January, Canada's inflation rate has been at 1.9 per cent or above for six months in a row now.  Cheaper gasoline was one of the biggest factors in the cooling, as gasoline was 10 per cent cheaper in August 2019 than it was the same month a year earlier. The impact of that cheaper gas is so great that if gasoline is stripped out of the data, Canada's inflation rate would have been much higher — 2.4 per cent.  Canadians also paid 6.5 per cent less for fresh vegetables in August compared with July, marking the largest month-over-month decline in five years.   The price of a hotel room also fell, as the cost of traveller accommodation has fallen by 6.7 per cent in the past year. Travel accomodation costs have now fallen on an annualized basis for 14 months in a row.  On the flipside, the price of some things increased, which helped keep the overall inflation rate up. They include air fare, which has risen by 10.3 per cent in the 12 months up to  the end of August.  Natural gas prices have also risen by 5.8 per cent during that time frame.  All things being equal, a lower inflation rate means that the Bank of Canada should be less likely to cut its rate in the near future, since it's a sign the economy isn't overheating. Currently, trading in investments known as overnight index swaps implies there's about a 1 in 5 chance of a rate cut from the Bank of Canada when it meets next month.  Despite the relatively benign inflation rate, economist James Marple at Toronto-Dominion Bank expects the bank will have to cut its rate eventually, because trade war tensions are making most central banks nervous.  ""We would not be surprised to see the Bank take out some insurance in the form of a rate cut later this year, moving it closer to the majority of its advanced economy peers,"" he said.",business
170,Why wearing blackface or brownface is considered 'reprehensible',"Dressing in blackface or brownface is a hurtful, racist and offensive act that mocks, dehumanizes and belittles other cultures while feeding into some of the worst stereotypes of people of colour, community leaders and experts say, reacting to the actions of Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau.  Their comments follow revelations Trudeau wore brownface as part of a costume at an Arabian Nights-themed gala in 2001, and his admission he wore blackface makeup at an event during high school.  ""I think that they're both reprehensible in the sense that the idea is that these communities can be replaced,"" said Tariq Amin-Khan, an associate professor of political science at Ryerson University in Toronto.  People with brown or black skin may feel demonized, ""and I think that that's something that should be quite upsetting for anyone,"" he said.  On Wednesday night in Halifax, Trudeau apologized for dressing up in brownface and a turban for a 2001 gala at the Vancouver private school where he was a teacher. He also admitted that at a talent show when he was in high school, he wore black makeup and sang The Banana Boat Song (Day-O), a Jamaican folk tune made famous by black American singer Harry Belafonte.    The 2001 incident was brought to light Wednesday evening with the publication of an article in Time magazine that showed a picture of Trudeau, with darkened skin and hands, dressed up like the fictional character Aladdin. A second picture later emerged of Trudeau at a talent show at Le collège Jean-de-Brébeuf in Montreal.  Speaking to reporters on his campaign plane Wednesday evening, Trudeau apologized for his actions, saying he now recognizes they were racist.    'Unacceptable' mythology  Carl Everton James, a professor of eduction at Toronto's York University who researches race and racism, said those kinds of actions are significant because of what brown skin and black skin have come to mean in society.   ""Are we doing it because we're saying brown skin or black skin are a noblesse skin colour and therefore we are going to imitate those people?      At one level it shows that Justin Trudeau's understanding about race and racism doesn't seem to have deep roots.  - Tariq Amin-Khan, associate professor, Ryerson University     ""Or do we see it as a way in which certain kinds of people are not quite like the 'white skin colour' and therefore, we do that,"" he added. ""So it becomes offensive because of what it represents.""  In an emotional statement, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh talked about the racism he has endured in his life, saying that seeing the image of Trudeau in brownface jarred him. He said it's ""going to bring up a lot of pain, it's going to bring up a lot of hurt.  ""The kids that see this image, the people that see this image, are going to think about all of the times in their life that they were made fun of, that they were hurt, and that they were hit, and they were insulted and they were made to feel less because of who they are.""    Although he thanked Trudeau for his apology, Mustafa Farooq, executive director of the National Council of Canadian Muslims, said in a statement that Trudeau's actions are ""deeply saddening,"" and wearing blackface and brownface is ""reprehensible.""    ""[It] hearkens back to a history of racism, slavery and an Orientalist mythology that is unacceptable,"" he said.  Blackface's dehumanizing history  In the early years of Hollywood, embracing brownface or blackface was common.   ""For [Trudeau] not to recognize the deep racism underlying this brownface imagery is quite revealing for me,"" Amin-Khan said. ""At one level it shows that Justin Trudeau's understanding about race and racism doesn't seem to have deep roots.""  But Rinaldo Walcott, a professor and director of the Women and Gender Studies Institute at the University of Toronto, said a distinction needs to be made between brownface and blackface.    ""Of course to brown up your face and to dress up as a fictional Arab is troubling and disconcerting,"" said Walcott, who specializes in studies of black culture.  But blackface has a long enduring deep history used to denigrate and dehumanize black people, he said.  ""And that's why it's really important to distinguish that history from the way in which white people have often imitated other people by using some of the same techniques but not with exactly the same kind of intent.""  Blacks, for example, were not allowed to appear in theatre, so many white men painted their faces black and recreated some of the worst racist stereotypes, Amin-Khan said.  They would use burnt cork or shoe polish to paint their skin black, leaving wide areas around the mouth that would variously be left uncovered or painted red or white to give the appearance of oversized lips, Philip Howard, assistant professor of integrated studies in education at McGill University in Montreal, wrote in a piece for The Conversation titled The problem with blackface.  ""Once in blackface, minstrels would use exaggerated accents, malapropisms, awkward movements and garish attire to further ridicule black people,"" he wrote.    It became a popular form of racist entertainment in the U.S. in the 1820s with the first minstrel shows, Howard wrote. But it also was popular in Canada. Indeed, Quebec musician Calixa Lavallée, composer of the Canadian national anthem, O Canada, travelled as a blackface minstrel.   While the blackface minstrelsy endured into the mid-1900s, performances continued in other forms, and were found on university campuses or during Halloween or other events.  In 2011, for example, a group of white business students at the University de Montreal decide to pay ""tribute"" to Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt by painting themselves black. In 2014, students at Brock University in St. Catharines, Ont.,, according to the Toronto Star, ""won a campus pub Halloween contest ... after they wore blackface to dress as the Jamaican bobsled team.""  As Howard notes, today's blackface wearers may claim they don't believe in the biological inferiority of black people, but wearing the dark makeup ""is evidence of their ongoing, racist over-assessment of the significance of skin colour differences. In this way, blackface is dehumanizing.  ""The very need to use garish makeup as part of the process of portraying black people reveals an attempt to establish an essential difference between black and white people,"" he wrote.",politics
171,New SNL cast member Shane Gillis dropped over racist comments,"Saturday Night Live has rescinded its invitation to a new cast member who posted a video last year in which he used a racial slur for Chinese people and derided Asians trying to learn English.  A show representative said Monday that the language Shane Gillis used was ""offensive, hurtful and unacceptable,"" and the show was not aware of the past remarks that have drawn criticism.  Saturday Night Live apologized, saying it's vetting process ""was not up to our standard.""  In a tweet, Gillis said he respected the show's decision and is ""honestly grateful for the opportunity."" He said he had hoped to have the opportunity to prove himself, but ""I understand it would be too much of a distraction."" He ended with a slight swipe at the show, mentioning that he was always a Mad TV guy anyway.  In the clip of video apparently posted in 2018, Gillis refers to an unidentified city's Chinatown as being ""nuts"" and used a derogatory word for Chinese people. He also complained about ""hearing an Asian trying to learn English.""  The representative said the show hired Gillis ""on the strength of his talent as a comedian and his impressive audition for SNL.""    The clip of Gillis re-emerged last week just hours after NBC said that he and two others, including the show's only Asian American performer, were joining the cast as featured players.  Saturday Night Live has taken heat over the years for an overall lack of ethnic diversity, with scant Asian representation among its cast members or hosts.  Former members Fred Armisen and Rob Schneider both are one-quarter Asian, but neither has been widely recognized for their Asian ancestry. Among hosts, the long history of SNL includes a short list of Asian or Asian Americans, with Canadian-born Sandra Oh, Awkwafina and Jackie Chan among them.",entertainment
172,David Suzuki on the global youth climate movement,"Last Friday, millions of people turned out for climate strikes across the globe. In Halifax, young protesters held a rally and staged a die-in to draw attention to the issue and demand change from politicians.  With young people leading the global climate movement, environmentalist David Suzuki and former diplomat Stephen Lewis hope that means they'll turn out to vote in the upcoming federal election. Suzuki and Lewis are in Halifax for an event called the Climate First Tour.  Suzuki spoke with Portia Clark from CBC Nova Scotia's Information Morning about young people carrying the burden of advocating for change, and why it's a more critical time than ever for young people to vote.  Their conversation has been edited for clarity and length.  What did you make of those images of Friday's protests?  I'm humiliated that children have to be the ones now carrying the weight of this issue. This isn't what children should be doing. They shouldn't have to be worrying about the kind of world they're going to grow up in.    There's a poll out today saying that fewer Canadians trust science. How have we landed in this position?  That is a very sad indictment of, in many ways, media. But also, I think it's a reflection of the fact that the fossil fuel industry has spent billions of dollars in a campaign of disinformation for over 30 years now.  I think in the process, scientists have suffered in terms of public trust. We're in this terrible situation, but the reality is the science is impeccable. It's gotten stronger and stronger and the children are now telling us we've got to do something.    So you don't want the children to stop what they're doing, but you want other people to pick up the mantle.  Absolutely right, I'm grateful to it. But as an adult who was part of the whole generation that really didn't pay attention to it, it's very sad that they're having to do that.  Greta [Thunberg] has had an impact more than all the other environmentalists in the world put together. Just a child, the innocence of her message, she cuts through it all. She's telling politicians, ""Don't tell me you're protecting my future. Don't tell me to go back to school and stop worrying. I want you to worry. I want you to do something."" And it's very powerful.  What new commitments are you hoping to get out of politicians?  This is no longer a partisan issue. When Japan attacked Pearl Harbor and … Roosevelt declared war, no one saw it as a Democratu002FRepublican issue. They were united to win this battle.  Well, we're now in a battle over emissions and we've all got to come together. It's outrageous that any political party would actually deny the reality of climate change or even its importance.     What we're trying to do now is get young people out to vote. The 18 to 22 year olds, it's their future. That's really at stake. Go to all candidates meetings, and ask their position on climate. We've got to drive it onto the political agenda as a non-partisan issue. It's time to come together.  MORE TOP STORIES:",technology
173,Battle of the Blades is back and there are going to be bruises,"Battle of the Blades is back and ready to entertain Canadian audiences with its strange hybrid of two of the country's best loved sports: hockey and figure skating.  The popular reality TV show makes its return to CBC-TV on Thursday night after a six-year hiatus, once again pairing hockey players with figure skaters to see who can perform the best on-ice routine.  This season the show airs live in front of an audience at rinks in Hamilton, Mississauga, Oshawa and Toronto as the pairs compete for a $100,000 donation to the charities of their choice.   Since the duos are judged on their skills and grace, the hockey players have the biggest adjustment.    The show's title is apt since hockey players have to battle with wearing figure skates, which includes the toe pick (a set of jagged teeth at the front of the blade) that can cause a skater to suddenly fall forward if they're not careful.  ""The first day I got here about five minutes and then went down,"" said Bruno Gervais, who played defence for the New York Islanders.   ""I got a black and blue elbow. I got a chipped tooth. I got a sprained wrist, black and blue knees. It's all part of it.""    This year, two of the seven pairs feature female hockey players matched with male figure skaters: Amanda Kessel, who won a gold medal with Team USA at the last Winter Olympics, and her Team Canada rival Natalie Spooner.  ""In hockey it doesn't matter what you look like just as long as you get the job done and you score some goals — you put the puck in the net, you can be as ugly a skater as you want,"" said Natalie Spooner, who won an Olympics Gold medal and the Clarkson Cup championship in 2014.  ""Then you come to figure skating and it's really all about pointing your toes, your shoulders back, smiling.""    Spooner points out that she's bigger than most female figure skaters, an added challenge for her partner, ice dancing champion Andrew Poje who has to lift her in the air.  ""I don't think little girls have probably seen a figure skater quite as big as me, so hopefully it shows them that they can do anything that they put their mind to and want to do.""    This season's cast of male hockey players includes former ""enforcers"" Colton Orr and Brian McGrattan, who fought each other 10 times during their NHL careers.   ""I think most of the hockey guys would like to prove that we can do other things than what we've done on the ice,"" said McGratton, a towering six foot four inch former winger who played for several teams including the Calgary Flames. ""Show off our skills, our smooth skating abilities and grace.""  Another ""tough guy,"" P.J. Stock, was brought in as a late replacement for Colby Armstrong, who sustained a hamstring injury during rehearsals. Armstrong will appear as a guest judge alongside other rotating guest judges, who include Canadian ice dancing champions Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir, and head judge Kurt Browning.  Stock is paired with Violetta Afanasieva, who was his Battle of the Blades partner on season two of the show.   The type of male hockey players who come on Battle of the Blades are the ones who are used to taking risks to be part of a team, according to Stock.  ""Some of the other guys, they're a little concerned sometimes about the image that you could possibly get by falling on national television in figure skates,"" he said.     Another of this year's competitors is Sheldon Kennedy, who has been a spokesperson for victims of child abuse, after his junior hockey coach was charged with sexual assault for the abuse he suffered as a teenager.  He said being out of his comfort zone by wearing figure skates instead of hockey skates doesn't faze him.  ""Sadly, for a lot of time in my life I've been out of my comfort zone,"" he said.  Kennedy — who is paired with figure skater Kaitlyn Weaver — welcomes the opportunity that Battle of the Blades will bring him, and others.   ""I spent a lot of years in that dark place, and we've done a lot of work around trying to prepare and set things up systematically to allow people to get out of that dark place and now we need to show it. And to me this is the reality: we can have fun, there is a way out and this is about hope.   ""And that's what we're skating for: to show people that there's hope. And to smile again.""  Battle of the Blades premieres Thursday, September 19 at 8 p.m. (8:30 NT) on CBC and the free CBC Gem streaming service.",entertainment
174,Court of appeal tells B.C. to reconsider Trans Mountain environmental conditions,"The B.C. Court of Appeal has instructed the province to reconsider its environmental assessment certificate and conditions issued for the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project.  In their challenges, the Squamish Nation and the City of Vancouver argued the certificate should be quashed because it was based on a flawed report and approval from the National Energy Board that was later quashed by the Federal Court of Appeal.   After the National Energy Board reviewed the project for a second time, the federal government again approved the $7.4-billion expansion of the pipeline that runs from Alberta to the B.C. coast.  The B.C. Court of Appeal did not opt to quash the provincial certificate and instead said it's ""remitting"" it back to the province to reconsider, ""in light of the changes in the National Energy Board's report.""  The court ruled against the parties on the other argument put forward regarding duty to consult. The court found that the province met its duty to consult with the Squamish Nation on the project.  The question of consultation is still before the courts at the federal level and the legal actions include several B.C. First Nations.     In its 2017 certificate for the project B.C. placed 37 conditions on Trans Mountain — conditions that are beyond the 156 placed on the Crown corporation by the National Energy Board. It will be up to the province now to decide how it reviews those conditions and if amendments or additions are made.  Squamish spokesperson calls on B.C. to 'respect Indigenous rights'  Reacting to the court's decision on Tuesday, Squamish Nation spokesperson Khelsilem called on the province to put its words about reconciliation into action.   ""Premier Horgan and his government need to set the bar higher and rethink their approach to the TMX Project, and truly respect Indigenous rights by jointly reviewing with the Squamish Nation and other concerned First Nations whose territories would be directly impacted by the pipeline expansion,"" he wrote in a statement.     The City of Vancouver said in an emailed statement that it's pleased to see the court partially allowed its challenge to the certificate.   ""The City remains of the view that the Trans Mountain Pipeline project would have significant environmental impacts, including the unacceptable risk of oil spills and increased greenhouse gas emissions related to the project at a time when the world needs to reduce emissions,"" a spokesperson wrote.   Eugene Kung, a lawyer with West Coast Environmental Law who has been involved in several challenges to the pipeline expansion, said it's unclear what changes will result from this decision. He said that if B.C. amends or adds to the conditions in its certificate, it could have an impact on things like construction permitting.   ""B.C. now has an opportunity to put in place some protections for the province that they have been so vocal about... as long as those are within provincial jurisdiction and related to some of the new information provided by the NEB in the reconsideration, I think all of that is fair game,"" Kung said.   B.C. says it will 'take every measure available' in response to decision   B.C. Minister of Environment George Heyman said the decision is still being studied but that the provincial government remains committed to ""take every measure available to us to protect B.C.'s interests.""  Heyman said any amendments or additions to the conditions in its environmental assessment certificate will happen in consultation with Indigenous groups.   ""That is our constitutional legal duty and one of course we take seriously, given our commitment to the U.N. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples,"" he said.    In an emailed statement, Trans Mountain said the current certificate remains in place and that it is continuing with construction and planning of the expansion and is committed to building it ""in a manner that minimizes impacts to the environment and respects the values and priorities of Canadians.""  ""The court invited the B.C. government to review the [NEB report] amendments ... to determine whether they impact the provincial conditions that are placed on the project. The court affirmed the province is limited to making adjustments or additions to the provincial marine conditions and must do so within the limited scope of provincial authority over marine issues.""",business
175,"From book to ballet: Anne of Green Gables ballet set to tour Canada, U.S.","L.M. Montgomery's Anne of Green Gables was published in 1908 and was an immediate critical and commercial success. Over the past 111 years, it's been a cultural touchstone both at home in Canada and around the world.  The novel has been adapted numerous times — Canadians who grew up in the 1980s and 1990s will remember Megan Follows's turn as the iconic red-headed orphan. Prince Edward Island has been running a musical version for a staggering 55 consecutive summers. CBC's own Anne with an E begins its third season on Sept. 22, 2019.     Watch Anne with an E on CBC Gem    Now, for the first time ever, Anne of Green Gables is being adapted into a full-length ballet by Canada's Ballet Jörgen.    Turning Anne into a ballet  Anne of Green Gables is the story of an orphan who comes to live with siblings Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert in the fictional town of Avonlea in Prince Edward Island. An unusually outspoken and poetic girl, Anne is, at first, unwelcome in the quiet community. But the very traits that paint her as an outcast eventually win the town over.  Ballet Jörgen spent three years securing the rights to mount their own adaptation.  Except for a one-act version staged by the Royal Winnipeg Ballet in 1989, this marks the ballet debut of Anne of Green Gables.  ""Anne is a very vivacious character and it lends itself very well to dance,"" said Bengt Jörgen, company founder and choreographer. ""You'd be hard-pressed to find a better character to put into dance.""      Anne is a very vivacious character and it lends itself very well to dance.  - Bengt Jörgen, choreographer     Turning Anne Shirley into a dancer is what Hannah Mae Cruddas has been working on for months. The Nova Scotia dancer read the books as an eight-year-old and has been in love with the story ever since.  ""I reread it and dog-eared all the pages where L.M. Montgomery talks about the physicality of Anne… the way she holds her body,"" said Cruddas.  ""There are a few moments where they talk about Anne clasping her hands in front of her or lifting her eyes skyward. I can use those moments from the book in my movement. That was my research.""    Cruddas isn't the only cast member who discovered the book as a kid. Hiroto Saito, who is working on the roles of Matthew Cuthbert and Mr. Phillips, remembers reading the story growing up in Japan. His mother is such a huge fan of the books that she will be making the trip from Japan to Halifax to attend the show's premiere on Sept. 28.  ""It's a little different than a classical ballet because the characters are fairly young, so the movement is a little more energetic and explosive. It's very unique and it's quite exciting to see what's going on. I can't wait to see the final result,"" said Saito.     Love Anne with an E? The cast and showrunner have some book recommendations!    The famous scene    One of the most memorable moments from the book — and all its subsequent retellings — is the moment Anne loses her temper and smashes a slate over the head of Gilbert Blythe.  It's the beginning of a feud that will simmer for the rest of the story. The scene also serves as a benchmark for how much room Anne and Gilbert have to grow as characters.  In the novel, it's a comedic moment as much as a powerful one, and that's how Ballet Jörgen has chosen to approach it as well.  Daniel Da Silva is playing Gilbert Blythe and so far doesn't mind getting hit in the head over and over again.  ""Those kinds of scenes are really hard to do because the timing is really important,"" said Da Silva, who grew up in São Paulo, Brazil.  ""If it's not quite right with the music or if I flinch before the slate hits me in the head, it doesn't work.""     75 facts you might not know about Anne of Green Gables and Lucy Maud Montgomery    The biggest tour to date  Ballet Jörgen, whose mandate is to ""tell Canadian stories,"" is comprised of young dancers from Canada, Brazil, Japan, Mexico, the U.S. and the U.K. The cast of Anne of Green Gables features 20 dancers, all of whom will play multiple roles.  Jörgen, along with stage director Heinar Piller and set and costume designer Sue Lepage, have created 22 dance scenes to tell a 342-page story.  Orchestrator Alexander Levkovich adapted Norman Campbell's score from Anne of Green Gables – The Musical™ for the ballet.    The company's tour will bring them to small towns and cities across Canada and the U.S. It's already their biggest tour ever, with plans to extend it to 2021.

176,Toronto Public Health calling on province to end non-medical exemptions for vaccines in schools,"Toronto's medical officer of health is calling on the province to stop allowing children in Ontario schools to skip vaccines for non-medical reasons — but so far, Premier Doug Ford's government doesn't plan on changing the approach.  In a new report released on Monday, Dr. Eileen de Villa recommends Health Minister Christine Elliott consider changing the Immunization of School Pupils Act to only accept medical exemptions from a certified health-care provider.  ""Before philosophical and religious exemption rates reach dangerously high levels in Toronto, it is important and timely for the provincial Ministry of Health to consider removing philosophical and religious exemptions from its legislation,"" de Villa wrote in the report.  It's a controversial suggestion that comes against a backdrop of plummeting vaccination rates in areas around the world and instances of disease outbreaks in cities across Canada and the United States.  For Toronto students, there has been steady increase in philosophical and religious exemptions over the last decade and a bit, de Villa notes. Those increased from 0.8 per cent for the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine in the 2006 to 2007 school year to 1.72 per cent last year.  The rising non-medical exemption rates elsewhere have led to major outbreaks of multiple vaccine-preventable diseases such as whooping cough and measles.       Several outbreaks have been reported in Canada throughout 2019, including a measles outbreak in the Montreal area in June.  And in the U.S., more than 1,200 cases of measles have been confirmed in 31 states this year alone, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) — the highest number of cases reported in the U.S. since 1992.  ""The majority of cases are among people who were not vaccinated against measles,"" the CDC noted.  Amid that outbreak, New York State eliminated the area's religious exemption to vaccine requirements for schoolchildren earlier this year, with Democratic Sen. Brad Hoylman calling the situation an ""unprecedented public health crisis.""  'No plans' to update approach: health ministry  Toronto's board of health chair Joe Cressy said de Villa's recommendations are meant to be proactive.  ""This is based on science, and it's based on population health,"" he said. ""A lot of people are at risk if we don't have herd immunity.""      But a spokesperson for Elliott's office said there are ""no plans"" to update the province's approach.  Currently, under the Immunization of School Pupils Act, children are required to have proof of immunization for certain diseases to attend school in Ontario, unless there is a ""valid medical exemption or affidavit of conscience or religious belief,"" the health ministry's Travis Kann noted in a statement.  Pushback to that policy has been rising in recent years.    In 2016, the Canadian Medical Association passed a motion to back the end of non-medical exemptions in Ontario and the other two Canadian provinces — Manitoba and New Brunswick — which have similar mandatory vaccination laws for schoolchildren.  Other provinces and territories leave those decisions up to individual schools or school boards.  Ottawa-based physician Dr. Kumanan Wilson said public health teams should be guiding the discussion, but he stressed the complicated nature of changing the rules and suggested a limited policy — one that is re-evaluated later — could be the best interim approach for the province.  ""It's not a light undertaking to remove the ability of parents to make decisions regarding the health care of their children,"" Wilson said. ""However, if public health circumstances require it, sometimes these types of decisions need to be made.""  Kann said in Ontario, helping parents make ""informed"" choices is part of the process. Since 2017, parents have been required to complete an education session before submitting a request for a non-medical exemption.      De Villa agrees education is crucial.   ""Vaccine hesitancy, the reluctance or refusal to vaccinate despite the availability of vaccines, is a growing concern in Canada,"" she wrote in the report. ""It stems, in large part, from misinformation about vaccines that spreads on social media platforms and the Internet.""  Her other recommendations include calling for major online media companies — including Facebook, Google and Twitter — to better regulate vaccine misinformation.  De Villa is also calling on the board of health to request all Toronto school boards and the Ministry of Education to adopt curriculum on vaccines and vaccine-preventable diseases for all elementary schools.  Her recommendations will be considered by the board on Sept. 23.",health
177,"Proposed settlement with U.S. opioid-maker should include Canadian claims, B.C. government says","The British Columbia government says any proposed settlement from opioid manufacturer Purdue Pharma needs to include Canadian claims for the devastation created by the overdose crisis.  Purdue, the maker of the pain drug OxyContin, has filed for bankruptcy in the United States and proposed a multibillion-dollar plan to settle with thousands of state and local governments.  B.C. Attorney General David Eby said Monday the province has been monitoring the developments, including a tentative agreement that proposes to resolve the claims with Purdue, which is owned by the Sackler family.  Purdue Pharma Canada says in a statement it is a separate company from the U.S. firm and the actions taken to settle litigation in America don't directly affect its business in Canada.    Eby said the province remains ""ready and willing'' to participate in the effort to achieve a resolution but if B.C. is not included in the process then the government will continue its lawsuit, which names Purdue and several other opioid makers as defendants.  ""To date there has been no effort on the part of Purdue entities and the Sacklers to involve Canadian jurisdictions in the discussions that have led to the rumoured settlement in the U.S.,'' Eby said in a statement.    The province filed a proposed class-action lawsuit a year ago alleging drug manufactures falsely marketed opioids as less addictive than other pain medicines, triggering an overdose crisis that has killed thousands.  None of the allegations have been tested in court.    A statement of defence from Purdue Pharma could not be found on the B.C. Supreme Court website on Monday. Purdue Pharma has previously said that it followed all of Health Canada's regulations, including those governing marketing, and it's very concerned about the opioid crisis in B.C. and across Canada.  The pharmaceutical giant filed for bankruptcy late Sunday, step one in a plan it says would provide $10-$12 billion US to help reimburse state and local governments over overdose deaths.  The plan calls for turning Purdue into a ""public benefit trust'' that would continue selling opioids but hand its profits over to those who have sued the company. The Sackler family would give up ownership of Purdue and contribute at least $3 billion toward the settlement.    It will be up to a federal bankruptcy judge to decide whether to approve or reject the settlement or seek modifications.  Two dozen states plus key lawyers who represent many of the 2,000-plus local governments suing the Connecticut-based company have signed on to the plan.  But other states have come out strongly against it, arguing that it won't provide as much money as promised.",health
178,Omega-3: The treatment in search of an illness makes a comeback,"This is an excerpt from Second Opinion, a weekly roundup of eclectic and under-the-radar health and medical science news emailed to subscribers every Saturday morning. If you haven't subscribed yet, you can do that by clicking here.    Chances are you or someone you know, at some point, has popped a few of those honey-yellow gel capsules containing omega-3 fatty acids — likely in the name of good heart health.  The nutritional benefits of eating fatty fish — such as salmon, mackerel or tuna — have long been known. And there are entire generations of people who have fond memories of downing spoonfuls of cod liver oil.  That faith in fish oils has certainly been healthy for the bottom line of producers of omega-3 supplements — a global market valued at $3 billion.  And the scientific study of the benefits of omega-3 supplements also seems like an industry in itself, with more than 3,000 clinical trials alone registered at the esteemed Cochrane Library, a collection of medical and health-care databases.  This body of research tests hypotheses that the anti-inflammatory benefits of omega-3 could be used to treat or prevent an incredibly wide range of conditions, including ADHD, breast cancer, heart disease, high cholesterol, HIV, diabetes (Types 1 and 2), Tourette's syndrome, suicide and mania.    But when teams of researchers scrutinize the most reliable of these studies and put them together — known as meta-analyses — they conclude the treatment potential of these supplements is minimal to nil. Or, in a few cases, inconclusive.  (Reducing the risk of preterm births is perhaps the exception.)  But the 10 per cent of Canadian adults who take an omega-3 supplement might feel some vindication after a new review of all these meta-analyses concludes omega-3 can further reduce the symptoms of depression when taken in conjunction with antidepressants.  'Wasting money' on supplements  This ""meta-analysis of meta-analyses"" of randomized controlled trials — published in the journal World Psychiatry — examined the efficacy of the most popular and promising nutritional supplements, such as vitamins B, D, E, zinc, omega-3, probiotics and magnesium.  All of these are supplements targeted in a scathing 2013 editorial published by high-profile medical researchers in the Annals of Internal Medicine, titled Enough Is Enough: Stop Wasting Money on Vitamin and Mineral Supplements.  And it's likely no surprise that most supplements didn't fare as well as omega-3, which had ""the most consistent evidence we found across all the different supplements,"" said study co-author Brendon Stubbs, of King's College London.  But how did Stubbs and his colleagues find a new treatment potential for omega-3, when past reviews didn't?  ""There's rapidly growing interest in the field … so the evidence is constantly evolving,"" said Stubbs, adding that his team reviewed the most up-to-date studies in the field.    But he also noted more research is needed to determine what exactly is at play when it comes to omega-3.  The last five years have seen a resurgence of interest in fish oils, largely in a specific fatty acid found in omega-3 — eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). University of Toronto nutrition sciences professor Richard Bazinet said this latest review has validated that emerging literature.  ""When they separated the studies out by the ones that use mostly EPA, they are the ones that seem to be showing promise or are working,"" he said. ""That's what the study is reconfirming.""    EPA's most exciting development came in January, when a five-year study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that heart patients who were taking a prescription form of EPA, along with their other medications, lowered their risk of a cardiovascular event, such as heart attack or stroke.  The manufacturers of omega-3 supplements were more than just cheering from the sidelines; they used the findings to promote their own products.  'War' over omega-3  ""It created a bit of a war because a lot of the supplement companies said, 'Hey, look what EPA does. Our product has EPA.' And the drug company turned around said 'No, no, no. We're a drug. We're FDA approved. You can't use our research to support your product,'"" said Bazinet.  The pharmaceutical company which produced the EPA-derived drug, Amarin, had a point. Its product wasn't straight-up EPA from omega-3 supplements that could be bought from your local store: it was a concentrated derivative of EPA.  Amarin took two supplement-makers to court and eventually settled.    So that's the catch, so to speak, with fish oils. It's likely these pure forms of EPA that are the future of omega-3 research, Bazinet said, and not necessarily over-the-counter supplements.  It's also worth noting that any benefit demonstrated by EPA — be it cardiovascular or psychological — has only happened when it's taken alongside conventional pharmaceutical drugs.  Still, omega-3 isn't likely to win over physicians who often find themselves deprescribing supplements for their patients.    Dr. Samir Sinha, a Toronto geriatrician, said omega-3 is one of the most popular supplements he's regularly telling his elderly patients they can stop taking.  ""When I tell them these haven't been shown to be helpful, a lot of patients thank me,'' Sinha said. ""Because I say, 'By getting rid of all of these things, I've just saved you a bucket-load of money.'""  As for Bazinet, whose own nutrition research examines aspects of fish oils' effects on the brain, he also doesn't bother with omega-3 supplements, preferring to get his intake straight from the source.  ""I happen to walk by a fish shop every night on the way home,"" he said. ""[Sometimes] I enjoy a nice fish meal.""

179,Reaction to Trudeau's blackface runs from 'This can't be real' to 'I didn't really care' ,"Toronto resident Marcus Vanderwyck, a first-time voter, was set to walk into a voting booth next month and pencil an X beside the Liberal candidate in his Toronto riding, a show of support for Justin Trudeau.  But since the photos of the Liberal leader dressed in brownface and blackface emerged on Wednesday night, he has changed his mind.  ""It's changing my whole perspective,"" he said. ""I'm probably going to vote NDP.""    He learned about the pictures while on Instagram, saying that at first, he didn't believe what he was seeing.  ""I was like, this can't be real. Then it started getting into the news more and more and I was like 'Wow,  this is unbelievable'.""  'I really didn't care'  But not everyone interviewed by CBC News in St. James Town in Toronto shared Vanderwyck's views.   ""Personally for me, I really didn't care,"" said Lance Manning,  who works in the area but lives in Brampton. ""Some of my friends were really offended, but when it comes to my mindset, I focus on intent. How he dressed, was there any malicious thought behind it? And my conclusion is, that it isn't.""    Trudeau has publicly apologized twice since three pictures and a video of him in either brownface or blackface have come to light.  On Wednesday night, Time magazine published an article showing Trudeau wearing brownface makeup and a turban for a 2001 Arabian Nights gala at the Vancouver private school where he taught. Since then, CBC News obtained another photo of Trudeau from that event.  Meanwhile, another picture shows Trudeau at a talent show when he was in high school, wearing black makeup and singing the Banana Boat Song (Day-O), a Jamaican folk tune made famous by black American singer Harry Belafonte   'Making things hard on himself'  Then, on Thursday, the Liberal Party confirmed Trudeau appeared in a short amateur video in blackface.  Manning hadn't seen that image of Trudeau, until shown it by CBC News.     ""Oh boy,"" he said, after studying the image. ""He's making things hard on himself. He definitely should be more mindful of that kind of stuff.""  While he's still undecided as to who he will vote for and has voted Liberal in the past, Manning said the pictures won't likely affect his decision.  ""I like the Liberal party, I like the Trudeau family. His father did a lot for the black community and immigrants migrating to Canada, so I take all that stuff into consideration.  ""Will do more researching, but I'm always open to forgiving. People make mistakes in life.""    Muhammad Suhail, shown the pictures for the first time, said he couldn't understand why they had generated so much controversy and condemnation.  ""Why are people upset from that? Maybe he was trying to play, like an actor on stage. I'm OK with that.""  Bhavani Mohanadhas also said that she believes Trudeau is a ""good Liberal"" and that she doesn't feel he's ""doing any racism"".  I have been following [him]. He is everywhere supporting other people, different races.""     Brooks Smith said he was surprised by Trudeau's past behaviour, calling it ""a little disgracing.""  ""That really hurts, that really hurt, because I'm black. And you'd think he''d have more sense than that. You'd think he'd be a little smarter than that.""  Still vote for Trudeau  But Smith said he will still vote for Trudeau, that people make mistakes when they're younger.   ""If this were recently, I'd feel more against him.""    However, Andrew Ravindran wasn't as forgiving, saying that when he learned the news from Facebook, it was an ""Are you kidding me?"" moment.   He said he believes many people continue to dress in ""Arabian Night"" or Aladdin costumes.     It's really annoying,""he said.  ""I 'm brown so it's a little hard to be used to it. It's just stupid.""  Ravindran said he believes Trudeau has likely learned his lesson, but should have known better.  Asked to explain why he found Trudeau's brownface costume so offensive, Ravindran gave a succinct answer:   ""He's not brown.""",politics
180,Conservative riding association takes down fake meme of Rick Mercer endorsing party,"A Facebook post by a Conservative riding association in British Columbia spreading disinformation about Canadian comedian Rick Mercer has been removed.  The meme took an authentic Mercer quote about the importance of voting, but changed the final part of the quote from ""Vote"" to ""Vote Conservative.""  If the intent of the post was to trick people into believing Mercer was rooting for the party's candidate in Burnaby North—Seymour, it might have worked on some voters. But if the goal was to make Mercer laugh, it definitely worked.  ""It's completely bizarre,"" he told CBC News on Tuesday evening. ""I'm not angry. I was more amused than anything.""  Mercer took to Twitter to ask the party to remove the post. As of Tuesday evening, it was no longer showing on the Burnaby North Seymour Conservative Constituency Association page.  Before it was deleted, the caption on the post said ""wise words.""    Mercer said he was alerted to it by some friends and other people on social media who spotted the dishonesty in the quote.  ""I was always careful not to say, you know, which party you should vote for. I would never do that,"" Mercer said in an interview. ""It's weird that people will think in this day and age that you can get away with that.""  In a federal campaign where people have gotten in trouble for far more controversial social media posts, Mercer said he's not upset about it and he doesn't expect a response from Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, or anyone else for that matter.      I don't know what I'd be doing weighing into the local politics in Burnaby.  - Rick Mercer     He's just left scratching his head about who thought it would be a good idea to manipulate his quote.  ""There's a lot of very odd people running in this election for all the parties. I mean that's what you've gotta ask yourself, like what kind of person does that? It's just a very strange thing to do.""  It's especially strange given the fact he's from St. John's, on the opposite end of the country.  ""I don't know what I'd be doing weighing into the local politics in Burnaby, British Columbia.""  Heather Leung is the Conservative candidate for the riding. She's going up against Liberal Terry Beech, the Green Party's Amita Kuttner, New Democrat Svend Robinson and People's Party of Canada candidate Rocky Dong.

181,Millions in 150 countries protest for climate action,"Millions were taking to the streets in roughly 150 countries around the world on Friday for a global strike demanding world leaders gathering at a UN climate summit adopt urgent measures to avert an environmental catastrophe.  The protests kicked off in the Pacific islands — some of the nations most threatened by rising sea levels — and Australia, where social media posts showed huge demonstrations around the country, from the big coastal cities of Melbourne and Sydney to outback towns such as Alice Springs.   The worldwide strike was inspired by 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg.  Thunberg, who soared into prominence after sailing across the Atlantic in an emissions-free yacht ahead of the summit, was in New York to headline a massive rally in Lower Manhattan ahead of next week's climate summit at the headquarters of the United Nations.    The co-ordinated student ""strike"" culminated in New York's financial centre, Wall Street, where some investors have embraced the fossil fuel industry.  Massive crowds overwhelmed the streets of lower Manhattan, letting out roars of ""Save our planet,"" while anticipating an address by Thunberg.  ""Right now, we are the ones who are making a difference. If no one else will take action, then we will,"" Thunberg told demonstrators in New York.  ""We demand a safe future. Is that really too much to ask?"" she said.    New York City officials estimated that 60,000 people marched there.   Global climate campaign group 350.org said Friday afternoon that organizers estimated more than four million people had taken to the streets. About 3,000 companies closed their doors in support of the climate strikes, it said.  The protests, in advance of a UN summit Monday aimed at accelerating action to tackle global warming, kicked off a week in which more than 5,800 climate change-related strikes and other events are set to take place in 163 countries, 350.org said in a statement.  Britain's Opposition Leader Jeremy Corbyn tweeted that 100,000 people joined the demonstration in London.    ""Our future on your shoulders,"" read one banner stretched across a street by students in Berlin.    Protests extended beyond student-led demonstrations, with hundreds of Amazon workers walking out of their offices in Seattle, Wash. The employees held signs, some made from recycled Amazon boxes, that urged the company to stop dealing with oil and gas companies and to not make political contributions to people who deny climate change.  Amazon, which ships more than 10 billion items a year, vowed Thursday to cut its use of fossil fuels. It said it had ordered 100,000 electric vans to deliver packages beginning in 2021.  Employees of Google also participated in demonstrations, as about 60 gathered in downtown San Francisco and marched to join a larger, student-led climate strike in the city. One held a sign reading: ""Google Do Better.""     In Brazil, thousands mounted climate demonstrations of their own, largely aimed at President Jair Bolsonaro, whom they say is allowing fires to destroy the Amazon rainforest and worsen the environmental crisis. On Twitter, Brazilians tweeted #EleNao and #ForaSalles, calls to reject Bolsonaro and oust Environment Minister Ricardo Salles. Protesters criticized and mocked the two leaders with signs and costumes.  A few dozen people, mostly students, gathered on the steps of Rio de Janeiro's state assembly behind a banner reading ""climate justice.""  Global anxiety has focused on Brazil since August, when it was revealed fires in the Amazon have surged to their highest level since 2010. Many environmentalists blame Bolsonaro for policies they say favour development over environmental protections, and which have led to deforestation.  Salles told Reuters on Thursday that the majority of the Amazon remains intact, showing that Brazil is doing an ""excellent job"" to preserve the environment. He acknowledged the existence of manmade climate change, and said protesters are right to be concerned about the future.  ""I have children, and I am concerned about their future, too,"" he said in an interview.    In Europe, German Chancellor Angela Merkel unveiled a major new climate protection package thrashed out by parties in her coalition in all-night talks.  Meanwhile, on the streets of the capital, Berlin, crowds gathered at the Brandenburg Gate, where three activists stood on blocks of ice beneath a mock gallows.  ""A lot of people support our movement, but we want to go a step further, because politicians decide on our future,"" said Janik Oswald, a German spokesperson for Fridays for Future, the school strike movement started by Thunberg in Sweden last year. ""We urgently demand that something happens.""  'Not at all a nuisance,' Thai official says  The UN summit brings together world leaders to discuss climate change mitigation strategies, such as transitioning to renewable energy sources from fossil fuels.  The issue is vital to low-lying Pacific islands, which have repeatedly asked wealthier nations to do more to prevent rising sea levels.    Children in the Solomon Islands rallied on the shoreline wearing traditional grass skirts and carrying wooden shields in solidarity with the global movement.  In Thailand, more than 200 young people stormed into the Environment Ministry and dropped to the ground feigning death as they demanded government action on climate change.  ""This is what will happen if we don't stop climate change now,"" said 21-year-old strike organizer Nanticha Ocharoenchai.    The Thai Environment Ministry's deputy permanent secretary, Adisorn Noochdumrong, supported the students.  ""This is how the young people express their concerns, which we deem as a good sign and not at all a nuisance,"" he said.    In Palangka Raya, in Indonesia's Central Kalimantan province, youths carrying placards marched through heavy smog caused by forest fires.  In the eastern Indian city of Kolkata, around 25 school children handed out flyers at busy bus terminals and held placards that read ""Save Our Planet. Save Our World.""  ""This is the only planet we have. We wanted to stand for it before we went to school for the day,"" one of the children said.  'Chinese youth have their own methods'  Global warming caused by heat-trapping greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels has already led to droughts and heat waves, melting glaciers, rising sea levels and floods, scientists say.  Carbon emissions climbed to a record last year, despite a warning from the UN-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in October that output of the gases must be slashed over the next 12 years to stabilize the climate.    No protests were authorized in China, the world's biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions, but Zheng Xiaowen of the China Youth Climate Action Network said Chinese youth would take action one way or another.  ""Chinese youth have their own methods,"" she said. ""We also pay attention to the climate, and we are also thinking deeply, interacting, taking action, and so many people are very conscientious on this issue.""",technology
182,"Jeff Bezos makes climate pledge, after revealing Amazon emits as much carbon as a small nation","Online shopping giant Amazon revealed a carbon footprint Thursday that rivals that of a small country and CEO Jeff Bezos vowed to reduce the damage to the planet by cutting its use of fossil fuels.  The company, which ships more than 10 billion items a year on fuel-guzzling planes and trucks, said it has ordered 100,000 electric vans that will start delivering packages to shoppers' doorsteps in 2021. It also plans to have 100 per cent of its energy use come from solar panels and other renewable energy by 2030. That's up from 40 per cent today.  ""We've been in the middle of the herd on this issue and we want to move to the forefront,"" said Amazon founder Bezos. Bezos, who is also publisher of the Washington Post, made the climate pledge before the National Press Club in Washington.  The announcement came ahead of a walkout Friday by about 1,500 Amazon workers concerned over the company's impact on the climate. They are joining the Global Climate Strike, a worldwide climate change protest.  As much carbon as a small nation  Amazon said it emitted 44.4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide last year, a number that comes close to pollution rates of some small nations.  ""Its greenhouse gas emissions are about 85 per cent of the emissions of Switzerland or Denmark,"" said Gregg Marland, a professor at the Research Institute for Environment, Energy and Economics at Appalachian State University.    Amazon's employees have pressured the company to do more to combat climate change. Earlier this year, more than 8,000 Amazon staffers signed an open letter to Bezos, demanding that Amazon cut its carbon emissions, end its use of fossil fuels and stop working with oil companies who use Amazon's technology to find drillable oil faster.  Amazon plans to be carbon neutral by 2040 and wants other companies to join it. Bezos unveiled a climate pledge and said he would talk with CEOs of other large companies to get them to sign it.  ""We want to use our scale and our scope to lead the way,"" Bezos said.  Employees laud climate pledge  A climate change advocacy group founded by Amazon workers said the company's announcement amounted to a ""huge win"" and proved that employee pressure works. In a statement, Amazon Employees For Climate Justice said that it would keep pushing the issue as long as Amazon continues working with oil and gas companies and donating to politicians who deny climate change.  Bezos defended Amazon's work with the oil and gas industry, arguing that ""we need to help them instead of vilify them,"" and said Amazon would take a ""hard look"" at campaign contributions to climate deniers. However, he stopped short of saying such donations would stop.  Employees from other big tech giants, including Google and Microsoft, also planned to walk out on Friday. Their gripes mirror those of Amazon's employees, including that their companies provide technology to the oil industry. Ahead of the strikes, Google made its own announcement Thursday, saying it would buy enough renewable energy to spur the construction of millions of solar panels and hundreds of wind turbines across the world.  'Comprehensive' carbon accounting  To measure its carbon footprint, Amazon looked at emissions from all of its businesses, including the planes it operates and the energy it uses to make Echos, Kindles and its other devices. Amazon even included customers' trips to Whole Foods, the grocery chain it owns.  ""It's very comprehensive,"" said Beril Toktay, professor of operations and supply chain management at Georgia Tech's Scheller College of Business. She said she would like to see Amazon include the carbon footprint of the products it sells on its website, which could help drive people to shop for items that are less damaging to the environment.    Robin Bell, a research professor at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, said it was exciting to see Amazon taking meaningful steps to reduce its carbon footprint.  ""They're blazing a trail for other companies to follow suit,"" Bell said.",business
183,'We're ready for them:' Texans see opportunity in western Canadian malaise,"The brochure's cover has the Texas flag as a backdrop and shows an arrow pointing from Alberta to the Lone Star State.  ""Arrowstar Realty invites you to relocate to Texas,"" reads the mailer sent to businesses across Western Canada recently. ""Join the 100s of companies that have already made the move!""  Inside is a letter — beginning ""Dear Canadian Neighbour"" — boasting of Montgomery County's ""BOOMING"" economy, tax incentives and ranch-style properties. It offers to link prospective clients with banks, accountants and lawyers to ease their move.  Realtor Robert Graham says 15,000 brochures have been delivered in Alberta, Saskatchewan and British Columbia so far. Another 50,000 are coming.  40 companies in the past year and a half  He says Arrowstar has helped about 100 western Canadian companies move north of Houston in the last decade, and 40 of them were in the last year and a half.  The majority of newcomers have been Canadian oil and gas drillers.  ""I definitely want Canada to pick back up. I would love for that more than anything,"" says Graham.  But for now, he says, a lot of Canadian businesses need help to keep going.  ""We've got doors open and we're ready for them.""    Krisjan Jones, operations manager at livestock feed supplement maker Canadian Bio-Systems, says Lubbock's economic development agency recently made an enticing pitch to move his business to the west Texas city.  It was offering land at no cost with utilities and rail access.  ""So essentially you get a blank canvas for free,"" says Jones, who adds he's waiting on the outcome of the Oct. 21 federal election before pulling the trigger. He cites the federal carbon tax as a major issue for him.  Clogged railways that make it difficult to get international shipments out on time are another big knock against Canada, he says.  John Osborne with the Lubbock Economic Development Alliance says pitches are centred more on the long-term business case than politics or potential perks. When benefits are discussed, it's more of a problem-solving exercise.  ""We look at it as, 'What's stopping you from saying yes to coming to Lubbock right now?""'  Free land, road paving, sewer and water  That could mean free land, sewer and water hookups or road paving.  Osborne says his group has been doing Canadian outreach for about a decade, but it's gone from sporadic to regular in recent years.  Most trips are to Calgary and Toronto and have been with companies in oil and gas, manufacturing and agriculture.  Precision Drilling CEO Kevin Neveu moved to Houston from Calgary three years ago with the rest of the company's management team. It has about 250 employees in each city now.  Neveu says 2017 was the first year Canada made up less than half of Precision's activity and this year it's at 30 per cent.  Alberta's oil curtailments, trouble building new pipelines and cooling investor sentiment have depressed the Canadian industry, he says.  ""It's those three factors that are really starving our customers for capital, which means they're not reinvesting in drilling, which means that our business here is just really slow — brutally slow.""  Mark Scholz, head of the Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors, says every member he's spoken to has at least seriously considered moving people or equipment out of Canada.  The association represents more than 100 companies that drill or service oil and gas wells.  He says moves from Alberta's new United Conservative government to lessen the regulatory and tax burden are helping with competitiveness, but the southbound exodus is a wake-up call.  ""The Americans are playing a very strategic game and quite frankly I think they're winning at that.""",business
184,'This is really upsetting': Inconvenienced airline passengers struggle to get compensation under new rules,"Canada's new air passenger protection regulations promise up to $2,400 in compensation for customers denied boarding; however, some passengers have found that they need to do battle with their airline to collect their cash.   That was the case for Chelsea Williamson who finally got her denied boarding compensation from WestJet one week ago — only after complaining to the Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA).   ""[WestJet] called me, and they did say that they made a mistake,"" said Williamson, who lives in Edmonton. ""It stinks that they weren't willing to co-operate with me this way before I actually filed a complaint.""  The CTA reports it has received 147 passenger complaints concerning denied boarding issues since the new rules came into effect on July 15. Sixty-seven of the complaints involve Air Canada and 24 involve WestJet, while the rest are scattered among 27 other airlines.  Consumer advocate John Lawford said the complaints are inevitable, both because of airlines adjusting to the new rules, and what he believes is a reluctance among some carriers to embrace the regulations — which include hefty compensation for mishaps, such as lost baggage and flight delays.       It's early days, but I still see some reticence on the part of the airlines.  - John Lawford, executive director of Public Interest Advocacy Centre     ""It's early days, but I still see some reticence on the part of the airlines,"" said Lawford, executive director of the Public Interest Advocacy Centre.  'We failed to meet our obligations'  All the major Canadian airlines have told CBC News they intend to fully comply with the regulations.   But Williamson felt WestJet wasn't playing fair after she and her husband were bumped from their flight on July 22. Instead of receiving the $900 each in compensation they believed they were owed, the airline offered them $250 in travel vouchers.  The couple's journey began when they tried to board the first leg of their flight from Edmonton to Venice and were told that WestJet had switched the aircraft to a smaller one, so they had lost their confirmed seats.     ""We must have been at the bottom of their boarding priority list,"" said Williamson.   The newlyweds were on their honeymoon and, because they were put on a later flight, they arrived in Venice around five hours later than expected.    Under the new regulations, denied boarding passengers are entitled to $900 for a delay under six hours.  But when Williamson complained to WestJet by email and demanded compensation, she was told the couple didn't qualify because their rebooking was a pre-planned schedule change.   When Williamson argued that their ""schedule change"" occurred last-minute, the airline responded that it was actually classified as a flight delay or cancellation.      I was getting a different answer from WestJet every time I contacted them.  - Chelsea Williamson     ""I was getting a different answer from WestJet every time I contacted them.""  After filing the complaint, WestJet eventually paid Williamson and her husband $900 each and offered an apology.   ""Following an internal investigation, we recognized that we failed to meet our obligations to these guests,"" said spokesperson Morgan Bell in an email to CBC News.   Williamson's case has triggered a CTA investigation into whether WestJet's policies on flight changes comply with the new regulations. The airline said it's co-operating with the inquiry.     Show me the money  Marc Belanger of Prince George, B.C., also discovered collecting his compensation wasn't an easy process.   He and his wife were denied boarding on the first leg of their Air Canada flight from Prince George to Quebec City on July 19.  Because the plane was overbooked, and the two were put on a later flight — delaying their arrival by more than 13 hours — Air Canada promised them each $2,400 in compensation: the amount that must be paid when denied boarding passengers are delayed by more than nine hours.   ""I said, 'Oh, that's nice,'"" Belanger said.     But he began to lose faith when the money didn't materialize the following month. In mid-August, he said he complained by phone and by email to Air Canada, and when the cash still hadn't arrived by September, he contacted CBC News.  ""It's such a little amount of money for a company that size. I don't understand what the problem is,"" said Belanger. ""This is really upsetting.""  According to the new regulations, passengers must receive compensation within 48 hours of being denied boarding.      With any new regulations of such complexity it is only reasonable to expect that initially, in some cases, interpretation of the new rules and processing may sometimes take time.  - Peter Fitzpatrick, Air Canada spokesperson     Air Canada told CBC News that the compensation had been sent. Belanger did finally receive two cheques totalling  $4,800 on Monday — more than eight weeks after he and his wife were denied boarding.     ""I don't think it's acceptable,"" said Belanger, who believes that he may never have received the cash if he hadn't complained.  When asked about the delay in compensation, which contravenes the new rules, Air Canada responded that it's committed to full compliance, but that, inevitably, there'll be some hiccups as airlines adjust to the long list of regulations.   ""With any new regulations of such complexity it is only reasonable to expect that initially, in some cases, interpretation of the new rules and processing may sometimes take time,"" said spokesperson Peter Fitzpatrick, in an email.  More complaints to come?  Lawford believes the CTA will be swamped with complaints from passengers following the new regulations, the second part of which, covering delays and cancellations, take effect in mid-December.  To cope, he believes the agency needs to create a streamlined process to handle the deluge of unhappy passengers trying to collect their cash.  ""There has to be a very efficient, call-centre based, neutral section that does these complaints and is sitting there, waiting for them,"" Lawford said.",business
185,Justin Trudeau — a self-appointed moral steward in blackface: Robyn Urback,"It is almost too obvious now to point out the rank hypocrisy of the Trudeau brand: one that has zero tolerance for inappropriate touching, except for his own; one that preaches respect for Indigenous Canadians, except when you can get a cheap laugh at a Liberal fundraiser.   One that claims to run government differently, but uses the same old tactics to get its way; one that lectures about standing up to oppression, except oppression in certain ridings.   One that insists it is working in the interests of the average Canadian, but tries to curry favour with the above-average Canadian in private. One that renounces the politics of fear and division, except when the politics of fear and division can be politically advantageous.    And one that has spent its entire political existence proselytizing about tolerance, inclusivity, sensitivity and acceptance, all the while knowing — and hiding — a past that includes multiple instances of dressing up in blackface.   'Arabian Nights'  Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau made one good point while delivering his apology Wednesday, after Time magazine published a 2001 photo of him wearing brownface as a 29-year-old teacher at an Arabian Nights-themed school party.   ""If everyone who is going to be standing for office needs to demonstrate they've been perfect every step of their lives,"" Trudeau said, ""there is going to be a shortage of people running for office.""  Putting aside the enormous chasm between being ""perfect"" and wearing blackface three times, Trudeau makes a valid point about the need for a political machine that makes allowances for human flaws. If we don't allow people to grow and change, we end up with slates of sanitized candidates who planned their political careers from birth and wore suits to middle school, which is, without a doubt, a most hellish version of politics.   But Trudeau's argument would carry more weight had his war room not spent the week prior furiously digging up reasons why his opponents should be disqualified — reasons that include what they once said, once advocated for, or with whom they previously associated.  None of those claims were close to as bad as a grown man wearing blackface on multiple occasions. Had Trudeau been a regular candidate of any party, including the Liberals, he would've been closing up his campaign office by now.       Blackface scandal a 'painful' reminder of racism in Richmond, Va. — a city filled with reminders     Virginia's attorney general latest to admit to wearing blackface     Earlier this year, the United States was grappling with a political blackface scandal of its own: Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam was accused of wearing blackface in a 1984 yearbook photo.  That was the time, if ever, for Trudeau to own his actions, instead of being cornered into acknowledging them, as he has been now.  Instead, Trudeau carried on as if — to borrow his own words — he had been perfect every step of his life, with the Liberals then launching a co-ordinated attack on the Conservatives, accusing them of being soft on white supremacy.  Knowing what we know now, if you imagine Trudeau wearing black makeup and singing Day O while accusing Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer of refusing to take racism seriously, the attack loses its potency.     There is no question that the revelations of the last 24 hours are shocking, and that they could very well shift the direction of the federal election campaign.  But at the same time, for those familiar with the ways the karma gods of politics operate, they are wholly unsurprising, particularly considering the cracks in the Trudeau brand that have given way thus far.  It follows that the politician who preaches most about loving his wife probably loves his mistress more, and the one who rails against gay marriage would never do so in front of his secret male lover. The most sanctimonious of leaders are so often the sinners.   And Justin Trudeau is a perfect example: a self-appointed moral steward in a turban and dark makeup.  When you run on sanctimony, govern on arrogance and expect perfection, you find yourself in an awful quandary when you fall short of your own standards.  Each Canadian will decide for themselves whether Trudeau's actions — and failure to disclose those actions — warrant forgiveness. But his days as a progressive icon — the one who quipped ""Because it's 2015"" when asked why he prioritized gender parity in his cabinet, and boasted that ""Canada is back"" after his election — are over.   Trudeau truly has done some important, progressive things for Canada: from opening the door to those fleeing violence and persecution, to putting climate at the forefront of our national agenda (however lacklustre his actual policies might be). But from now on, Trudeau will never be able to separate his record from a few photos of him participating in a racist, ignorant, foolish act.   Maybe that's unfair.

186,'It's been a roller-coaster': Sask. nurse prepares for appeal after $26K penalty over Facebook post,"It's been a tough four years for Carolyn Strom.  In 2016, the Prince Albert, Sask., nurse was found guilty of professional misconduct by the Saskatchewan Registered Nurses Association after a 2015 post she made on Facebook, criticizing the health care her grandfather received.  She was ordered to pay a $1,000 fine and $25,000 to cover the cost of the tribunal.  ""It's been a roller-coaster,"" said Strom. ""It's been really stressful. I didn't ever imagine that it would go on this long.""  On Tuesday morning, Strom will be at the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in Regina to fight the association's decision as well as a provincial Court of Queen's Bench decision that ruled against her last year.   The professional charges stemmed from a February 2015 Facebook post in which Strom criticized the care her grandfather received while in palliative care at St. Joseph's Integrated Health Centre in the town of Macklin, about 225 kilometres west of Saskatoon.  ""It is evident that not everyone is 'up to speed' on how to approach end of life care ... or how to help maintain an aging senior's dignity (among other things!),"" read part of the Facebook post.  ""To those who made Grandpa's last year's less than desirable, please do better next time!""     Some of the nurses in the hospital felt Strom's post was a personal attack and complained. The SRNA ruled the post brought the nursing profession into disrepute and violated its social media policy.  Strom refused to drop the case and held to it as a matter of principle. She was ordered to write an essay explaining what she did wrong, and refused to do so.  She believes her case has had a chilling effect on other nurses speaking out across the province.  ""My fear is that things aren't getting reported. Things aren't changing,"" she said.   ""People are afraid to to address concerns, and that's not helping anybody, especially the people with family members that are in hospital.""  'Don't speak out'  The case generated public outrage, with many advocates speaking out on Strom's behalf.  ""If what she said is deemed by the regulator to be somehow crossing a line, then I think we're all in pretty deep trouble,"" said Steven Lewis, a Saskatoon-based health-care policy analyst.  ""They're essentially sending the message, 'Don't speak out on anything.'""    Several groups, including the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association and the Canadian Constitution Foundation, have received intervenor status in the case, testifying on Strom's behalf.    Lewis noted that Strom's comment did not single out any particular person, and was talking about the care her grandfather received in a facility hundreds of kilometres away, not her individual workplace.  ""If the message is that you can't criticize anything about the health-care system then, among other things, the public is deprived of an independent voice from within the profession,"" he said.   ""If we're seeing, as a blanket principle, that no person who works in health care should be able to say anything publicly in a general way about the quality of care, then I think society is in pretty big trouble.""  Public stain  However, the nurses association believes it's important that Strom be held to account.  In its court submission, the association said Strom should have taken any complaint through official channels and should never have talked about the situation in public.  ""Even though she did not name names, a reasonable person who read the [Facebook] post could easily come to the conclusion that the majority of the small number of nurses who work at this institution are incompetent, lack compassion and don't care about their patients,"" read the submission.  ""It is impossible for a person who works there to distance themselves from this stain.""  The court document also said Strom never brought her concerns up to staff at the health centre, and staff could only remember a handful of times she had ever attended the facility.  ""Do Canadians not care about professional reputations?"" it read. ""Is it not reprehensible to anyone to carelessly use your professional status to harm reputations without getting all the facts or following the proper channels?""  However, Strom's lawyer, Marcus Davies, said the legal challenge has far-reaching applications beyond his client's case, especially for anyone in a profession under professional regulations.  ""There are sort of professional implications here for all of us, whether you're a lawyer, doctor or a chartered accountant,"" he said. ""It's sort of an infringement on our rights by delegation.""   Davies said the Court of Queen's Bench judge erred when he wrote that a professional body's decision should trump the court.  ""We feel that in this case, a panel of nurses does not have the expertise in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms that the court has,"" he said. ""The court should have exercised its discretion to test that.""  The right balance  Keir Vallance, a law professor at the University of Saskatchewan, said courts have generally shown deference when it comes to rulings from professional bodies.  However, he also said the nurses association's decision could be seen as heavy-handed in this instance.  ""The interesting question is whether the regulator found the right balance between their power to regulate their members' speech versus the right of nurses to speak their minds.""  He said there's a good reason associations want to monitor what members say.  ""You don't want, as an example, nurses spreading health disinformation or undermining confidence in the health-care system without some good reason,"" he said.  ""The real question here is, did this particular regulator in this particular instance go too far? Did they go beyond what the public interest requires?""",health
187,"How hi-tech sensors on buildings, cars and in the sky could help keep Toronto's air clean","High tech ""super sniffers"" using next-generation sensing technology and high-powered data crunching could help Toronto track down sources of odour and pollution, according to experts at a conference on air quality this week.  Some of the new systems were on display at the third annual Air &amp; Odour Management Conference and Technology Showcase held at Hart House at the University of Toronto.  Recent U of T grad Omid Youssefi is a research and development engineer at Scentroid, a company that specializes in the manufacturing of odour sensing and analysis equipment. He says right now there are only a handful of monitoring stations sniffing Toronto's air. What's more, the air quality monitoring stations are typically large and expensive.   ""We need enough mobile stations that can be mounted on buildings or poles near schools or other locations of interest to measure the air quality and pollution levels in many locations,"" he said.  Youssefi envisions public-service vehicles, such as police cars, equipped with pollution sensors measuring the quality of the air as they patrol the streets and drones criss-crossing over the city sniffing the atmosphere.  Such a network could provide much-needed real-time data on the toxic cocktail of air pollutants such as carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and ozone. That would help provide a precise forecast about what's in the air we breathe in various areas of the city.    Youseffi says that kind of information could be used by people in their daily commute, which could help them choose different activities or locations during periods of high pollution.  ""Say you are bicycling down the road and you are breathing in lots of air and you want to know what's in the air,"" he said.    The World Health Organization estimates that air pollution contributes to the deaths of seven million people a year, and according health officials in Toronto, fatalities due to poor air quality number in the hundreds annually.   Stephanie Gower of Toronto Public Health says bad air quality can be dangerous to vulnerable populations, and typically children and the elderly bear the brunt of the effects.    ""In the city of Toronto, the latest figures we have is that air pollution contributes to 1,300 premature deaths and 3,500 hospitalizations each year,"" she said.   She says researchers need more sensors in more places providing data from around the city to find the causes.  ""I think of the end of the day, the better the evidence we have the more we have an understanding of what interventions will work the best in terms of improving air quality and improving health,"" she added.  While factories, waste treatment facilities and traffic gridlock are usually blamed for pollution and nuisance odours, Dr. Ardevan Bakhtari, president of Scentroid, says researchers have found new sources.     ""A lot of people associate the cannabis odour with when it's being consumed. But the growing of cannabis and the extraction of oil has a huge odour that is completely different,"" Bakhtari said.  ""It hasn't been really studied for health effects, but for sure it can have a negative impact on your enjoyment of such things as being outdoors.""    Dr. Marianne Hatzopoulou, a Canada Research Chair in Transportation and Air Quality, says it's important to understand what people are inhaling. But the leader of the Transportation and Air Quality research group at the U of T's Department of Civil &amp; Mineral Engineering says it can't be done without more data.  ""We need sensors and instruments that are able to penetrate within what we call urban micro environments into citizens' homes and into very small spaces, so that we can really understand what people are exposed to,"" she said.",technology
188,Canada banning Christian demonstrations? How a private member's bill sprouted fake news,"Imagine scrolling through Facebook when you come across this headline: ""Canada Moves to Ban Christians from Demonstrating in Public Under New Anti-Hate Proposal."" If you think it reads too shocking and absurd to be true, that's because it is.   But this exact headline appeared atop a story that was shared more than 16,000 times online since it was published in May, according to social media tool CrowdTangle. The federal government and Justin Trudeau, who is pictured in the story, are not seeking to ban Christians from demonstrating. In fact, the bill the story is based on was introduced in the Ontario legislature, by a Conservative MPP, and never made it past a second reading.   Incorrect and misleading content is common on social media, but it's not always obvious where it originates. To learn more, CBC News tracked this particular example back through time on social media to uncover where it came from and how it evolved over time.   March 20: Private member's bill introduced in Ontario  In this case, it all started with a bill. In March, Roman Baber, a freshman member of the Ontario provincial legislature introduced his very first private member's bill. Had he known how badly the bill would be misconstrued online, he might have chosen something else, he later told CBC News.   ""I expected that people would understand what prompted the bill, as a proud member of the Jewish community who's been subjected to repeated demonstrations at Queen's Park by certain groups that were clearly promoting hate,"" said Baber, Progressive Conservative member for York Centre.   The bill was simple. It sought to ban any demonstrations on the grounds of Queen's Park, where Ontario's provincial legislature is located, that promote hate speech or incite violence. Baber said the bill was prompted by previous demonstrations that occurred at the legislature grounds.    ""In 2017, we saw a demonstration that called for the shooting of Israelis. We saw a demonstration that called for a bus bombing and murder of innocent civilians,"" he said.   The bill went through two readings at Queen's Park and was punted to the standing committee on justice, where it's languished since.   March 27: Canadian Jewish News covers story  At first, the bill garnered modest attention online. The Canadian Jewish News ran a straight-forward report on the bill that included an interview with Baber shortly after he first introduced it. It was shared only a handful of times.    But a few weeks after the second reading, the bill drew the attention of LifeSiteNews, a socially-conservative website. The story was shared 212 times, according to CrowdTangle, including to the Yellow Vests Canada Facebook group.   In its story, LifeSiteNews suggested that a bill banning hate speech might be interpreted to include demonstrations like those that opposed updates to the province's sex education curriculum.  Baber said this isn't the case, because hate speech is already defined and interpreted by legal precedent.  ""The words 'hate' and 'hate-promoting' have been defined by the courts repeatedly through common law and is enforced in courts routinely,"" Baber said. ""So it would be a mistake to suggest that the bill expands the realm of hate speech.""  April 24: The Post Millennial invokes 'free speech' argument   But the idea stuck around. A few weeks later, on April 24, the Post Millennial posted a story labelled as news that argued the bill could infringe on free speech. The story was, however, clear that the bill was only in Ontario and had not yet moved beyond a second reading. It was shared over 200 times and drew nearly 400 interactions — likes, shares, comments and reactions — on social media, according to CrowdTangle.  May 6: Powerful emotions evoke response on social media   On May 6, a socially conservative women's group called Real Women of Canada published a news release on the bill calling it ""an attack on free speech."" In the release, the group argues that hate speech isn't clearly defined in Canadian law, and draws on unrelated examples to claim that Christian demonstrations, in particular, could be targeted.   For example, the group pointed to the case of British Columbia's Trinity Western University, a Christian post-secondary institution that used to require all students sign a covenant that prohibited sex outside of heterosexual marriage. A legal challenge around the covenant and a potential law school at Trinity Western occurred last year, but it had nothing to do with hate speech.   May 9: LifeSiteNews republishes news release  Though this news release itself was not widely shared, three days later it was republished by LifeSiteNews as an opinion piece. That post did better, drawing 5,500 shares and over 8,000 interactions, according to CrowdTangle It also embellished the release with a dramatic image and sensational headline: ""Ontario Bill Threatens to Criminalize Christian Speech as 'Hate.'""    At this point, the nugget of truth has been nearly entirely obscured by several layers of opinion and misrepresentation. For example, the bill doesn't specifically cite Christian speech, but this headline suggests it does.  These tactics are used to elicit a strong response from readers and encourage them to share, according to Samantha Bradshaw, a researcher on the Computational Propaganda project at Oxford University.  ""People like to consume this kind of content because it's very emotional, and it gets us feeling certain things: anger, frustration, anxiety, fear,"" Bradshaw said. ""These are all very powerful emotions that get people sharing and consuming content.""  May 11: Big League Politics publishes sensational inaccuracies   That framing on LifeSiteNews caught the attention of a major U.S. publication known for spreading conspiracy theories and misinformation: Big League Politics. On May 11, the site published a story that cited the LifeSiteNews story heavily.     The headline and image make it seem like Trudeau's government has introduced legislation that would specifically prohibit Christians from demonstrating anywhere in the country, a far cry from the truth.   While the story provides a few facts, like the fact the bill was introduced in Ontario, much of it is incorrect. For example, in the lead sentence, the writer claimed the bill would ""criminalize public displays by Christians deemed hateful to Muslims, the LGBT community and other victim groups designated by the left.""   The disinformation and alarmist headline proved successful: the Big League Politics version of the story was shared more than 16,000 times, drew more than 26,000 interactions and continued to circulate online for over two weeks.  This evolution is a common occurrence. Disinformation is often based on a nugget of truth that gets buried under layers of emotionally-charged language and opinion. Here, that nugget of truth was a private member's bill introduced in the Ontario legislature. But that fact was gradually churned through an online network of spin until it was unrecognizable in the final product.       At the end of the day, democracy is really hard work. It's up to us to put in that time and effort to fact check our information, to look at other sources, to look at the other side of the argument and to weigh and debate and discuss.  - Samantha Bradshaw, researcher at Oxford University     ""That is definitely something that we see often: taking little truths and stretching them, misreporting them or implementing commentary and treating someone's opinion about what happened as news,"" Bradshaw said. ""The incremental changes that we see in these stories and these narratives is something very typical of normal disinformation campaigns.""    Bradshaw said even though disinformation is only a small portion of the content online, it can have an outsized impact on our attention. With that in mind, she said it's partly up to readers to think critically about what they're reading and sharing online.   ""At the end of the day, democracy is really hard work,"" Bradshaw said. ""It's up to us to put in that time and effort to fact check our information, to look at other sources, to look at the other side of the argument and to weigh and debate and discuss.""

189,Here's what our ancient cousins the Denisovans looked like,"Scientists say they've deciphered features of the skull and some other details of a mysterious extinct cousin of Neanderthals by analyzing its DNA.  The genetic material came from the finger bone of a female member of the Denisovans, a population known mostly from small bone fragments and teeth recovered in Siberia's Denisova Cave.  Denisovans may have occupied that cave from more than 200,000 years ago to around 50,000 years ago. Recently, a Denisovan jaw fragment at least 16,000 years old was reported from in China. But that still gave scientists very little sign of what Denisovans looked like.  Modern-day people did not evolve from Denisovans or Neanderthals, although our species interbred with both and picked up genetic markers that are still detectable in some populations.  The new work used DNA data from two Neanderthals and five ancient and 55 present-day members of our own species, as well as five chimps, in addition to the Denisovan finger bone. Results were reported Thursday in the journal Cell by Liran Carmel of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and others.  They looked for differences in activity levels for specific genes that could affect anatomical traits, which in turn hinted at differences in appearance for those traits. They identified 32 traits that gave clues to the Denisovan skeleton.  As expected, most were shared with Neanderthals, including robust jaws, a low forehead, a large ribcage and a wide pelvis.    The analysis also indicated Denisovans had a wider face than Neanderthals and our own species, and a more protruding face than our own species but less so than Neanderthals, for example. The calculations could not tell how big such differences were.  Such DNA analysis can teach scientists about how our forerunners evolved and how their development differed, Carmel said in an email.  The method showed good accuracy in predicting known physical traits of Neanderthals and chimps, the researchers said. Carmel said the Denisovan jaw fossil matched the method's predictions ""almost perfectly.""  'Brilliant and original'  Experts not connected to the work were impressed.  While it's impossible to know how accurately the study estimated Denisovan traits, its approach is ""brilliant and original,"" said Benedikt Hallgrimsson, of the University of Calgary.  Once the appropriate fossils are found, the study's specific predictions can be tested, said Hallgrimsson, who studies evolutionary aspects of how genes influence physical traits in mammals.    Bence Viola of the University of Toronto, who studies Denisovan fossils, called the work ""a huge step forward.… This would have been called science fiction five years ago.""  The overall picture it gives of the anatomy is ""invaluable,"" although some details are probably incorrect, he said.  Viola said he was skeptical about an artist's renderings that added skin, eyes and hair to the skull produced by the study. Scientists don't know enough about Denisovans to ensure such renderings are accurate, he said.  Carmel, who commissioned the renderings, said they were as anatomically precise as possible but necessarily ""also represent some artistic interpretations.""",technology
190,"You're not trying hard enough on climate change, Greta Thunberg tells U.S. lawmakers","Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg offered a blunt message to Congress on Tuesday as she brought her campaign for urgent action on climate change to the U.S. Capitol.  ""I know you're trying,"" she told Democratic senators at an invitation-only forum, ""but just not hard enough. Sorry.""  Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey thanked the 16-year-old activist for her advice and her activism, which has gained worldwide attention by inspiring a series of protests and school strikes, including one set for Friday.  Thunberg and other young activists bring ""moral clarity"" to the fight against global warming, Markey said.  ""We hear you,"" he told her, vowing that lawmakers ""will redouble our efforts to make sure that we inject this issue into the politics of this building and this country because time is running out.""  Markey and other lawmakers hailed Thunberg as a ""superpower,"" noting that her activism has drawn a passionate following of children essentially challenging their elders to take action.  ""Save your praise,"" Thunberg replied. ""We don't want it,"" she added, especially if officials intend to talk about climate change ""without doing anything about it.""  Thunberg was in Washington ahead of a global strike planned for Friday. Activists are calling for immediate action from the world's governments to halt global warming, reduce fossil fuel consumption and avert environmental catastrophe.    Instead of listening to her and other teenagers, lawmakers should invite scientists to the Capitol to listen to their expertise on ways to slow a rise in global temperatures, Thunberg said.  ""This is not about us. This is not about youth activism,"" she said. ""We don't want to be heard. We want the science to be heard.""  Despite Thunberg's request, lawmakers bombarded her and other youth activists with praise, saying they had sparked a global movement that is already being felt in the 2020 presidential campaign and in the halls of Congress, where lawmakers are debating proposals such as the Green New Deal.  Markey is a co-sponsor of the Green New Deal, which would shift the U.S. economy away from fossil fuels such as oil and coal and replace them with renewable sources such as wind and solar power.  ""We need your leadership,"" he told Thunberg and other activists. ""It's creating a new X-factor"" to boost efforts to fight climate change.    Last month, Thunberg crossed the Atlantic Ocean in a solar-powered boat, landing in New York City on Aug. 28. She's in Washington for several days of rallies and lobbying efforts ahead of Friday's global climate strike.  Thunberg will testify before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday and address the U.N. Climate Action Summit in New York next week.",technology
191,Fed takes action to control short-term interest rates,"The U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of New York carried out $53 billion US in transactions known as repurchase agreements Tuesday as a way to relieve upward pressure on interest rates in overnight money markets.  Economists do not see the action as a signal about where the Fed plans to move its key policy rate, known as the federal funds rate, but rather as a technical exercise to keep the rate in the range set by the central bank.  The Fed is expected to cut this benchmark rate for a second time this year at its meeting this week.  The target for the funds rate, which is the interest rate banks pay each other for overnight loans, currently stands in a range of 2 per cent to 2.25 per cent after a quarter-point cut in July.  On Monday, the funds rate was trading at 2.25 per cent, at the top of its current range. In an effort to move it back into the current range of 2 per cent to 2.25 per cent, the New York Fed announced Monday it planned to conduct a repurchase operation for up to $75 billion on Tuesday morning.    The Fed's operation, which ended up being for $53 billion, was aimed at keeping the Fed's policy rate from trading outside of its range.  Analysts were not certain what had caused higher demands for repurchase agreements to push the trading range higher but said it did not seem to be signalling any fundamental problem with credit markets and could have been tied to an adverse reaction to a jump in oil prices after Saudi Arabia's production facilities were attacked over the weekend.  ""This is a technical exercise and has no implications for Fed policy at all,"" said economist David Jones, the author of four books on the Federal Reserve.",business
192,Hybrid-powered electric cruise ship navigates Northwest Passage ,"A Norwegian company says it has navigated the first hybrid-powered cruise ship through the Northwest Passage using a combination of massive batteries and diesel engines.  The company claims it's the first time a vessel of its kind and size has sailed the route.  Hurtigruten, a cargo, ferry and cruise company from Norway, designed MS Roald Amundsen.  The boat, which is named after Norway's famed polar explorer, completed a more than 3,000-nautical-mile voyage from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean, ending in Nome, Alaska, on Sept. 10. Nearly 500 people were on board.  ""No one even thought it was possible a couple of years ago, including all the biggest cruise lines in the world,"" said John Downey, president of Hurtigruten's American division, about building a hybrid electric-powered cruise ship.   ""This had never ever been implemented before ... we're very proud of her.""    The ship's hybrid technology involves four diesel engines and two large battery packs. Daily emissions from one single cruise ship can be equivalent to one million cars, said the company  The new system, combined with the design of the ship's hull, reduces the ship's emissions by about 20 per cent.  When the ship needs a boost of power, the captain has the option of drawing electricity from the battery packs rather than starting another engine, said Downey.  In some scenarios, like when observing wildlife, the ship can run solely off battery power for about an hour.  The ship also has energy recovery systems, such as using water that cooled engines to help heat the spa and pools. All grey water and waste is stored on board.    ""For this to be happening, it's really delighting to hear,"" said Pam Gross, mayor of Cambridge Bay, Nunavut. Located on the Dease Strait, the hamlet was one of the stops on MS Roald Amundsen's recent voyage.  ""[I] hope it sets a precedent for other ships that are coming through,"" she said.  The community is still weighing the pros and cons of having cruise ships come to town, Gross said.    A cruise ship went aground near Kugaaruk, Nunavut, in 2018. People are worried about emissions, pollution, oil spills and invasive species coming into their waters, said Gross.    ""You know we want to ensure that our waters are being protected and our precious ecosystems underwater.""    Hybrid technology a step in right direction  The Clean Arctic Alliance calls the hybrid technology a good step if it's viewed as a ""transition fuel"" until technology advances to renewable forms of propulsion.  Just under half of the ships in the Arctic still use heavy fuel. The non-profit is campaigning to ban the use of heavy fuel oil from shipping in the Arctic, reducing pollutants including black carbon — an accelerator of climate change — said the alliance.       It's not where we ultimately want to see shipping get to.  It's got to go even further.  - Sian Prior, Clean Arctic Alliance     ""It's a move in the right direction. But it's not where we ultimately want to see shipping get to. It's got to go even further,"" said Sian Prior, the alliance's lead adviser.   She said the industry is at least 10 years away from seeing battery-operated cruise ships.  Hurtigruten along with the Clean Arctic Alliance launched the Arctic Commitment in 2017 to phase out the use of heavy fuel in the Arctic.  ""We think it's completely unnecessary for cruise lines to use [heavy fuel oil]. There's lots of alternative available,"" said Downey.  The company is investing in designing liquid natural gas and biofuel engine supports into retrofitting current ships and future builds.  ""We're continuing to drive toward a point where ... we can eliminate carbon emissions all together. That is our ultimate goal, "" said Downey.",technology
193,Good faith or unfair attack? Saskatchewan appeal court to rule on nurse's Facebook posts ,"The nurse who was found guilty of professional misconduct over a Facebook post will soon learn whether she had the right to make those comments.  Three judges of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal reserved their decision Tuesday on the matter until a later date.  The court heard the Facebook post was made in good faith and was an exercise of her free speech.   Court also heard that the post may constitute fake news, although that wasn't discussed at a lower court hearing, and that there are no charter rights that protect unprofessional conduct.  Post violated social media policy  In 2015, Carolyn Strom wrote a post on Facebook criticizing the health care her grandfather received while in palliative care.   In the post, Strom said staff at St. Joseph's Integrated Health Centre in the town of Macklin, about 225 kilometres west of Saskatoon, needed to do a better job of looking after elderly patients.  ""It is evident that not everyone is 'up to speed' on how to approach end-of-life care ... or how to help maintain an aging senior's dignity (among other things!),"" read part of the Facebook post.  Some of the nurses in the hospital felt Strom's post was a personal attack and complained. The Saskatchewan Registered Nurses Association ruled the post brought the nursing profession into disrepute and violated its social media policy.  Strom was found guilty of professional misconduct and given a $1,000 fine by the association and was ordered to pay $25,000 in tribunal costs.   She appealed the ruling but her appeal was dismissed because the judge could find no reason to interfere with the association's decision, setting the stage for Tuesday's appeal hearing.  'Made in good faith'  On Tuesday, Strom's lawyer Marcus Davies argued her comments never mentioned nurses — just staff.  He said there were roughly 40 staff at the health centre, and it's hard to know specifically who Strom was referring to.   Davies also argued the comments were made in good faith, and that she exercised her right to free speech.  ""In the discipline committee, it says, 'It is accepted that Ms. Strom was not driven by malice,'"" Davies said. ""Well, that means her comments were made in good faith, if she was not driven by malice, then she was driven by good faith.""  The nurses association argued Strom should have gone through the correct channels and lodged an official complaint.   'Fake news'  Roger Lepage represented the Saskatchewan Registered Nurses Association at Tuesday's hearing.  He took the position that there is no charter right protecting unprofessional conduct and that there is no right for individuals to harm the reputation of other individuals.  Lepage argued that Canadians would be harmed if nurses would be able to say whatever they wanted about the health-care system.   He argued Strom's post qualifies ""fake news,"" but the judges presiding stated the previous hearing never found Strom's comments to be untrue, and said Lepage himself shut down that argument then.  Lepage argued Strom's post amounted to venting on social media and that other staff members ""had their hands tied"" by professional ethics.  Lepage also argued that Strom's post was not free speech or part of the public discourse, but rather an attack on an individualized group.  ""If you read her post, it's very personal, she's zeroing in on St. Joseph's, she's zeroing in on Macklin, she's zeroing in on identifiable people who work there, the staff,"" Lepage said.   ""That's what takes this out of the protection that Ms. Strom would ask of this court and was asking of the discipline committee.""  Lepage said that Strom should have filed a formal complaint with the Saskatchewan Health Authority, but didn't.  'I wish it didn't have to be this hard'  Strom spoke with reporters outside court on Tuesday, after the judges decided to reserve their decision.  When asked if she regretted making the posts on Facebook, Strom said she will always stand up for her family and she had no regrets about it.     ""What I don't think is fair is ... what this has turned into,"" Strom said. ""I didn't expect this… I wish it didn't have to be this hard.""  She said she was shocked to hear Lepage comment Canadians would be hurt if nurses were able to say what they want, when they want.   Strom responded to accusations that she was a liar and didn't have her facts right, made by the Saskatchewan Registered Nurses Association's legal representation, and said they were false.  ""I just cannot believe that, that was low, that was false, and I just don't understand how people get away with that,"" Strom said. ""There was absolutely no reason for that to have been said.""  Strom, who is working as a nurse part time in Prince Albert, Sask., said the court case has led her to question whether she wants to be a nurse.   Strom said she couldn't decide today whether she would carry on the case if the judges don't rule in her favour.  ""It will depend; every step is different and it gets harder every time, with respect to the toll that it takes to recover from all of this,"" she said. ""It's just so hard to stay composed when you're so involved.""  3 groups intervene  Three groups have applied for intervener status in the case, including the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association, the Saskatchewan Union of Nurses and the Canadian Constitution Foundation.  The Saskatchewan Union of Nurses (SUN), represented by Ronni Nordal, was the first group to speak on behalf of the interveners.  SUN argued the post was directed specifically at the St. Joseph's Integrated Health Centre, not at the nurses generally.     SUN argued there was no factual basis for which a finding of professional misconduct could be found.  SUN also argued that one of Saskatchewan Registered Nurses Association's statutory mandates is to promote the standing of the registered nurse professionally, not to defend or protect individual nurses, and the organization's argument was not rationally connected to its mandate.  The B.C. Civil Liberties Association, represented by Greg Fingas, argued the informal nature of social media meant that speech should not be compared to a letter from a judge.    The Canadian Constitution Foundation argued citizens should be allowed to express opinions and criticize health care and services without punishment and noted that because public health care dominates public policy, people should be allowed to speak about it.   The federation also asked the court to consider what kind of precedent this decision sets for all professionals who want to share their opinions or concerns.",technology
194,"Handmaid's Tale, Mrs. Maisel guest stars capture early Emmys","A trio of Emmy-honoured actors are winners again for their guest performances in TV series, joined by an awards newcomer.   Bradley Whitford and Cherry Jones received trophies for their The Handmaid's Tale roles at Sunday's creative arts Emmy ceremony.  Jane Lynch and Luke Kirby won on the comedy side, both for The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.  Game of Thrones led with 10 Emmys in technical and other categories at the two-night weekend ceremony, which is the precursor to the main Emmy Awards that will air Sept. 22 on Fox.     The 10 wins included a trophy for Halifax's Paula Fairfield in the sound editing category as part of the team on the HBO drama. It's Fairfield's second win after nabbing a trophy for the same series in 2015. She's been nominated for Game of Thrones in four other years, and received three previous nominations for work on ABCu002FCTV's Lost.    Meanwhile, Montreal-based Elisabeth Williams was among the team of winners for best production design for The Handmaid's Tale, which airs on Crave. She also won last year for the series, and earned a nomination in 2016 for FX's ​​​​​​​Fargo.  The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel was the top comedy series winner, with six awards.  Stage and screen star Jones, who previously won for 24, heaped praise backstage on fellow nominee Phylicia Rashad (This Is Us), calling it ""absurd"" that Rashad has yet to win an Emmy despite four nominations, and saluted Cicely Tyson, nominated for How to Get Away with Murder.  ""I got to tell Ms. Tyson tonight that watching the Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman. is one of the things that made me want to be an actress, and I tell her that every time I see her and she always rolls her eyes,"" Jones said.  Whitford has an Emmy for The West Wing and one for Transparent — the latter for guest actor in a comedy, making him the first actor to win comedy and drama guest star Emmys.    In his acceptance speech, Whitford struck a political note as he thanked Margaret Atwood for the titular novel that is the basis of the dystopian The Handmaid's Tale.  Atwood is ""giving us perspective in this disorienting moment as we are inundated and undermined by a misogynistic, radical, right-wing ideology,"" he said.    ""She understands three things: Despair is not an option. Our children can't afford it. Action is the antidote to despair.""  'They inspire me'  Lynch, who added to her four previous Emmys for series including Glee and Hollywood Game Night, said she based her portrayal of a 1950s comic on the women she grew up watching.  ""I went right to the source: Phyllis Diller, Totie Fields, Moms Mabley,"" Lynch said.  ""Back then, in order for a woman to be in comedy, she had to have a gimmick. Usually that meant cracking wise about her own looks, her bad body, how she can't hold on to a man . but these women did it with such panache and style and such self-possession, and they inspire me.""    Canadian actor Kirby, who played Lenny Bruce on The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, has also appeared in The Deuce and Rectify.    The British marital comedy State of the Union won the Emmy for best short-form comedy or drama series, with short-form acting honours going to its stars, Chris O'Dowd and Rosamund Pike.  Leaving Neverland, which details two men's allegations that pop star Michael Jackson sexually abused them as children, was honoured at Saturday's ceremony as best documentary or nonfiction special.    Before his 2009 death, Jackson denied repeated, similar allegations against him, and his estate has denounced the documentary.    Beyoncé, whose 2018 Coachella festival concert film Homecoming went into Saturday's ceremony with six Emmy nominations, was beaten in all categories.  James Corden's Carpool Karaoke special with former Beatle Paul McCartney returning to his Liverpool hometown won over Homecoming for pre-recorded variety special, while the filmed version of Bruce Springsteen's acclaimed one-man Broadway show triumphed for variety special directing.      Among other awards presented:     Animated program: The Simpsons: ""Mad About the Toy.""   Character voice-over performance: Seth MacFarlane, Family Guy: ""Con Heiress.""   Host for a reality or competition program: RuPaul, RuPaul's Drag Race.   Unstructured reality program: United Shades of America with W. Kamau Bell.   Documentary or nonfiction series: Our Planet.   Commercial: Dream Crazy, Nike.   Music composition for a limited series, movie or special (original dramatic score): Hildur Gudnadottir, Chernobyl: Please Remain Calm.

195,From YouTube to mainstream TV: Lilly Singh and Issa Rae's unconventional paths to success,"In an opening musical rap number for her new show, Lilly Singh poked fun at being a different face of late-night TV.  ""I know you're used to only Jimmys in the spotlight, but I'm gonna throw some melanin up in your late night.""   The 30-year-old YouTube star turned television host is the first bisexual woman of colour to host a late-night show on a major TV network — a point she cleverly joked about in her opening monologue during her show's debut on Monday.  Singh, a native of Scarborough, Ont., is making headlines this week with A Little Late with Lilly Singh, which replaced Last Call With Carson Daly on NBC after 18 seasons.  Sticking true to her internet roots, A Little Late's first-ever episode was streamed on YouTube a few hours before its cable-TV debut — a strategic decision by NBC to tap into the online fan base Singh steadily has built over the last decade through her channel, Superwoman.    Nearly 15 million subscribers follow the YouTube account, where she uploads videos of original skits, interviews and monologues about everything from pop culture to her experience as a child of immigrant Indian parents.  Her brand of comedy resonated with an online audience and helped her land on Forbes' list of highest paid YouTube stars in 2017. It wasn't long before big names, including Dwayne (The Rock) Johnson and Michelle Obama, made appearances on her channel.     ""She essentially has been doing the job on YouTube for like the last 10 years,"" said John Irwin, the executive producer of A Little Late with Lilly Singh, in an interview with CBC News.  That experience self-producing sketches and engaging interviews makes her a natural fit to host a talk show, he added.  Irwin said he first learned of Singh a few years ago, because his daughter used to watch her videos.   ""YouTube and all of these various platforms have opened the door for basically … anybody to be a star. There's just so many ways to now find new talent,"" he said. ""It's going to be interesting to watch how our business continues to morph.""    Singh's talent and charisma sets her apart from traditional comedians who enter late-night and struggle to find their sweet spot, said Irwin, who has worked for Saturday Night Live's Lorne Michaels, as well as produced for Conan O'Brien and Mad TV.   ""There's just that, like, uncomfortableness, where you're watching the host trying to procure an interview, and feel natural and be funny  — and Lilly just, like, had it.""   Singh's first episode Monday featured comedians and stars of The Office, Rainn Wilson and Mindy Kaling. Saturday Night Live funnyman Kenan Thompson, sitcom star Tracee Ellis Ross and comedian Chelsea Handler also made appearances.    While A Little Late boasts a gender-balanced and inclusive writers' room, another distinct feature is Singh's decision to steer away from politics — a topic that dominates late-night TV.  ""[It's] sort of a refreshing sort of stance right out of the gate, because I think you can turn on any one of these shows right now and, for the most part, you're getting the same messaging every single day,"" said Irwin.    Marty Younge, a Toronto-based arts and culture writer, has been watching Singh's career over the years and says her versatility and existing fan base is a huge plus for NBC.  ""She has tremendous crossover potential, because she's already demonstrated, as a YouTuber, the ability to make a lot of content … content that resonates with a large fan base and a younger fan base that is advantageous to them.""     Younge also points to the changing nature of late-night TV, with hosts creating catchy, viral videos that live beyond the early-morning audience and rack up millions of views online. It's likely another reason NBC plans to make sure A Little Late has a strong online presence.  ""Who better to make that digital content other than Lilly Singh?"" she said.    Still, Singh, who is used to working with a small team, will have to adapt to performing in front of a studio audience and working with a large team of writers. ""It will be interesting to see how she transitions into the new medium without alienating her old fans,"" said Younge.  One of the first examples of someone who has successfully made the transition from YouTube to mainstream television is Emmy-nominated actress Issa Rae.  Rae is the star, executive producer and writer of HBO's Insecure, now headed into its fourth season. But Rae got her start on YouTube, where she launched her comedy web-series Awkward Black Girl in 2011.    The show soon caught the attention of comedian and producer Larry Wilmore, who gave Rae her first break and helped her write and create her first TV pilot.  ""I'm here because the internet,"" Rae said in an interview with CBC News, talking about her unconventional path. ""There wasn't a blueprint for getting your show on television.""  Watch Issa Rae talk about paving a new path in Hollywood:    Since the success of Insecure, Rae has starred in a number of film projects, including Little and The Hate U Give. She's also the executive producer behind HBO's A Black Lady Sketch Show, a sketch-comedy late-night series that features a black female director, cast, and writers' room. It was recently renewed for a second season.  Rae says it's inspiring to see how talent born out of the digital space can break barriers in film and television today.  ""I see a lot of leaders, I see a lot of people opening doors,"" she said. ""I see us taking the reins on a lot of our content.""",entertainment
196,Are Quebecers hypocrites when it comes to climate change?,"When they step into the voting booth, will Quebecers put their votes where their mouths are when it comes to climate change?  By many measures, the environment is an issue that matters to Quebecers.  Later this week, tens of thousands are expected to take part in a march through Montreal calling for concrete action on global warming. Polls routinely put the environment at the top of Quebecers' lists of most pressing issues and, according to research at the Université de Montréal, climate change is as important in many rural areas as it is in cities.  Quebecers who took part in CBC's Vote Compass also prioritized the environment as an election issue more than citizens of any other province.    ""The people of Quebec feel a lot more ownership for Quebec than, I think, the rest of Canada feels for their own local environment,"" said Ben Clarkson, English spokesperson for La Planète s'invite au parlement, one of the groups organizing the Sept. 27 climate protest.  ""Quebec sees itself as having a relationship to the land.""  'Like any other North American'  But that isn't quite how they behave, said Prof. Pierre-Olivier Pineau, chair of energy sector management at the business school HEC Montréal.  While Quebec is the province with the lowest per capita emissions, that's largely due to the fact that the province's electricity is produced without fossil fuels — and not because Quebecers are inherently more environmentally friendly, Pineau said.  ""Quebecers behave like any other North American,"" he said.  ""They will eat meat — that has a higher greenhouse gas impact. They travel about more and more by SUV. That also has a big impact. There is no difference in terms of behaviour between Quebecers and other Canadians.""    Pineau co-authored a 2018 study that found Quebec SUV and truck sales have climbed 246 per cent since 1990, while the number of car sales has fallen by 28 per cent.  According to Statistics Canada, Quebecers bought approximately 3,387 light trucks (which includes SUVs and minivans) per 100,000 people in 2018. The Canadian average is 3,796.  The Conference Board of Canada, a non-profit and non-partisan think tank, gave Quebec a ""C"" grade on waste generation and a ""D-"" on energy consumption and intensity.  However, Pineau said there is general agreement among Quebecers that climate change is an issue that needs addressing.  ""Maybe it's hypocrisy, maybe a misunderstanding of what's needed,"" Pineau said. ""But Quebecers do have the aspiration to fight climate change and be good from an environmental perspective.""    He said that even if Quebecers are not, individually, acting to reduce their emissions, the sentiment does ""translate into some political support for big goals.""  Choices, choices   But does that mean environmentally conscious parties will win big in the voting booth?  Not necessarily, said Jean-François Daoust, a post-doctoral fellow at McGill's Centre for the Study of Democratic Citizenship. Daoust, who studies voter behaviour, said it's rare to see a correlation between an issue's importance and voting patterns.  ""For example, 62 per cent of Canadians said that they attribute a lot of attention to the environment in 2015,"" Daoust said. ""But that did not reflect at all at the voting booth as an advantage for the Green Party.""  He pointed out that during the 2018 provincial election, the environment ranked as one of the top issues for Quebecers. Voters still went on to elect a majority Coalition Avenir Québec (CAQ) government, ""which is not necessarily the party that is associated with proactive environmental action,"" he said.  The CAQ scored the lowest among the province's major parties on a report card prepared by environmental groups.     Why the difference? Even for voters passionate about the environment, Daoust said, the issue isn't necessarily top of mind when it comes time to vote.  And Clarkson said focusing on individual actions doesn't help in the fight against climate change.  ""What individual actions can I take to stop the burning of the Amazon?"" he asked.  ""Individuals don't achieve things. Movements achieve things. The banning of child labour was not ended by an individual.""    Clarkson said that, regardless of how many people come out to protest on Sept. 27, he will only consider the event a success if the government meets their demands by creating ""enforceable laws to transform society"" and limiting greenhouse gas emissions.  ""We have a long, long journey ahead of us to create an industrial system where we can live on this planet long term,"" he said.  ""It's not going to be won in a day. But we can get started now.""",politics
197,"1 in 5 people without a family doctor in N.L., says medical association","A lack of family physicians is a growing problem, and the province needs to rethink how it delivers health-care services, says the Newfoundland and Labrador Medical Association.  ""It's a complex situation that's been going on for a long time,"" says Dr. Charlene Fitzgerald, head of the NLMA.  The association commissioned Narrative Research, formerly Corporate Research Associates, to conduct a phone survey, asking people how many of them are currently under the care of a family doctor.  That phone poll was conducted from Aug. 8 to 25, with a random sample of 400 adults. Results are accurate to within 4.9 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.  Of those asked, 81 per cent of people reported that yes, they do have a family doctor, while 19 per cent said they did not. The percentage of people without a doctor amounts to as many as 99,000 residents, the NLMA said.      You can't walk in and have your congestive heart failure, diabetes, emphysema and depression managed in a walk-in clinic.  - Charlene Fitzgerald     For the people who responded they do not have a family doctor, most people reported attending a walk-in clinic service to get their required medical care. Another 42 per cent said they go to the emergency room, while 13 per cent said they go to a general hospital intake for medical services.  ""The first step to finding solutions to a problem is really seeing what the problem is,"" said Fitzgerald, adding that the NLMA has hired a consultant to look into how many family doctors are practising on the ground, how many will be needed in five years, and how many will be needed in 10 years.  ""This is foundational work that needs to be done, and we're going to be releasing it to government once it's done and obviously to the public.""  The NLMA is meeting with Health Minister John Haggie and department officials on Wednesday to discuss the latest poll numbers.  Exodus of family doctors  In the meantime, Fitzgerald said the ""erosion of family medicine in Newfoundland and Labrador is not news,"" adding it's been ongoing in rural parts of the province for years.  ""Rurally, we've seen for many, many years a rotation of family physicians who come and serve for short periods of time and go out, leaving again a new family physician to come back in — if the patients are lucky,"" she said.  ""Now the problem is even inside the overpass, where recent retirements, as well as difficulty in recruiting new-to-practice family physicians, has led to a crisis in family medicine, to the point where patients are adrift.""    Fitzgerald said family practice is a fairly popular discipline at Memorial University's medical school, with more and more students opting into it.  ""However, our numbers show that at the end of their residency training, very few of those actually go into comprehensive community-based family practice,"" she said, adding that many of those who finish their residency here often opt to leave.  Boosting that retention rate, she said, should be the first priority addressed by the province.    ""It's sad to think that they're leaving and working in practices elsewhere, after we've spent a lot of effort and resources in training them, so the recruitment and retention has really got to bump up,"" Fitzgerald told CBC's St. John's Morning Show.  Another rung on the ladder to improving the delivery of health care in the province is reconsidering the current approach.  Walk-in clinics not the answer  Fitzgerald said the family practice of old is a model that doesn't serve the needs of modern patients, and instead, a collaborative, team-based approach is better for everyone.  In addition, she said, consideration should be given to changing the way doctors are paid, and structuring it around the concept of a patient roster, where a physician is caring for and ensuring the good health of a list of regular patients.  That's the kind of care people going to walk-in clinics won't get, she said.  ""Most patients come in on multiple medications, with multiple problems, and they need time and effort and co-ordinated effort. This can't be performed in a fee-for-service system,"" Fitzgerald said.  ""Walk-in clinics are designed to provide one service quickly, and patients nowadays don't need one service quickly, or if they do, many more need comprehensive continuous family medicine care.""  Fitzgerald said more patients now than ever have multiple lifelong conditions that need regular care and attention, and a family physician and team-based approach can be addressed only with consistent care.  ""That kind of problem can't be addressed as a walk-in — you can't walk in and have your congestive heart failure, diabetes, emphysema and depression managed in a walk-in clinic.""

198,"Rising home prices encourage consumers to borrow and spend, giving economy a boost","As Canadian home prices rose from 2014 to 2017, many households tapped the growing value in their homes for other spending, according to study by Bank of Canada economists.  About two million households used home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), but another 380,000 got mortgage financing to raise equity, taking advantage of interest rates that fell in 2015, the researchers say in an analysis released Friday.  That led to an increase of 0.5 per cent in GDP annually because of increased spending, proving the importance of home values to boost consumption and renovation spending, according to researcher Anson Ho.  ""Total equity extraction peaked at $89 billion in 2017. Of this, $49 billion was through HELOCs and $40 billion through mortgage refinancing,"" the study found.  It's generally been a good thing for the economy. Household spending would have been materially lower without equity extraction, the researchers say.  Where the money goes  About 25 per cent of the spending went to home renovations and another quarter went to consumption of other big-ticket items, including cars and furniture. Only about 28 per cent went to debt consolidation, with another 22 per cent going to investments.  The study found household spending tends to rise with home prices. Canadians find it easier to borrow against their homes as values rise.  In 2017, household spending jumped 3.5 per cent, while house prices rose an average of 13 per cent across the country.    Starting in 2015, Albertans were big on tapping HELOCs and refinancing mortgages to tide them over the drop in oil prices.  Conversely, house prices stalled or fell in 2018 and stock markets stumbled. That led to a decline in consumer spending and in borrowing against homes. That could have had a negative impact of 0.1 per cent on the GDP, the researchers found.  ""If this collateral effect is strong, it could leave the economy more vulnerable to adverse events, such as a large decline in house prices,"" the study said.",business
199,Former military ombudsman claims DND vendetta drove him into retirement,"The Department of National Defence conducted a closed-door, wide-ranging review of complaints of mismanagement, nepotism and misuse of public funds in the Office of the Canadian Forces ombudsman last year, CBC News has learned.  The review was instrumental in the early retirement of former watchdog Gary Walbourne, according to recently released Federal Court documents.  In an interview with CBC News, Walbourne said the internal review was a flawed, politically-motivated inquiry intended to isolate and silence him. He also said the process gained significant traction only after a major, private falling out between him and Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan.  Walbourne refused to disclose the substance of his disagreement with the minister in the late winter of 2018, but said it was serious enough that Sajjan refused to speak or even meet with him for the remainder of his tenure.  ""It was a stiff conversation between adults that got a little heated,"" he said. ""Going into detail may breach some of the oaths I've taken as Order in Council appointee.""  Walbourne said that after his clash with Sajjan — which took place in a private meeting on March 1, 2018 in the minister's Parliament Hill office — he quickly found himself out of the loop.  ""Every meeting from that meeting forward was cancelled. There were dozens of them that were set and cancelled over a period of time,"" he said. ""The authorities granted to the ombudsman by the deputy minister's office were altered, changed, truncated, and it just went on and on.""  The conflict, he confirmed, led to him asking for early retirement.  ""For about the last eight or 10 months I was in office, I sat there without financial or human resource authorities signed off by the deputy minister,"" Walbourne said.  ""So when you take away the tools that allow you to do the job, you can't get an audience with the minister to talk about subjects that are of importance ... So there comes a point in time when you have to consider whether I could do any further good.""    Documents, obtained by CBC News through both the Federal Court and independent sources, corroborate Walbourne's statements about the meeting date and the limits placed on his powers.  The apparent falling out with Sajjan was also the culmination of rising friction between the hard-charging, blunt-spoken ombudsman and the defence department, which had grown increasingly irritated with his repeated public criticisms on a number of topics.  The tension in the relationship spilled out into the public in early 2017, when Walbourne complained of ""insidious"" behind-the-scene attacks by DND officials. The relationship was so sour, according to a report at the time by The Canadian Press, that Sajjan wrote to the ombudsman in an attempt to smooth things over.  Walbourne's persistent complaints before parliamentary committees — particularly about the problems of transition to civilian life experienced by military members — were greeted with visible irritation by both military and civilian defence officials.  No answers from Sajjan  Sajjan refused to answer questions about Walbourne's allegations and the revelations in the Federal Court records.  The minister's office released a written statement that did not address the issues and said only that he valued ""the substantive input, mandate and independence"" of the ombudsman's office.  ""I am committed to maintaining a positive and productive working relationship with the Ombudsperson and have encouraged him to come to me should he be facing issues in carrying out his mandate,"" the statement said. ""I will continue to value the work being done by the Office of the Ombudsperson and look forward to continuing to work with the current Ombudsman.""  Gregory Lick was named to replace Walbourne in November of last year.  The review of Walbourne and three other staff members, according to Federal Court records, was carried out by the defence department's assistant deputy minister of review services.  Probe launched after staffer suicide  It was initiated in response to an eight-page written complaint by an investigator on the ombudsman's team after another long-time staffer killed himself in April 2017.  The former ombudsman was accused under the Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act of misuse of public funds, inappropriate hiring practices and promotion without competition, failure to accommodate a mental health disability in relation to the death of his staff member, and failure to create a safe and healthy workplace.  Four of the five complaints against Walbourne were deemed ""founded.""  The allegation of misuse of public funds, involving the hiring of a former journalist to write reports for the office, was thrown out.  Walbourne challenges the remaining findings and denied any wrongdoing.  He said that one of the complaints — of inappropriate hiring — is blatantly false because, while he knew one of the eight applicants for the job in question, he had recused himself from the selection process.  In fact, the staff member, hired in 2014, was vetted by a multi-departmental committee that included an acting assistant deputy minister, a director general from the Public Service Commission and a Department of National Defence human resources executive, according to documents (separate from the court filing) obtained by CBC News.    The defence department was unable to explain how that information was not taken into account in the findings of the investigation against Walbourne.  A former ombudsman's staff member, who left before the complaints were filed, said the watchdog routinely faced pushback from long-time members of the team when he tried to overhaul the office after he took over in 2014.  ""Gary sought to professionalize the investigation teams with mandatory training and the standardization of the way systemic investigations were handled, and how the reports were written,"" said retired lieutenant-colonel Jamie Robertson.   ""This rankled some members of the investigations team — the very same members who were also discontented with the previous ombudsman.""  'No-nonsense, Newfoundlander-direct'  The revamp was a priority following a scathing report by the auditor general, who in 2015 criticized the previous military ombudsman, retired major-general Pierre Daigle, over a host of spending and hiring decisions.  Walbourne's approach ""was always no-nonsense, Newfoundlander-direct,"" and that ruffled feathers, said Robertson.  Other staff members under Walbourne faced similar but separate complaints of misconduct.  Melanie Chapman, Nadine Parker and Robyn Hynes were also faulted by the defence department review.  Chapman, the ombudsman's director of investigations, contested the findings against her. She took her case to Federal Court, saying the independent investigators and senior defence officials who sat in judgment never told her the substance of the complaints and denied her the opportunity to properly defend herself.  A Federal Court judge ruled her treatment by defence officials was unreasonable.  ""She was not given procedural fairness in the investigation process,"" Judge Russel Zinn wrote in a July 23 ruling.  ""She was not clearly apprised on the alleged wrongdoing, and she was not informed what evidence had been gathered by the investigator. In short, she was not given a meaningful right to be heard or given the opportunity to know the case against her at any stage of this process.""  The judge ordered the department to re-examine her case.  'Collateral damage'  Walbourne said he believes the complaints against him and the rest of the staff were handled in the same arbitrary manner.  The investigation, which was conducted by an outside agency before being handed to the head of the defence department's review services, was formally launched in the fall of 2017.  Walbourne said he believes officials seized upon the complaints and made them part of a systematic campaign to discredit his office within the federal government after a series of hard-hitting reports on the transition issues facing members of the military.    ""I do believe the object of the investigation was me, but this investigation was not just about me,"" he told CBC News. ""There were other members of my staff who I consider to be collateral damage.""  The former ombudsman made his concerns about the investigation known to Sajjan when he decided to retire ahead of schedule.  ""The process has been flawed from the beginning and activity throughout has been suspicious,"" he wrote in his March 2, 2018 resignation letter, which was obtained by CBC News. ""The names of those accused have been released and are being shared across the environment. A direct attempt to discredit and defame.""  Court records filed in connection with the Chapman case make reference to a whisper campaign and show a senior staffer in deputy minister Jody Thomas' office acknowledged discussing the investigation of the ombudsman and his staff with at least nine senior defence bureaucrats.    The revelation, according to the court papers, cost Chapman a shot at the leadership of the military's newly created sexual assault response centre.  The court documents also spell out how the defence department altered and limited the financial and human resources powers of the ombudsman while Walbourne was still in charge.  Robertson said that, throughout his time serving two ombudsmen, he saw both examples of extraordinary cooperation and closed-door bureaucratic rebukes.  It is time for change, he said.  ""To be an effective ombudsman you are unlikely to win a popularity contest with the organization you are overseeing,"" said Robertson.  ""Each and every (CAF) ombudsman since 1998 has strongly recommended that the office should report directly to Parliament and should be administratively de-coupled from DND as this gives the department de facto control over financing, [human resources] and other elements that can impact the day to day functioning of the office.""",politics
200,Thomas Cook travel on verge of collapse,"Thomas Cook, one of the world's oldest and largest travel companies, is facing a race against time to stay afloat and ensure that around 150,000 British travellers can get home.  The debt-laden tour operator confirmed Friday it was seeking £200 million ($330 million Cdn) in extra funding to avoid its collapse. If Thomas Cook goes under, Britain's Civil Aviation Authority would likely be ordered to launch a major repatriation operation to fly stranded vacationers home.  The company says it is in talks with stakeholders such as leading Chinese shareholder Fosun to bridge a funding gap. The money required would be a ""seasonal stand-by facility"" and come on top of the £900 million ($1.4 billion) of new capital already raised, Thomas Cook said in a statement Friday.  ""The recapitalization is expected to result in existing shareholders' interests being significantly diluted, with significant risk of no recovery,"" it said.  In May, Thomas Cook reported in half-year results that it had a net debt burden of $2 billion. It said political uncertainty related to Britain's departure from the European Union had led to softer demand for summer holidays. The company said higher fuel and hotel costs also were weighing on business.  A spokesman for Royal Bank of Scotland, one of Thomas Cook's lenders, said the bank ""has provided considerable support"" to the tour operator over many years and ""continues to work with all parties in order to try and find a resolution to the funding and liquidity shortfall.""  Any failure to raise the required capital would elicit questions about the jobs of the 22,000 staff Thomas Cook employs around the world. It sold the Canadian branch of its travel service to Air Transat in 2006.  ""It is appalling that banks that owe their very existence to handouts from the British taxpayer show no allegiance to a great British company, Thomas Cook, when it needs help,"" said Brian Strutton, general secretary of the British Airline Pilots Association.  ""If Thomas Cook goes into administration it will cost the taxpayer as much to repatriate holidaymakers as it would cost to save Thomas Cook,"" Strutton added.  Shares in the company dived 19 per cent on Friday.",business
201,One of Canada's oldest music stores shutting down just shy of 100th anniversary,"Oshawa's Wilson and Lee Music Store has seen a lot in the last 97 years.  The shop was there when player pianos and gramophones were the only way to play recorded music in your home. It was there as vinyl rose to prominence, fell out of favour, and then rose once again.    It has been a fixture in the community for almost a century — but now, what is undoubtedly one of the oldest music shops in the country is closing its doors in December.  The music business just isn't what it once was, and so co-owners Bill and David Wilson feel the time is right to hang it up.  ""I've had a few people trying to talk me into another three years to make it 100, but I'm ready to go,"" Bill Wilson told CBC News at the shop on 87 Simcoe St. N.  ""We're just feeling a difference now. And that's why we're going.""  History stretching back to 1922  The two brothers are the last of three generations of family who have been running the business.  It was started by their grandfather, William George Wilson, way back in 1922. He was a piano tuner who trained at the Canadian National Institute for the Blind and started out fixing up old pianos in a room in his home.  Two years later, he moved into his first shop on Simcoe Street and started bringing in player pianos and piano rolls. Gramophones and record players came next.    William Wilson died in 1941, but Bill and David's father, William Sr., kept things going. The business really flourished when he returned from the service after the Second World War.  The current shop was built in 1953. It's a throwback to the golden age of music stores, full of tapes, CDs, records, sheet music and instruments.    The brothers still show up to work each day neatly dressed in suits. There's no computerized inventory on site — instead, they rely on a borderline encyclopedic knowledge of music and their products.  Standing in the store's vinyl section is where Bill always felt the most at home, surrounded by scores of 45s, 78s and LPs.    ""That's my love. I know this stuff pretty well inside out,"" he said. ""I'm getting a little bit loosey goosey on the new guys, but, you know, I'm not dealing with those people anyone. The kids are streaming and downloading, not buying CDs.""  David, who handles the bulk of the store's instrument sales, has seen similar trends.  ""You can just see it. We're ready to go,"" he said.  'Part of my life'  The shop has meant a lot to people over the years. Sharon Hudson visited on Saturday because she heard it was shutting down.  ""I've been coming here since I learned piano at a very young age. This is where I got all my sheet music when I was learning to play,"" she said.  Now, she brings in her son to pick up his guitar strings, and her daughter for drum sticks. The knowledge the Wilson brothers have at their disposal was just invaluable, she said.  ""They just seem to know everything about everything.""    Though the end is creeping up, it's still tough for David and Bill to fully reflect on just what the store has meant to them all these years.  ""Since the time I've been 14, this has been part of my life,"" David said. ""I've never not done this. I don't know what it's going to be like until I've stopped.  ""[So] ask me that another year from now.""  adam.carter@cbc.ca",entertainment
202,"Céline Dion talks Courage, life after René Angélil and her new outlook","Céline Dion has been reinventing herself ever since she got her first taste of stardom in Quebec at age 12.  At 22 years old, the Charlemagne, Que.-born artist released her first English-language album, Unison, and not long after that she burst into the English-speaking world with a cascade of massive hits, including Beauty and the Beast, The Power of Love and My Heart Will Go On.    In 1994, Dion married her longtime manager, René Angélil, in a lavish ceremony that was one of the biggest celebrity events in Canada's history. Less than a decade later, in 2003, she headed to Las Vegas where her theatrical, explosive concert residency transformed the city.   Today, Dion is evolving again. She's been emerging from the passing of her husband in 2016, she wrapped up her 16-year residency in Las Vegas this summer, and the word that seems to define her the most right now is ""courage."" Beyond describing her current outlook on life, Courage is also the name of her new album and world tour that just kicked off this week in Quebec City.     The Canadian music icon sat down with q host Tom Power in Montreal to tell us more about this new chapter in her life.  Here is part of that conversation.  On her final residence show in Las Vegas  If I recall correctly, people thought that it was going to be very emotional for me, and that it was going to be really hard for me, but I knew what I was getting myself into probably the next day or a couple of days after that. Of course, don't get me wrong, I stayed so long in Vegas ⁠— actually, I still live in Vegas and I raised my kids in Vegas ⁠— it will always be a home for me because this is where I still live. Even though I am in Montreal right now where my roots are and this is really home.  To make a long story short, I felt very strong. When I did the live show, even though there were a lot of butterflies, I did not want to cry. I love what I do and when I get embraced by the audience, I get taken by the emotions. So I said to myself, I want to have a good time, especially tonight, because it's my last show, so let's make it like a party. I have to say, I don't remember if I cried, I don't think I did. If I did not cry, I'm very proud of myself. Everything that I've done for so long there with my team, we have accomplished so much and I'm proud of that.  On what the word ""courage"" means to her  Well, it means that everybody is going through things in life. I would say when something bad happens to you in life, you have to find a way to overcome these obstacles and find a way to find inner strength. To say, that's part of life, this is not something that you choose. This is something that is imposed on you by life. It's up to you to go through these obstacles, and you have the options, if you're going to need help or not, or how you're going to go through this. We all do have good moments and bad moments. And we all lose people.    On the loss of her late husband and longtime manager, René Angélil  Losing the father of my children, my husband, my manager, the person that I love the most in the world and the person that I can rely upon without questioning anything since I was 12 years old — losing that person was a big deal for me. It reflected on a lot of people that I've been surrounded by for 20 years. We are still missing him tremendously, believe it or not.  It takes courage because I'm a single mom and I don't want my kids, my entourage and the people that I love to feel that because I have lost the man of my life that I'm going to lose the essence of what I love, my passion.  I really believe that through all the years with René, who gave me so much, who taught me so much, who gave me so much luggage, that when he left for his new chapter, his new life, he gave me the rest of his luggage. I feel him through the eyes of my kids and inside of me. I felt very, very, very strong, probably stronger than ever before.  On the evolution of her career and younger generations discovering her music for the first time  Well, I don't know. Don't make me blush. I'm happy. I see it. Don't get me wrong, you cannot please everybody, but I don't care. I've done everything that's needed to be done to have an international career because this is what I wanted. I don't need to prove to my family, my friends, the industry or myself anymore. I did that. They gave me a spot and I took it. I never wanted to have a hit, I wanted to have a career.    On working with producer David Foster on All By Myself  David and I had taken a whole day with the piano on a speakerphone to choose the key. I arrived in L.A. and he says, ""You're gonna freak out. I'm so happy about my production. I'm going to play you the track. Let's do this. It's going to be amazing. It's going to be big."" I mean, with David, everything's going to be big, you know? So it was amazing, but then I said, ""David, is that the final key?"" I think it was like a key and a half higher, and I'm like, okay, why did we spend a whole day on the key that works and now I'm over here? I think everything exploded, my pants, my bra, my shirt. When I hit that note, what you hear in the back is not the drums, it's my clothes that exploded. People stop breathing when I hit that note.    On how it feels to be back home in Quebec  It's amazing. To see my kids enjoy where I grew up, where they don't come enough, and to see their uncles and my mom, and to play outside in their bare feet and they don't burn their feet. Vegas has given us a lot over all these years, but when you go outside in bare feet in Vegas, you might come back with melted toenails. So here it's like the weather, and the nature, and to pick tomatoes from our little gardens. For the kids to just play badminton, and ball, and bicycle, it's like I said, these are the moments that they will never forget. This is a heritage that I give them and I'm so lucky that I was born here. This is the blood that's going through my veins mixed with some maple syrup. So that's why I'm a sweet girl.  Dion just launched a world tour called Courage. Her latest album, also called Courage, will be released later this year. Below are three songs from the new album.

203,More Fed cuts expected to push Canadian interest rates lower: Don Pittis,"A weakening global economy and continued trade fears — and emphatically, he said, not angry words from U.S. President Donald Trump — convinced U.S. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates on Wednesday for the second time this summer.  And for Canadians waiting for lower rates, those same global forces are on their way, and will likely force Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz to follow suit.  Despite the fact that the quarter point cut was widely expected, the move had an immediate effect on the Canadian dollar which fell promptly after Powell's announcement.   While Powell said shrinking industrial activity justified the cut, he insisted that he and his advisers expect the economy to continue to grow, and predicted there would likely be no more interest rate cuts this year.  Markets — which have been predicting a series of cuts and, until recently, expected a larger half point cut — tumbled on the news.  After repeated attacks on Powell and the central bank, whom Trump recently described as ""boneheads,"" it was hardly surprising that the president expressed his unhappiness with the Fed chair's mild rate cut.    ""Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve Fail Again. No 'guts,' no sense, no vision!"" tweeted the U.S. president.  Powell insisted that such insults were not going change the bank's outlook, and that despite the repeated attacks morale within the organization remains strong.  ""I assure you that my colleagues and I will continue to conduct monetary policy without regard to political considerations,"" said Powell.  He said the bank's decision not to make the kind of deep cuts Trump has been demanding is because much of the economy remains robust.  ""The consumer is spending at a healthy clip,"" said Powell. ""The labour market is still strong.""  'Good solid year'  Powell sees growth for 2019 and 2020 coming in at two per cent, which he described as ""a good solid year,"" and the purpose of the two rate cuts this summer, he said, have been to keep the economic expansion alive.   ""If you look at things that are happening in the economy, I personally see a high value in sustaining the expansion because we really are reaching, this positive economy is reaching, communities that haven't been reached in a long time,"" said Powell.  If that stimulus acts as intended, the economic boost is likely to work its way across the border into Canada, perhaps delaying the need for rate cuts here.  ""Global capital markets are highly integrated and our long rates are definitely pulled down by the very, very low rates that are abroad,"" said Powell. Those low overseas rates are one of the reasons for the inverted yield curve — a potential recessionary indicator from the bond market — and are a sign that parts of the global economy are on the rocks, he said.     The Bank of Canada always insists it is not directly affected by U.S. interest policy moves, says Scott Aquanno, a political economist at Ontario Tech University, in Oshawa, Ont., who studies central banking.  But just as Powell fears possible contagion from the struggling economies of China and Europe, Canada will also feel the effects of U.S. moves.  ""The domestic conditions that the Bank of Canada references when they say they are going to act on their own terms are set, in many respects, by what the Federal Reserve does,"" said Aquanno. And that means lower rates are coming to Canada too, he said.  ""It won't act immediately because these kinds of things take a little while to trickle through the economy and to play out, but this does indicate … that the long-term trajectory for the Bank of Canada is a rate cut not a rate increase.""    Market disruption  At Wednesday's news conference Powell was asked about this week's credit crunch in short-term money, in what is called the repo market, when a shortage of lenders in the market for overnight money pushed rates far above the central bank's interest rate range, indicating the Fed had been caught short.   Because something similar happened before the 2007-08 credit crunch that led to the Great Recession, online chatter worried this week's market jolt was a symptom of something worse. That was a view Powell was anxious to dispel.   ""We don't see this as having any implication for the broader economy or for the economic outlook,"" Powell told reporters.  But when the central bank began its emergency lending this week, banks came cap in hand for $53 billion US on Tuesday and another $80 billion on Wednesday.    ""That's $130-plus billion the banks have asked the Federal Reserve for, so that's not insignificant, and in many respects it's starting to feel like a mini, kind-of crisis within short-term funding markets,"" said Aquanno.  The Fed is expected to release another $75 billion today in an attempt to steady the market, and Aquanno says it is crucial that they do for not just the U.S. but the Canadian and the global market.  ""Once the Fed loses the capacity, or is perceived to have lost capacity to manage short-term rates, then that introduces tremendous volatility into the system because the Fed remains the global central bank, even more so that it did 15 years ago.""

204,Why a 'just transition' doesn't have to pit jobs against the environment,"This story is part of a CBC News series entitled In Our Backyard, which looks at the effects climate change is having in Canada, from extreme weather events to how it's reshaping our economy.    One of the recurring themes among some politicians and business leaders is that climate change presents a binary choice between preserving jobs or the environment.  But that's not the way Dwaine MacDonald sees it. MacDonald is one of the co-founders of Trinity Energy Group, a company based in Stellarton, N.S., that makes commercial and residential buildings more energy-efficient, through better insulation and thermal barriers. And business is very good.  To give a sense of Trinity's expertise, in 2010, the company worked on a 14-bedroom farmhouse that every year required 14 cords of wood and two barrels of oil for their heating needs. Trinity's retrofit brought it down to four cords of wood and half a barrel of oil.    This example shows why the International Energy Agency has identified energy efficiency as one of the most effective ways of reducing carbon emissions. It also shows why a concerted transition to a low-carbon economy can be beneficial to both the environment and blue-collar and unionized workers, including those in the fossil fuel industry.  Since MacDonald and his partners launched the company in 2006, Trinity has grown to 80 full-time employees — and he estimates that about a quarter of them are people who were let go from, or simply left, jobs in the Alberta oilsands.  ""I could be hiring more people if I could keep up with the demand,"" said MacDonald. ""It's slowing us down right now, just trying to find the right people.""  As a sign of labour's stake in the environmental challenge, Unifor, the largest private-sector union in Canada, voted to join the global climate strikes scheduled to take place across the country and around the world, on Sept. 20 and Sept. 27.  Major unions in France, Germany and Italy have also announced their intent to join the climate strikers.  Changing tone  The working class is increasingly on-side with climate action, said Jamie Kirkpatrick, program manager at Blue Green Canada, an organization that advocates for workers and the environment, and is aligned with Unifor and the United Steelworkers.  But Kirkpatrick acknowledges there is ""fear and concern"" among some workers about what a transition to a low-carbon economy means for them. Part of that has to do with the sometimes abrasive tone of climate activists.    ""I think a lot of environmental efforts were focused on 'shut this thing down,' 'phase this out,' 'get rid of that dirty, nasty industry,'"" said Kirkpatrick. ""And I think we've learned a lot about how everybody involved is a human being, and we could talk about [a transition] in a more human way.""  You can see that more measured tone in the messaging of the federal Green Party, for example. The party's platform includes halting federal subsidies to the oil sector and cancelling the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project as part of a larger effort to drastically reduce Canada's greenhouse gas emissions.  But Green Party Leader Elizabeth May has stressed ""we are not at war with fossil fuel workers. We are not at all willing to leave any part of Canada or any community behind.""  Kirkpatrick said his organization strives to ""make the connections, and make it true that you can have a good job and a healthy environment.""    'We're missing half the picture'  Kirkpatrick said it has been hard for a lot of workers to visualize the employment possibilities in what's become known as a ""just transition."" Some of that has been down to a lack of data about the size of the green sector.  Earlier this year, Clean Energy Canada, a think-tank at Simon Fraser University, put out a report that quantified the number of clean-energy jobs by combing through the latest available data from a variety of sources, including Statistics Canada.    Clean Energy Canada found that in 2017, there were almost 300,000 jobs in the clean-energy sector — more than the approximately 200,000 positions in the petroleum sector.  ""When we talk about energy, we really all think about oil and gas,"" said Merran Smith, executive director at Clean Energy Canada. ""But we're missing half the picture.""    Clean Energy Canada's research also seeks to expand the understanding of what ""green jobs"" even means. Smith points out it can include everything from energy efficiency to installing solar panels to companies building electric buses, such as New Flyer in Winnipeg and the Lion Electric Company in Quebec.  Personal challenges  Unifor and the United Steelworkers have both passed resolutions on the need for Canada to meet the emissions reductions targets in the Paris Agreement. But acknowledging the need to preserve the environment doesn't mean there aren't significant personal challenges.  Roy Milne, who has worked at the Highvale Coal Mine near Wabamun, Alta., since 1983, has seen how rocky this transition can be. Operated by TransAlta, Highvale has supplied coal to the Sundance and Keephills power stations for decades. As part of government efforts to draw down coal power, the plants are moving to cleaner-burning natural gas within the next few years.    Milne, who is president of United Steelworkers Local 1595, understands the need to reduce carbon emissions and attended last year's international climate conference in Katowice, Poland, to learn about how other countries were managing the transition.  He said TransAlta ""got a big chunk of change"" from the provincial government in compensation for an early shutdown of the Keephills 3 plant and the cancellation of power-purchase agreements. This, combined with the federal government's extension of operating licences for switching from coal to natural gas, is resulting in hundreds of layoffs.    Milne, who is 60, said he's less concerned about his own future than that of younger union members considering their options in the cleantech sector. He said that an electrician working at Highvale currently makes between $120,000 and $150,000 a year. If that person were to switch to installing solar panels, after taking a government-sponsored course, they could expect to make about $40,000-$60,000.  ""It's pretty hard to get workers enthused about a transition to a green economy when it means the reality, at least for us out here, is cut my wages in at least half and take away all my benefits and pension and make it precarious employment,"" Milne said.  Ensuring a just transition  Given that government is setting these environmental goals, Milne said government should also provide a blueprint and the necessary training to ensure a transition is indeed ""just.""  Dwaine MacDonald can certainly attest to this. Trinity Energy Group benefited from Efficiency Nova Scotia (formerly Conserve Nova Scotia), a program that aligned utilities with local contractors in a concerted bid to improve energy efficiency provincewide.  ""That support from the province was instrumental,"" said MacDonald, who points out that Efficiency Nova Scotia's operating model has garnered interest from other provinces, U.S. states and even Bermuda.  ""It's doing good for the environment and it's doing good for the residents of the province,"" said MacDonald. ""It's mind-boggling the spinoffs we see.""",technology
205,Trudeau faces friendly crowd at Saskatoon town hall after a day of damage control over blackface photos,"A day after Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau's campaign was knocked off balance by several photos and a video that showed him in blackface, he faced questions from a relatively friendly Liberal crowd at a town hall event in Saskatoon, Sask. on Thursday evening.  The event, originally billed by the Liberal campaign as a rally, attracted around 500 people, and saw Trudeau questioned about his plans for combating climate change, advancing reconciliation and helping small businesses.  He also faced, for the first time directly from Canadians, questions on the blackface photos that have upended his campaign.  Minutes after Trudeau delivered his opening remarks, Trudeau was asked whether, if he couldn't recollect the precise number of times he's worn blackface makeup, he could ""round to the nearest five.""  ""It's not something we should make light of,"" said Trudeau, who declined to offer a number.    ""What I did was inexcusable and wrong and hurt a lot of people who considered me to be an ally and that was wrong. And I am deeply, deeply sorry.""  In the next comment from the crowd, a man in a yellow vest — who was wearing it not as a statement but because it is part of his safety gear for his job as a fuel distributor — told Trudeau he didn't think he should apologize.    ""Please do not apologize. When you were young, you were in school,"" he said.  ""I appreciate that and I appreciate the sentiment — but there was no excusing what I did and I'm sorry that I did it,"" Trudeau said.  ""And the same time yes, we do need to focus on how we move forward as a country on many big issues … one of those issues is making sure we have leaders that don't hurt people who face discrimination in their daily lives.""    Trudeau was also asked about his plans to de-escalate the tensions between India and Pakistan, fight fires in the Amazon rainforest and invest in science and technology.  One woman, who said she was a single mother and award-winning photographer ""drowning"" in debt, asked whether Trudeau would hire her as his personal photographer or accept ""a free photo session as payment for my accumulated government debt.""    Trudeau answered by touting his government's Canada Child Benefit and promising that a newly elected Liberal government would increase that benefit by 10 per cent per child in the first year after they're born, and suggesting a Conservative government led by Andrew Scheer would mean cuts to services and to the middle class.  Asked about climate, Trudeau spoke about his party's carbon tax, an issue of contention in Saskatchewan, saying ""Scheer's 'make pollution free again' is a real problem.""

206,NDP candidate urges Elections Canada to ensure smooth vote in remote First Nations ,"The federal NDP candidate running in the Ontario riding of Kenora has written Elections Canada urging it to ensure voters in remote First Nations in the riding don't face the same obstacles to casting ballots that surfaced in the 2015 election.   Grassy Narrows First Nations Chief Rudy Turtle sent a letter to Canada's chief electoral officer Stéphane Perrault on Thursday asking how the electoral agency plans to avoid issues like shortages of ballots and the delayed opening of voting stations in the upcoming vote.   ""First Nations living in the electoral district of Kenora have faced serious barriers to exercising their democratic rights in the past, especially during the 2015 election, as a result of administrative failures,"" said the letter, provided to CBC News.   ""I look forward to hearing how Elections Canada plans on addressing these issues in the current election.""  Turtle could not be reached for comment.     The NDP said in a statement that the party raised voting issues in the region with Elections Canada during the last election.   ""[The] letter is both a call to ensure that Elections Canada does what it takes and an opportunity for them to share with us the work they may have already done to ensure that every First Nations person in the riding gets the chance to make their voice heard,"" said the statement.  Turtle raised concerns over the shortage of ballots in the First Nations of Eabametoong, Onigaming, Whitefish Bay and Shoal Lake 40 in the riding in the last election.   ""In two communities this shortfall was addressed by photocopying ballots, however these kinds of situations undermine confidence in the electoral process and can result in excessive wait times,"" wrote Turtle.   ""In some instances where such additional ballots were produced, voters faced long lines and confusion, ultimately resulting in disenfranchised voters leaving the polling station before being provided the opportunity to cast a ballot.""  Polling station closed after running out of ballots  During the 2015 election, 14 on-reserve polling places in nine electoral districts ran low on ballots, according to Elections Canada.  In most cases, voting was interrupted from a few minutes to about a half hour, with one station in Lake St. Martin, Man., shutting down before the polls closed because it ran out of ballots, preventing about 13 voters from casting a ballot, according to Elections Canada.    Turtle's letters raised concerns about the situation in Northwest Angle 37, where parts of the community had no polling station, and in Windigo Island where voters would have to travel over an hour by boat to vote.   One of the issues that also surfaced was over information given to First Nations voters, said the letter. A voter in Big Trout Lake received a voter information card telling him to vote in the community of Wawakapewin, despite there being a polling station in his own community, wrote Turtle.   The letter said there were also concerns about the delay in opening polling stations in the last election in places like Eabametoong and Turtle suggested Elections Canada should provide advance polling in larger rural and remote First Nations and provide mail-in ballots to smaller communities.  Elections Canada says it's working to remove barriers  Elections Canada said in a statement that it had received Turtle's letter and that the agency conducted a ""thorough administrative review"" following the last election and made several changes.   The statement said the agency has improved its ballot forecasting formula to increase the ""cushion for extra ballots in remote areas,"" along with upping its registration rates on reserve and maintaining continual outreach to First Nations.   ""We are aware that Indigenous electors face more barriers to registering and voting in federal elections,"" said the statement.  Elections Canada has also sent a team to Kenora-area First Nations three times since February 2018, running workshops and hosting activities on the electoral process and to improve ways of sharing election information.     The agency is now shipping information packages in English and Ojibway to the Treaty 3 organization to distribute to communities at the upcoming fall assembly in early October.  Five Kenora riding-area First Nations are also among 87 Indigenous communities, across 27 electoral districts, that are part of a recently-created pilot project to deal with specific demands and barriers to voting.   Kenora is one of the ridings identified by the Assembly of First Nations where the Indigenous population could tip the electoral outcome. The riding has an Indigenous population of about 25,162 eligible voters.  The 2015 election saw a spike in on-reserve voter turnout, which hit 61.5 per cent. The on-reserve turnout in 2011 was about 47 per cent, according to Elections Canada data.",politics
207,"Parties are promising to spend spend spend, but details scarce on how they'll pay for it","Vassy Kapelos, host of CBC News Network's Power and Politics  I ran into former Conservative staffers the other day who had worked for Brian Mulroney, some of whom had also worked for Stephen Harper.  No shocker — they're not fans of Justin Trudeau.  But they also don't understand Andrew Scheer and the current Conservative campaign.  ""It's a spend-a-palooza,"" one former staffer remarked to me. ""I just don't get it — they're out of control!""  He was referring to announcements the Conservatives have made over the first 10 days of the campaign: tax credits if you have a kid enrolled in a fitness or arts program, a tax credit if you use public transit, a universal income tax cut, money for medical equipment, expanding RESP grants and making parental benefits tax free.  According to The Canadian Press, the grand total for those promises? About $9 billion — a mix of spending and federal treasury money foregone. Offsetting that, the party so far has said it will review corporate subsidies and come up $1.5 billion of savings.   Don't worry — they're not alone. Every party is willing to spend your money like I spend at Sephora on a Saturday morning.   The Liberals will boost the Canada Child Benefit, also make parental leave benefits tax free and expand them, increase old age security, give money for startup businesses and spend about a half a billion dollars a year to create up to 250,000 more before- and after-school child care spaces.  The NDP and Greens' promises aren't cheap either. Take pharmacare for the NDP, coming in at $10 billion (they say they'd do it within the first year elected), and the Greens promise a guaranteed basic income, which outside estimates have pegged at more than $70 billion.    Don't mistake the math for judgment. These are all worthy proposals for Canadians to consider and they could make a material difference to our lives (I should also point out the Conservatives and NDP provide independent costing of their proposals in real time, while the Liberals and Greens will only do so with their full platforms — date TBD).  But largely absent in the conversation up to this point is that fulfilling those promises will involve trade-offs.

""There's an opportunity cost when we're giving something up; whether it's our money or whether the government is going to give up money… we really need to be careful, and to think about how all of these things fit together and what that means for the government's bottom line.""  The spend-a-palooza could mean one of three things. Either the deficit gets bigger (because revenue is down or spending is up), spending gets cut or the government finds new ways to raise revenues (because no party will dare say they're raising taxes on the average voter).    I was terrible at math (there's a reason I'm a journalist), but even to me that's obvious.  So what will the parties do? Will the deficit increase or will spending slow down? The either-or has informed the political discussion for the last four years and especially since Ontario Premier Doug Ford's budget in April.   You remember it: spending slowed or was cut in a bunch of areas — and then there was a backlash and many of those decisions were reversed. Within a few months, prior to a lot of it being reversed, Ford's popularity plummeted and the federal Liberals started using his name as much as I eat carbs — which is a lot.   The debate, if you can call it that, then became: the Liberals will spend all your money and your kids will pay for it, or the Conservatives will cut everything so your kids won't even have pens at school.  I'm doubtful either is true, but the politics of the months following the Ontario budget have obviously affected the way this campaign is being communicated. Yes, Andrew Scheer talks about balancing the budget, but there's no real focus on it. At each of his stump stops, there's not much about how it would happen (yet) or where spending could slow.   Again — that's not unique to the Conservatives. The Greens also promise to get back to balanced books, but we're still waiting for the details. And how much are the Liberals or NDP willing to add to the deficit? Is there a limit to how much they're willing to pile on? I have no clue because ain't nobody talkin' 'bout it.   Politicians have apparently made the determination it wouldn't be popular to do so.    Power Lines  The Power &amp; Politics Power Panelists on where the big parties will be focused this week  Amanda Alvaro  president and co-founder of Pomp &amp; Circumstance The Liberals will be seeking as many opportunities as possible for Canadians to connect with the leader in order to air their concerns and hear from him directly. Expect the Liberals to continue to contrast their approach of progress and investment for the middle class against some of the expected Conservative cuts to services families rely on.   Rachel Curran senior associate at Harper &amp; Associates Consulting Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer will continue to reveal elements of his plan next week to put more money back in the pockets of Canadian taxpayers., including introducing a Universal Tax Cut for all taxpayers worth up to $850 per year and reintroducing the Children's Fitness and Arts Tax Credits. At the same time, he will argue that Liberal leader Justin Trudeau has lost the moral authority to govern, on the heels of the bombshell ""blackface"" revelations this week.  Kathleen Monk principal at Earnscliffe Strategy Group New Democrat Leader Jagmeet Singh showed this past week what authentic leadership looks like. He spoke from the heart directly to those hurt by experiences of racism. As the climate strike builds and protests happen around the globe, New Democrats will continue to show the importance of matching strong words with a commitment to real action to fight the climate crisis.    Poll Tracker Takeaway   Éric Grenier's weekly look at key numbers in the political public opinion polls.   It will take a while for the polls to begin registering the fallout from last week's revelation that Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau was photographed wearing blackface makeup on several occasions.  We'll start seeing data reflecting people's opinions over the next few days - but it could take a week or two before we can truly gauge the longer-term impact.  What's unlikely to change is the general make-up of the electorate — and a recent poll by the Innovative Research Group takes a fascinating approach to analyzing voters.  The poll, conducted over the first week of the campaign, included a breakdown of respondents divided between those who were committed to voting for one party and those who were still considering their options.    Reading this online? Sign-up for the newsletter to get it delivered to your inbox every Sunday – then daily during the campaign.    Outside of Quebec, the poll found that 29 per cent of the electorate is unaligned — that's the biggest single chunk of voters. These people are undecided or not yet committed to one party or another.  The next biggest group were ""Core Conservatives""; they represent 17 per cent of the electorate. The next biggest group, at 13 per cent, were those classified as ""Core Liberals.""  The other parties and swing voters made up smaller slices of the pie.  What's interesting about this poll is how it shows that the electoral playing field is far more nuanced than it might seem. For instance, outside of Quebec there are as many Liberal-Conservative swing voters as there are voters considering both the Conservatives and either the New Democrats or Greens.  There are more NDP-Conservative swing voters than Conservative-People's Party swing voters. There are twice as many Liberal-Green voters as there are Green-NDP swingers.  In Quebec, the Liberals appear to be competing for more voters with the Conservatives than with any other party. The Bloc Québécois needs to worry more about bleeding support to the Liberals or the Conservatives than to the New Democrats.  The biggest takeaway is that there are a lot of voters out there considering their options. Throughout the country, only 39 per cent of the electorate is considered ""core"" to one party or another. That means the rest is up for grabs — but in a way that's not as simple as we might think.

208,Nearly 700 workers temporarily laid off at St. Catharines GM plant,"Union officials say nearly 700 workers at the General Motors propulsion plant in St. Catharines were handed temporary layoff notices Friday.  Tim McKinnon, unit chairperson for Unifor Local 199, said the majority of the plant's workers will be off the job as of Monday.  About 450 workers will continue working on the transmission line, but their future is uncertain, too.  ""At the end of next week, if nothing changes with the UAW, it will probably put the entire plant out.""  The St. Catharines workers join thousands of others in Ontario's auto industry who have been temporarily laid off after United Auto Workers members at GM's U.S. operations walked off the job for the first time in more than a decade Monday. They walked out over issues that include wages, health care and job security.  GM has also halted production at its Oshawa Assembly Plant, leaving about 2,000 hourly employees off the job and creating a ripple effect among the suppliers who depend on it.    In an email to CBC News, a GM spokesperson confirmed the company had seen a ""disruption"" at its assembly plant in Oshawa due to the UAW strike, but that stamping operations in Oshawa and operations in Ingersoll and St. Catharines continued Friday.  ""We plan to resume these operations as quickly as possible upon resolution of the UAW strike,"" wrote Jacqueline Thomson.  McKinnon said the problem for workers in St. Catharines is that the V8 and V6 engines they produce at the plant ship to the U.S.  ""We don't have anywhere to ship"" during the strike, he explained.  The union representative said laid off workers will be able to access unemployment insurance — about 50 per cent of their wage.  Those who have been employed at the plant for six years or more qualify for supplementary pay that's about 65 per cent of their wage.  McKinnon added so far the situation has been going better than he anticipated.  ""People have resigned themselves to the fact this is what's going on. They're still pretty supportive of the UAW,"" he said, but noted that depends how long the strike drags on.  ""The only frustrating part is we're not in control of this, so you have no idea when it's going to end.""",business
209,"Andrew Scheer promises to review mortgage 'stress test,' allow for longer mortgages","Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer is promising that, if he's elected, he'll review the so-called ""stress test"" to help first-time homebuyers get approved for mortgages and allow people to take out longer mortgages for lower monthly payments.  The stress test, introduced by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) last year, is a financial bar that any Canadian looking to take out a mortgage must pass.  It requires that prospective homebuyers prove they can service an uninsured mortgage at a higher rate than they qualify for, in order to receive a loan from a federally regulated lender. The idea is to protect borrowers from taking on more debt than they can handle and ensure they have some financial leeway if rates rise.  The Conservatives are promising to review the application of the test for new buyers and are vowing to work with OFSI to eliminate it altogether from mortgage renewals.  Scheer said the test goes too far and has unintended consequences.  ""A new Conservative government will fix the stress test to make sure first time homebuyers can get access to a mortgage,"" he said while unveiling a housing plan Monday during a campaign stop in Vaughan, Ont. about 40 kms north of Toronto.    CIBC published a report earlier this year calling for a review of the stress test. In 2018, the total value of new mortgages fell by eight per cent, or $25 billion, it said. The report estimates the impact of the new stress test accounted for $13 billion to $15 billion of that drop — or 50 to 60 per cent.  But Ben Rabidoux, president of the market research firm North Core Advisors, said getting OSFI to change course is out of the government's hands.  ""There's some concern any time a politician talks about leaning on an arm's-length financial regulator, because they are supposed to be independent,"" he said.  ""I think that there's a valid criticism around that one piece of the stress test, this idea that it creates these captive borrowers. But to the extent that the promise is, 'We're going to really lean on OSFI,' I just think that's a bad precedent and a really bad look.""  Amortization changes  Scheer said a Conservative government also would allow people to take out 30-year mortgages, up from the current 25-year limit.  ""It is important that we have strong regulations around the financial sector to ensure that our housing industry and our mortgage industry is strong and robust, but we believe that for first-time home buyers a 30-year amortization period is appropriate,"" he said.  ""Young first-time home buyers often have their highest earning years ahead of them. And so, as they get promoted and as their incomes go up, they'll be able to carry the mortgages that they've gotten into.""  Former prime minister Stephen Harper initially raised the CMHC's mortgage amortization period to 40 years in 2006, before shortening it to 35 years in 2008, reducing it again to 30 years in 2011 and returning it to 25 years again in 2012.   Former finance minister Jim Flaherty said at the time that he was making the change in an effort to encourage Canadians to borrow responsibly.   'There is no silver bullet here'  The Conservative Party is also promising to launch an inquiry into money laundering in the real estate sector and make surplus federal real estate available for development.  The moves drew praise from some industry associations.  The Canadian Real Estate Association said the longer mortgage element would ""ultimately [provide] greater flexibility for home buyers looking at financing to purchase a home of their own.""  The Canadian Home Builders' Association, which had been pushing for changes to the stress test, said the announcement would help ""well-qualified first-time buyers that have been locked out of home ownership in recent years.""  Rabidoux said the Conservatives' plan has some good ideas but it's not clear if it would change the housing scene in Canada.  James Laird the President of CanWise Financial, a mortgage broker, welcomed the changes, saying that changing the mortgage to a 30-year amortization will allow Canadians to pay 10 per cent more for a house without their mortgage payments increasing.   Laird also applauded the move to scrap the stress test from mortgage renewals, saying ""There was no logic to the existing lender not having a stress test and the new lender having a stress test.""     ""There's no silver bullet here. But I mean, this is kind of what you'd expect a politician to say. They don't really move the needle,"" he said.  The Liberals revealed their housing plan on the first full day of the campaign, pledging to expand the First Time Home Buyer Incentive program introduced with this year's budget.  The program is available to first-time homebuyers who earn less than $120,000 a year, but under the expanded program those with incomes up to $150,000 would qualify.  In February, the Liberals announced plans to turn surplus federal properties into new affordable housing.  ""Andrew Scheer's only plan is a reckless recipe to increase the debt of Canadian households — and to hurt families by taking money out of their pockets and cancelling the Liberal First-Time Home Buyer Incentive,"" said Eglinton-Lawrence Liberal candidate Marco Mendicino in a statement.",politics
210,What the attack on Saudi oil facilities could mean for Canada's oilpatch and Keystone XL,"The secure supply of Canadian oil to the United States could recapture the attention of American decision-makers following the recent attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities, experts say.     Industry and government leaders around the world are still assessing the impact of Saturday's drone strikes on the state-owned Saudi Aramco facilities.   The attack disrupted about five per cent of global crude supplies, sending oil prices soaring.  The news also saw Canadian energy stocks surge by double digits during Monday's trading amid concerns the impact on oil markets could last months.     Canadian crude — overshadowed by soaring U.S. shale oil production in recent years — could receive greater focus with renewed discussion about secure energy supplies, said Rory Johnston,  a commodity economist at Scotiabank.    ""Historically, we've seen more of the sentiment toward the Canadian oil sector as being couched in terms of oil security, which as a concept has kind of fallen by the wayside,"" Johnston said.   ""This will likely raise that energy security narrative back to the forefront of public discussion, which all else equal, should benefit the Canadian oilpatch as a source of secure supply — politically secure and right next door to the United States.""  While Canadian pipeline constraints make it difficult for oil companies to get more Alberta oil to market currently, Johnston said, a shift in the conversation could fuel further political pressure to build projects like Keystone XL, which has struggled in the face of legal, environmental and political challenges in the U.S.     Drone attack in Saudi Arabia hits world's largest oil processing facility    ""It wouldn't necessarily accelerate the timeline of these types of projects being built,"" he said.   ""I think what this does is just lessens the risk that we're going to see further delays.""  Alberta 'the most secure major source of energy': Kenney  Aberta Premier Jason Kenney, who was in New York on Monday to meet with institutional investors, also emphasized the message that Alberta is ""the most secure major source of energy"" in the world.  ""The strike on Saudi refineries should be a wake-up call,"" he posted to social media.  Kenney was also reported Monday to be looking at easing mandatory oil production cuts in Alberta following those attacks.  American interest in secure supplies of oil from Canada was particularly strong after the terror attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, said Christopher Sands, an expert on energy policy at Johns Hopkins University in Washington, D.C.    That changed during the Obama administration, he said, with greater emphasis on the environment.  Sands said the situation with Saudi Arabia may have Americans looking at Alberta, but it could underscore for some lawmakers how important it is Canada build on its own pipeline capacity and ensure security of its oil.  ""You don't have enough capacity, and this makes us think you need redundant capacity because what if something goes wrong?"" said Sands, adding that ensuring the security of existing energy infrastructure is key.  Tim McMillan, president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, said the current situation in Saudi Arabia may provide more incentive to expedite projects like Keystone XL and Enbridge's Line 3, which would carry more oil from Alberta to the U.S.     Expect to feel oil price spike at the gas pumps    But he added that even with President Donald Trump ""pushing these projects, it has been a challenge with the U.S. court system and some of the other delay tactics that opponents are using.""  Though McMillan said he's confident those projects will be built, he added he was ""less confident"" that the U.S. legal system will move any faster.  ""But why on earth is Canada so beholden to the United States when we have the world's second-largest coastlines, where we have a close connection to the growing markets in Asia?"" he added.    While Canadian producers still face challenges in getting oil to market, whether by pipeline or by rail, Ian Nieboer, managing director at RS Energy Group, said they should benefit from higher oil prices.   The question everyone is trying to answer, he said, is how long will the situation last.  ""The outage itself and its duration is probably the first and most pronounced fundamental impact,"" he said.  ""The longer term and more structural piece is, is there some sort of risk premium [on oil prices] that maybe enters the market as you think about the politics of the Middle East and now really the circumstances that led to this weekend's attack,"" Nieboer said.  As for gasoline prices, Roger McKnight, chief petroleum analyst at En-Pro International, says it likely means higher gasoline prices in Canada as early as Wednesday. He said it's unclear how long it's going to last.      We have no idea … where this thing is going to go because it's completely out of anyone's control.  - Roger McKnight, chief petroleum analyst at En-Pro International     ""We have no idea … where this thing is going to go because it's completely out of anyone's control,"" McKnight said.  ""And the Saudis are going to keep things kind of close to the vest because they don't want to really upset the market completely. But the facts are facts. Five per cent of crude supply goes off the market, and prices have to go up.""",business
211,Where are Thomas Cook travellers stranded? Here's how 17 countries are responding,"British travel operator Thomas Cook ran hotels, resorts and airlines ferrying 19 million people a year to locations all around the world. But it went bankrupt over the weekend, and since it currently has 600,000 people abroad, that has forced governments and insurance companies to co-ordinate a huge operation to bring them all home.  Here is a summary of official responses to the Thomas Cook collapse:  United Kingdom  The U.K.'s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and government has lined up flights in order to begin bringing an estimated 150,000 Britain-based customers back home from vacation spots around the globe in what was called the biggest peacetime repatriation effort in the country's history.  British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was traveling to New York for a meeting at the United Nations, said the government was right not to bail out the company, arguing that doing so could have led other businesses to expect the same treatment.   France  French organization Entreprises de Voyage said that about 10,000 French tourists could be affected by the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook.  Norway  Norwegian subsidiary Ving said that currently 8,685 Norwegians are on its tours.  The Norwegian Travel Guarantee Fund, an insurance scheme that is compulsory for tour operators, issued a statement saying it will ensure any passengers traveling with Thomas Cook's Norwegian unit will be repatriated.  Denmark  Danish subsidiary Spies said that none of its planes will be leaving, and about 1,400 travelers are affected. A press contact in Thomas Cook said that affected travelers will get their trips refunded.  Finland  Thomas Cook unit Tjäreborg said it has 2,884 passengers traveling. ""We are currently doing all we can to arrange return flights for passengers and will provide more information during the day,"" the company said on its website.  Sweden  The Swedish unit Ving said the number of Swedish passengers currently away came to 16,956. ""We are now working intensely to ensure that all affected travelers are flown home with as little disruption as possible,"" the company said on its website.  Russia  The Russian tour operator subsidiary Intourist expects the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook will have no impact on clients, Russian executive director Sergei Tolchin told Interfax.  Germany  Thomas Cook holiday airline Condor says it will continue its flight operation despite its parent company's insolvency.  ""Condor … is continuing operations,"" the German airline said in a statement.  Thomas Cook says there are roughly 140,000 vacationers currently traveling with its German units.  The Netherlands and Belgium  As of Monday morning, the Netherlands and Belgium units of Thomas Cook were still operating.  Poland  The Polish unit Neckermann said its financial condition is stable and it continues to operate normally, with holidayers unaffected.  Greece  A Greek tourism ministry official told Reuters that about 50,000 tourists are stranded.  ""The top priority now is to get them back home,"" the official said, declining to be named.  Cyprus  Cyprus's deputy minister for tourism said arrangements are underway to ferry back home the 15,000 Thomas Cook travellers — half being U.K. citizens, 40 per cent hailing from Scandinavian countries and the rest being from Germany — on the eastern Mediterranean island nation.  ""We will work intensively …. I believe that a large portion of the arrivals we stand to lose will somehow be regulated by the market and other travel agencies,"" said Savvas Perdios, deputy minister of tourism to Reuters.  The company's clients represent about six per cent of Cyprus's annual tourist arrivals, or around 250,000 people.  Spain  Spanish Airport operator Aena says 46 flights operated by Thomas Cook have been cancelled in Spanish airports. Between 25,000 and 30,000 tourists are affected in the Canary Islands, according to local media.  Turkey  The Turkish Ministry of Tourism said more than 21,000 stranded travellers are now in Turkish hotels.  The ministry tweeted Monday that guest payments were guaranteed by the U.K.'s Air Travel Organiser's Licence. The statement warned there would be legal proceedings against hotels demanding payment from guests or forcing them to leave.  The Hotelier Federation head said about 45,000 tourists from the UK and Europe are in the country.  Egypt  Thomas Cook operator Blue Sky Group said that 25,000 reservations in Egypt booked up to April 2020 had been cancelled. Blue Sky currently has 1,600 tourists in Egypt's Hugharda resort  Tunisia  Tunisian tourism minister Rene Trabelsi told Reuters that 4,500 Thomas Cook customers are still on holiday in Tunisia. Meanwhile, Tunisia's government offered assurances that Thomas Cook clients won't be prevented from leaving the country, following British media reports that the Les Orangers beach resort in Hammamet, near Tunis, initially refused to let Thomas Cook clients leave.  A British vacationer told BBC radio on Sunday that security guards shut the hotel's gates, for fear it wouldn't be paid what it is owed by Thomas Cook.    But Tunisia's Tourism Ministry, cited by Tunisia's TAP news agency, denied Sunday that British tourists were sequestered at a Hammamet hotel. It said instead that ""checkout procedures were delayed for a while at the request of the hotel keeper.""   It said the British group later checked out and flew home ""after being given apologies for the delay.""   Gambia  Gambian Tourism Minister Hamat Bah told The Associated Press the government convened an emergency meeting to deal with Thomas Cook's collapse. People in the tiny West African coastal nation say the shutdown could have a devastating impact on their tourism, which contributes more than 30 per cent of GDP.",business
212,"Anti-carbon-tax stickers falling off gas pumps, Ford vows to fix the problem","Ontario Premier Doug Ford says the government's provincewide campaign to criticize the federal carbon tax just isn't sticking.  That's because the stickers decrying the tax, which gas stations are required by law to post on their pumps, were produced using the wrong adhesive and are falling off.  Ford joked about the issue at the International Plowing Match in Verner, Ont., on Tuesday, quipping that the stickers may have worked if they'd been produced by the label company owned by the Ford family.    But the premier acknowledged that the stickers were somehow botched and vowed to fix the problem.  He says the specifications were all accurate for the stickers, which became mandatory in Ontario gas stations at the end of August.    He offered few details, but said he would be discussing the matter with Energy Minister Greg Rickford.  ""It's like the shoemaker's daughter not getting shoes,"" Ford said of the mixup. ""They have to pull me off the ceiling when I hear they are coming off.""  Ford jokes Deco Labels should have made stickers  Ford later joked that the issue wouldn't have surfaced if the stickers had been produced by Deco Labels and Tags, the company co-founded by the premier's father. He said he would have happily donated Deco's services to produce the stickers, but that he was not allowed to do so.  Rickford's office did not immediately respond to request for comment on the situation.    The stickers are part of an aggressive campaign to critique the federal carbon tax, which Ottawa imposed on Ontario earlier this year after the province failed to come up with its own comparable regime.  The stickers show the amount of money the carbon tax is expected to add to a tank of gas over the next three years, but makes no mention of rebates the feds have put in place to offset the impact.  Opponents of the sticker campaign have accused the government of spreading propaganda.  The Federal Carbon Tax Transparency Act, which took effect on Aug. 30, said gas station operators who refuse to post the stickers could face daily fines. Ontario's Chief Justice set the fine amount at $150 per day.  Earlier this month, the Canadian Civil Liberties Association launched a legal challenge of the law alleging it violates free speech provisions of the Constitution.",technology
213,Model Naomi Campbell takes spotlight at London Fashion Week,"Model Naomi Campbell took centre stage at London Fashion Week on Saturday night with a gala charity benefit at the impressive setting of the world famous British Museum.  The Campbell-hosted event was the latest ""Fashion for Relief"" fundraiser organized by the well-known model, whose efforts are supported by a wide array of friends and designers. The first charity show was in 2005 in support of victims of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans.    At the event, the British Museum's steps and foyer became a red carpet staging area for fashionable elite who passed the time drinking chilled champagne and margaritas while last minute checks were made on the models' makeup and outfits.  Campbell said this year's benefit was to raise funds to protect vulnerable children throughout the world and help provide education and skills development. The black-tie event drew a huge and enthusiastic crowd, including many who stayed for a private dinner after the runway performance.    Actor Pierce Brosnan and actress Naomie Harris were among the star contingent, and the show was supported by a wide array of global fashion houses including Gucci, McQueen, Marc Jacobs and Vivienne Westwood.  Some of the outfits were clearly meant to be over the top, including mens' looks that seemed to bare all: many outfits did not cover the chest and most of the tops were sheer. Double-breasted suits were meant to be worn without shirts and costumes paired white vinyl shorts with clear tops.    Women were given more variety, including floral jumpsuits, beautiful black, tight-fitting dresses, one dramatic black pantsuit with puffy pink sleeves and shoulders, and Conehead style veils. There were also spiky overcoats, kimono-inspired ensembles, Russian-styled Rasputin outfits for men and glittery silver elbow-length gloves.    The gala capped a warm day filled with shows and presentations, including runway offerings by Alexa Chung and House of Holland and millinery by master hatter Stephen Jones.  Chung attracts adoring fans  An early start couldn't deter Chung's legions of loyal fans, who flocked to a Saturday morning show which included outfits that offered variations on her classic feminine themes.  Chung greeted fans with a video message featuring a montage of what she described as ""AC World."" She described the new styles as ""clothes to feel empowered in"" with a theme of ""female solidarity"" and said they were designed to ""get over heartbreak.""    The TV personality also offered a pep talk to her mostly youthful audience. ""Enjoy life, kids,"" she said. ""It's great.""  The collection featured a number of longer coats, including belted variations. Some were worn over slip dresses or beautifully constructed longer dresses. The colours were muted, with many variations of green and gray, and Chung paid homage to the American West with a denim dress that seemed to conjure up open skies and endless vistas.    There was a well-tailored double-breasted suit and some 60s-style jumpsuits, but no sign of Dynasty-style shoulder pads or power-dressing. Chung doesn't do flash, but she couldn't resist a few faux-snakeskin pieces.  Models wore mostly light makeup and flowing hairstyles to allow for a style that looked simple, easy and elegant rather than fussy or overdone.  Big names are still coming up, with shows scheduled by Burberry, Victoria Beckham, Christopher Kane and Julien Macdonald as Fashion Week reaches its glittery climax.",entertainment
214,Trudeau says he never told candidate-vetting committee about blackface because he was embarrassed,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says that when the Liberal Party was vetting him as a candidate, he never owned up to  the documented cases of blackface in his personal history.   ""I never talked about this. Quite frankly, I was embarrassed,"" Trudeau told reporters in Winnipeg Thursday. ""It was not something that represents the person I've become, the leader I try to be and it was really embarrassing.""  Trudeau offered no further details on how he navigated the party's process for vetting candidates or how he continued to hide his embarrassing past.   According to the party's rules for vetting candidates, a qualified nomination contestant ""has a continuing obligation to disclose to the national campaign chair any information that could impact upon their acceptability as a qualified nomination contestant or as a candidate of the party.   ""Failure to disclose such information constitutes non-compliance with these rules … and may result in the disqualification of a qualified nomination contestant.""    Trudeau said he did not tell his staff about his history of blackface until Time magazine told him it was about to reveal that in 2001 he attended an Arabian Knights gala at a private school in B.C., where he was a teacher, dressed in a turban with his skin darkened. The story included a photo from a school yearbook.  ""Ultimately, the call is mine on when to talk to people, when to act on things, and the buck stops with me and I take responsibility,"" he said.   All parties vet candidates  In an effort to avoid embarrassments like Trudeau's, candidates for all parties are vetted to unearth anything that could possibly derail their campaign or hurt the party.   The Liberal Party says its ""Greenlight Committee"" scrutinizes each prospective candidate to ensure a clean slate and its rules stipulate that candidates must not have ""engaged in any claim, litigation or dispute of any sort which is liable to bring controversy or disrepute upon the qualified nomination contestant or the party.""  Kaveh Shahrooz failed to secure the Liberal nomination for the Toronto-area riding of Richmond Hill in the 2015 federal election, losing out to Majid Jowhari, who went on to win the seat.       We don't have people going to campuses. That just doesn't happen.  - Michele Cadario     Shahrooz told CBC News that the committee had him fill out an extensive questionnaire detailing his background, views, education and financial information. After that, researchers for the party reviewed his social media history and then conducted a telephone interview.   ""Something like an old yearbook? I don't think that would have been caught in that greenlight process,"" said Shahrooz. ""If they don't offer up the information, I don't think that vetting 338 candidates it's possible to go and look at everyone's old yearbooks. At the candidate level it's hard to do.""  From vetting to crisis management  Jowhari may have won his seat, but within a year he was forced to apologize for misrepresenting his professional credentials as an engineer during the campaign. While he had qualified as an engineer, he was no longer licensed. To make amends he had to apologize and donate $5,000 to the Ontario Professional Engineers Foundation for Education.  Michele Cadario, the former federal campaign director for Paul Martin, helped oversee the vetting process for Martin's prime ministerial campaign. She said that unless a candidate freely reveals they have an embarrassing incident in their past that would not be picked up with a social media search, credit check or internet search, it's very hard to get a complete picture.   ""Unless something got flagged in that research. The idea of tracking down a yearbook or a newsletter or anything that's written, unless it's anything that's like a published article or a published book, or anything like that which would absolutely be read, but we don't have people going to campuses. That just doesn't happen.""    Cadario said that all issues that arise in vetting are dealt with on a case-by-case basis. If, for example, someone made a racist comment a year ago on social media, it would be treated differently than a drunk-driving conviction that was decades old and where candidate had worked hard to make amends.   ""We have a candidate survey that's fairly exhaustive that they have to go through,"" she said. "" A lot of it is based on asking them what they have been involved in, and what they've done and would be embarrassing to the party. We wanted them to acknowledge it.""  Cadario said that when candidates do not reveal past transgressions, such as Trudeau's blackface incidents, and those incidents are revealed after the candidate has been elected, it is no longer about vetting. The issue then becomes crisis management.",politics

217,"U.K. tour operator Thomas Cook collapses, cancels all bookings","Veteran U.K. tour operator Thomas Cook has collapsed after failing to secure rescue funding, and travel bookings for its more than 600,000 global vacationers were cancelled early Monday.  The U.K. government said the return of the firm's 150,000 British customers now abroad would be the largest repatriation in its peacetime history. On Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said they have already begun a ""huge effort"" to bring home stranded tourists and passengers. He said future steps need to be taken so ""you don't end up with a situation where the taxpayer, where the state is having to step in and bring people home.""  The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said Thomas Cook has ceased trading, its four airlines will be grounded, and its 21,000 employees in 16 countries, including 9,000 in the UK, will lose their jobs.     Britain's CAA said it had arranged an aircraft fleet for the complex British repatriation effort, which is expected to last two weeks.  ""Due to the significant scale of the situation, some disruption is inevitable, but the CAA will endeavour to get people home as close as possible to their planned dates,"" the aviation authority said in a statement.  The 178-year-old company said Friday it was seeking £200 million ($331 million Cdn) in emergency funds to avoid going bust, and was in weekend talks with shareholders and creditors to stave off failure. The prominent firm, whose airliners were a familiar sight in many parts of the world, also operated around 600 U.K. travel stores.  Thomas Cook's struggle to adapt  Thomas Cook, which began in 1841 with a one-day train excursion in England and now operates in 16 countries, has been struggling over the past few years. It only recently raised £900 million ($1.5 billion), including receiving money from leading Chinese shareholder Fosun.  Analysts said Thomas Cook, which rode a package holiday boom that started in the mid-1980s, was too slow to react as consumers moved away from buying trips at bricks-and-mortar stores.   It has been overtaken by online services like Airbnb and internet travel companies who may separate or combine hotel, rental car and flight offerings, which puts pressure on prices through comparison shopping.   ""The company has struggled to adapt to a changing travel and retail environment,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK.   The company did push into online business, with 48 per cent of its bookings from the internet as of last year. But it wasn't fast enough. Online rivals didn't have to bear the costs of owning 200 hotels, 500 travel agency shops and 105 airline jets, but acted as middlemen.    Thomas Cook Group PLC isn't alone in facing such pressures. Competitor TUI Group AG, based in Hannover, Germany, has shifted its focus from tour operators to its own cruises and hotels.   But other factors laid into the British travel company.   Company officials have cited uncertainty over Brexit, both from consumers worried about its impact on their finances and from the timing, given that one unfulfilled deadline for Britain to leave the EU fell on March 31, just days before the heavy European Easter holiday travel season this year. Travel agents had to issue guidance on what would happen in case of a no-deal Brexit.  Brexit has meanwhile sent the pound lower, giving British travellers less purchasing power.     As the company struggled to reshape its business in the new environment and cut costs, it was hit with an unusually warm summer in 2018, which it said led travellers from the U.K. and Scandinavia to put off plans to head for warmer destinations. When they did decide at the last minute, the sector of the market that focuses on late decision makers turned out to be fiercely competitive on price.  ""The group, like its peers, has suffered from a perfect storm of turbulence, from political unrest and terrorism at some of its most popular destinations, to unusual weather patterns seeing travellers taking 'staycations' and the ever-present Brexit uncertainty devaluing the pound and putting consumers off from booking holidays,"" said Helal Miah, investment research analyst at The Share Centre.   In May, the company reported a debt burden of £1.25 billion ($2.07 billion), which gave the company less breathing room to manoeuvre.  ""While other travel groups have suffered from these factors, Thomas Cook's pile of debt is the differentiating factor,"" said Miah.  Most of Thomas Cook's British customers are protected by the government-run travel insurance program, which makes sure vacationers can get home if a British-based tour operator fails while they are abroad.  Like 'being held hostage'  The company's troubles had already started to affect those travelling under the Thomas Cook banner before the firm announced its collapse.  A British vacationer also told BBC Radio on Sunday that the Les Orangers beach resort in the Tunisian town of Hammamet, near Tunis, demanded that guests who were about to leave pay extra money for fear it wouldn't be paid what it is owed by Thomas Cook.  Ryan Farmer, of Leicestershire, said many tourists refused the demand, since they had already paid Thomas Cook, so security guards shut the hotel's gates and ""were not allowing anyone to leave.""  It was like ""being held hostage,"" said Farmer, who is due to leave Tuesday. He said he would also refuse to pay if the hotel asked him.  The Associated Press called the hotel, as well as the British Embassy in Tunis, but no officials or managers were available for comment.  Julie Robsson and her seven friends are due to fly out of Spain on a chartered Titan Airways plane to Manchester following the cancellation of their Thomas Cook flight earlier in the day.  The 58-year-old retiree from Yorkshire was ending a weeklong holiday on the Balearic Islands, about 250 kilometres south of Barcelona, and part of a group of some 300 tourists who were waiting on Monday for replacement flights.    Robsson said she was satisfied with the information received on the ground from the CAA and the British Consulate in Palma, the capital of the autonomous Spanish archipelago, but Thomas Cook's representative had not appeared in the group's hotel since the first rumours of the financial difficulties emerged last week.  ""I'm quite sad because it's an old company. The prices were all reasonable. The planes were clean,"" Robsson said, adding that after having used Thomas Cook's services for package holidays in Spain, Greece, Mexico and India, she was considering other alternatives now.",business
218,"Researchers using drones to document, study impact of Dorian on P.E.I. ","Researchers with the UPEI Climate Lab are using drone technology to get a rare glimpse from high above the devastation caused by Dorian.  The drone is capturing stunning images and videos of damage to Cavendish Campground, Cavendish's main beach and farms across the province after the post-tropical storm devastated Prince Edward Island last weekend and knocked out power for many communities.  ""If something terrible like this is going to happen anyway, we should take advantage as a learning opportunity and I think most importantly, is find out as much data as we can on the impact,"" said Stephanie Arnold, lead researcher with the lab.  ""So that we can make ourselves more resilient by preventing those impacts or at least lessening the damage of those impacts.""  Drones have been in the air at various locations across the Island to allow researchers to quickly — and safely — assess damage from the storm.    ""We're trying to capture as many footage as we can of the storm so that we can help farmers and the parks manage the aftermath,"" Arnold said. ""There's only so many flying days that we have, so we have all of our teams out flying as much as we can all over the Island.""  Arnold said while the view from the ground after a devastating storm like Dorian is heartbreaking, it's the view from the sky that's more revealing, particularly in Cavendish Beach in P.E.I. National Park.  ""The dunes look completely different,"" Arnold said. ""A lot of them, it looks like it was sheared right off, it was just a straight shear as opposed to a nice, soft dune.""    Staff have also been using the drones to survey damage to crops done by Dorian.   Information collected by the team will be shared with Parks Canada and farmers to help them adapt to extreme weather events and the impacts that storms like Dorian can have.    ""There are scientists working on creating new varieties,"" said Arnold. ""In the meantime, I'm also looking at how we can maybe manage our farm practices a little bit differently to prepare for really extreme weather events. There is some ways, maybe managing water. It's something we have to get better at just because the extremes are going to swing so widely and it's so unpredictable that it's not going to be easy.""  Researchers said they plan to do a before and after comparison of Cavendish Campground and the main beach.    ""We've captured footage of Cavendish main beach prior and now we have one for after,"" Arnold said. ""We have some before and after of farms as well. We've been so busy flying drones that we haven't had time in the office to do the analysis yet, but we're all very interested in how we can assess the damage.""    The research team will also fly over agricultural fields in Kings County to see if the rain caused any wash outs.  ""It's never fun to do post-storm assessment, but the fact that we have drones that we can use to gather data, it really helps us take a look at coastal changes, changes on farms and other ways of really better managing and preparing for weather events like this,"" Arnold said.

219,Maxime Bernier says addressing Indigenous water issues a 'first priority' if elected,"The leader of the People's Party of Canada says if his party gets elected, one of the first issues it will tackle is addressing boil water advisory issues in Indigenous communities across the country.  Maxime Bernier was in northern Ontario on Saturday to visit the International Plowing Match and campaign with Nipissing-Timiskaming candidate Mark King.  According to Indigenous Services Canada, 56 advisories remain in place across the country.  Bernier says he doesn't believe it's a matter of money to get the problem fixed.  ""The federal government is spending for First Nations about $20 billion a year. We'll keep that budget,"" he said.  ""But we will work with First Nations, with people on the reserve [as] they have the solution to that. The solution is not coming from Ottawa. Let's work with them. It's a question of bureaucracy. It's a question of bureaucrats not being efficient. It's not a problem of money. It's a problem of process and approving these projects.""    Bernier also spoke about other policies in his party's platform. He says his platform includes a plan to address Canada's labour shortage.  ""The solution is not only immigration, the solution is also automatization,"" he said.  ""We will abolish corporate welfare. We'll save $5 million there. But at the same time, we will have a flat tax on business at 10 per cent. We will abolish the capital gain tax in this country. The business entrepreneur will have more money in their pockets.""  Bernier says the changes would result in businesses having more money, meaning their workers could be paid more.  He also added that he plans to reduce the number of immigrants being allowed into the country, adding the screening process would be changed.  ""We want these people to integrate into our society,"" he said.  ""We want to be sure to have a face to face interview with these people, with every newcomer that will come to this country.

220,'The person that would change things': Montreal jazz icon Vic Vogel dies at 84,"Legendary Canadian jazz musician Vic Vogel has died at the age of 84.   He passed early Monday morning at his home in Montreal, next to his Steinway piano, which he had played since he was 16, according to a post on his Facebook page.  Victor Stefan Vogel, who became a pianist, conductor, composer, arranger and trombonist, was born in Montreal on Aug. 3, 1935.  ""Jazz is the thing I love,"" Vogel told Radio-Canada in a 1960s interview. ""It's powerful; it's alive. It's so much fun; it's interesting — ah!""   His work includes more than 2,000 pieces, arrangements and compositions; his name is on more than 60 albums, and he has given more than 10,000 performances.   Vogel is remembered by his friend and fellow prominent Montreal jazz musician Oliver Jones as ""a very unique musician who deserved an awful lot of respect.""    Mostly self-taught  ""He had some training, but most of everything he figured out on his own,"" Jones told Sabrina Marandola, host of CBC Montreal's Let's Go radio program. ""It's not easy in the jazz world.""  Jones met Vogel when he was 15 and Vogel was 14, when they were both accompanying singers and tap dancers at a local YMCA.   ""From that point on we were close friends for many many years,"" Jones said. ""I just thought the world of him as one of our greatest musicians.""    The ever-colourful bandleader was a fixture on the city's music scene for decades, playing at almost every Montreal International Jazz Festival, including the very first one in 1980.  A musician with a public profile since the age of 14, Vogel was mostly self-taught. He played in several dance orchestras in the 1950s, eventually conducting his own musical ensemble in 1960 at Club Chez Parée.     He then toured with the Parisian vocal group Les Doubles Six in 1961 and later, the Société Radio-Canada's jazz orchestra in 1966.   In 1968, he founded The Big Jazz Band, which he conducted for more than 50 years.   The album Vic Vogel and the Awesome Big Band entered the American Billboard chart in 1987.   Jones said Vogel was unafraid to forge new paths in music and always wanted to do something ""a little bit different.""  ""Vic was the person that would change things and end up doing something completely new for the first time,"" Jones said. ""He was very very unique as far as writing.""     ""I know there will always be a time when we'll say, 'I wish Vic was here to do this,'"" Jones said, offering his condolences to Vogel's family and friends.   Vogel shared the stage with more than 2,000 artists, among them some of the legendary musicians of all time.   They include Paul Anka, Sammy Davis Jr., Édith Piaf, Celine Dion, Michel Legrand, Jerry Lewis, Chucho Valdés, Maynard Ferguson, Oscar Peterson, Ella Fitzgerald, Phil Wood, Gerry Mulligan, Mel Tormé and Dizzy Gillespie.  In 2005, Vogel represented the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation as the European Broadcasting Union named him to compose, arrange and conduct the European Youth Jazz Orchestra, with which he toured in Europe and recorded an album in tribute to Oscar Peterson's 80th birthday.    Concordia University presented Vogel with an honorary doctorate in 2010, calling him a ""premiere musician and key force in establishing Montreal as a world jazz capital.""  ""I'm flabbergasted,"" he told CBC Montreal's evening radio program Homerun in 2010. ""Being a bit of a rebel all my life, I guess it's a way that society is accepting me into their folds, which is quite an honour.""  Vogel had a special affinity for Cuba, and Cuban music. In 2008, he told Homerun he would collect pianos and other instruments to send them to Cuba after large areas of the island sustained damage from hurricanes Gustav and Ike.",entertainment

222,"Liberals promise improved access to family doctors, mental health care and prescription drugs","The Liberals are promising to ensure all Canadians have access to a family doctor, mental health services and prescription drugs, but have released few details about how a re-elected Liberal government would implement a national pharmacare program or how much it would cost.  Promising to take the ""critical next steps"" toward a national pharmacare program, party background materials released to journalists say the Liberals are seeking a mandate to design and implement such a program and would negotiate with the provinces and territories to improve health care outcomes.  Holding a campaign event in Hamilton, Ont., Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau said Liberals ""believe in"" universal pharmacare as laid out by the advisory council report commissioned by his government. But he said it's not a decision for the federal government alone; it requires partnerships and negotiations across provinces and territories.  He took sharp aim at Ontario Premier Doug Ford and his cuts to health care programs, billing himself as the best leader to stand tough against Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer's provincial cousin through those negotiations.  ""So the question becomes for Canadians, 'Who do you want negotiating with Doug Ford when it comes to your health?'"" he said.    Ford's office said this year's provincial budget increased health spending by $1.3 billion.  ""He wants to change the channel from his situation he's facing and he's busy campaigning and that's fine. I'm busy governing and we're doing a great job turning this province around and putting money back into people's pockets and creating 230,000 jobs in the last year and four months,"" Ford told CBC News in Toronto.  ""So he can continue doing that. I'm going to continue focusing on the province.""    A statement from Ford's press secretary Ivana Yelich said it's ""categorically untrue"" to say Ford's government is cutting health care and insisted that his government has made landmark investments in health care and mental health services.  ""Premier Ford, along with his provincial and territorial counterparts, has asked the federal government to do its fair share to put patients first and strengthen our provincial health care systems across Canada by increasing the growth rate of the Canada Health Transfer to 5.2 per cent annually,"" she said.  ""We look forward to working with the federal government to ensure Ontario gets a fair and adequate share of the funding to support our province's health care needs.""    Scheer shot back that Trudeau would continue to run the country's finances as unpopular former Liberal premier of Ontario Kathleen Wynne did, and suggested that Trudeau is trying to deflect from his own record of big deficits and scandal.  ""He's desperate to run against anyone other than me,"" he said during a campaign event in Vaughan, Ont.  Scheer said a Conservative government would increase transfers for health and education by three per cent and accused Trudeau of lying to Canadians about his party's positions.  Council recommended universal pharmacare  In June, an advisory council appointed by the Liberal government recommended the establishment of a universal, single-payer public pharmacare system.  The council's 171-page report called for the creation of a new drug agency that would draft a national list of prescription medicines that would be covered by the taxpayer, beginning with an initial list of common and essential drugs, by Jan. 1, 2022.  The council recommended that the initial list be expanded to a comprehensive plan by Jan. 2, 2027. When fully implemented, the total cost would be about $15 billion a year, the council said.    Dr. Eric Hoskins, a former Ontario health minister and chair of the advisory council, acknowledged at the time there are ""significant incremental costs"" to building a pharmacare program, but he noted that those costs are already being picked up by Canadians.  The Liberal backgrounder released Monday with Trudeau's announcement says a re-elected Liberal government would also commit to establishing the Canada Drug Agency to make drug purchasing ""more effective and efficient,"" implement a national formulary with provinces, territories and other stakeholders to lower drug prices, and introduce a rare disease drug strategy to help Canadian families save money on high-cost drugs.  Drug pricing changes on the way  The federal government is also making changes to the way it will evaluate new drug prices in a move to try to save Canadians billions of dollars over the next 10 years.  In August, the government released changes to the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board, first set up in 1987 as a shield against high drug prices, which are set to kick in next July.  Under the new regulations, the board will no longer compare prices with the United States and Switzerland (which have some of the world's highest drug prices) when figuring out what companies are allowed to charge. It will still compare drug prices to France, Germany and Italy, and has added Japan, Spain, Norway, Australia, Belgium and the Netherlands to the list.    The Liberal health care platform also pledges to set clear standards for access to mental health services, and improve access to homecare and palliative care.  ""Every Canadian, no matter where they live, who they are or what they do, should receive the care they need to stay healthy,"" Trudeau said.  The Liberal Party says these measures would represent a $6 billion federal investment — what it calls an ""additional down payment"" — with details related to costing to be released ""over the course of the campaign.""  The Liberal Party has been criticized for not having every platform promise costed and publicly released by the Parliamentary Budget Officer, as the Conservative Party and NDP have done.    Today, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said the current system, which can diagnose a patient without offering subsidized medication, is ""illogical"" and ""irrational."" He said an NDP government would bring in a universal pharmacare program within just one year.  ""We've got the courage to take on big pharma. We've got the courage to take on the big insurance companies that don't want this program. But we know it's doable and it's so important,"" he said.  While Trudeau appeared to hedge on the exact model of pharmacare that would ultimately be adopted, Linda Silas, president of the Canadian Federation of Nurses Unions, took from the announcement that Liberals would bring in a universal program, rather than a limited one. She said access to prescription medication should be guaranteed, just like access to hospitals and doctors.    ""As nurses, we've been advocating for universal pharmacare for decades, because we see first-hand how our patients are suffering and how our system is squandering precious resources that could be reinvested in home care, long-term care, primary care, mental health and acute care,"" said Silas in a statement.  ""Study after study has confirmed universal drug coverage is the most efficient, economical and equitable option for Canada.""",health
223,Stratford cyberattack costs $75K in bitcoin,"The city of Stratford agreed to pay an attacker more than $75,000 worth of Bitcoin in exchange for decryption keys to unlock its information systems following an April cyber attack.   According to an information update on the Stratford website, the city paid the attacker 10 Bitcoin — a digital form of currency — which was then valued at $7,509.13 each.  The city said it has submitted a cyber insurance claim, which should foot most of the bill. The city's deductible is $15,000.  The cyber attack happened on April 14, after an attacker installed malware on six physical servers and two virtual ones. The city didn't return to normal business operations until April 29.  An investigation by the consulting company Deloitte found that no personal information was lost or disclosed as a result of the attack.  The city said it has since beefed up its security measures to prevent another attack from happening.  A police investigation into the cyber attack continues.",technology
224,Ontario teen was on life-support after respiratory illness linked to vaping,"An Ontario teenager was put on life-support after using a vaping device in what public health officials say is the first reported case of illness linked to the practice in Canada.  Officials with the Middlesex-London Health Unit were alerted by a local doctor after the high school student fell ill and was sent to hospital.  ""The individual was using e-cigarettes at least daily,"" said Dr. Chris Mackie, the region's medical officer of health.  ""We have information about the brand used.""  That information is not being released but has been passed to Canada's chief medical officer of health who will be gathering systematic data to determine if one vaping device is more potent than another.  ""We're not releasing information about the brand information because that would imply that this is something coming from one brand, when clearly looking at the international evidence, that's not the case,"" Mackie said.  Mackie said the teen has been released from hospital and is doing well.      It's important that people understand vaping does create health risks.  - Dr. Chris Mackie     ""There are some who claim that vaping is not a risk in Canada,"" he said. ""That is not the case. It's important that people understand vaping does create health risks.""  There have been hundreds of such cases in the United States, but this is believed to be the first case of severe pulmonary illness linked to vaping in Canada.   ""We know very little about the long-term health effects associated with e-cigarettes, but our findings so far are enough to convince us of the need to advise the public,"" Mackie said.  Mackie did caution that it's impossible to 100 per cent confirm the youth's illness was caused by vaping, but said there was no other evidence to suggest it was caused by something else.     ""There was no other cause — no infectious cause,"" he said. ""The only issue identified is that the individual vaped e-cigarettes.  The health unit says it will not disclose the age, gender or hometown of the patient, claiming confidentiality.   The news comes on the same day as the Ontario health minister ordered public hospitals to report vaping-related cases of severe pulmonary disease.   Use 'escalating' among youth  It also follows a directive from Health Canada to health-care professionals, telling them to ask patients about their vaping use and if they have any trouble breathing or shortness of breath.   ""The use of these products is escalating at a rate we've never seen,"" said Linda Stobo, the Middlesex-London Health Unit's manager of chronic disease prevention and tobacco control team. ""Our enforcement officers have seen an exponential increase in the number of students who vape, particularly high school-aged youth, which is a major concern for us.""   Stobo said the e-cigarettes are marketed in a way that targets a young demographic including:     Sleek designs with options to customize the look, including different colours.   Hundreds of flavours of e-juice, including candy, designed to attract youth.    Marketing that uses words such as ""bold,"" ""stylish,"" ""attractive"" and ""try it.""   Some vaping devices can be charged using a computer or cellphone charger, making them enticing to a generation already enamoured with technology.     Stobo also said she's worried about the high concentrations of nicotine found in some of the products. She also said local schools are reporting students vaping in washrooms, classrooms and even buses.    Selling vaping products to those under 18 isn't allowed in Canada, but Health Canada wants to strengthen rules to limit the visibility of vaping ads to young people.   Some proponents of vaping insist it can be an effective way to prevent people from smoking tobacco, or a way to help smokers quit cigarettes.     Mackie, however, said it can often work the other way. That someone not interested in smoking may start with vaping then transfer over to cigarettes because they're cheaper.    ""If you start people on smoking e-juice … then when they run out of money the smoking behaviour starts up,"" he said.   In the United States, there have been hundreds of cases of respiratory illnesses linked to vaping and at least seven deaths. Many of those deaths were linked to vaping cannabis. Mackie wouldn't say whether cannabis was a factor in the London, Ont., case.     ""The information we have … is that there's no particular brand that has been implicated, and there's no particular link with cannabis or not,"" he said. ""There are cases where cannabis has been involved and cases where it hasn't been.   India on Wednesday moved to ban the production, import and sale of electronic cigarettes.  However, the London-Middlesex case is believed to be the first reported in Canada.",health
225,Toronto approves strategy to combat anti-vaccination as parents accuse city of 'genocide',"Tensions flared at Toronto city hall on Monday as a large group of anti-vaccination parents protested against the city's decision to adopt a new vaccination strategy.  The recommendation by Dr. Eileen de Villa, Toronto's medical officer of health, calls for a new public health strategy to address ""vaccine hesitancy."" It includes a proposal that would prevent students from skipping vaccines for non-medical reasons.  The growing movement against vaccines includes the reluctance or refusal to vaccinate due to concerns about possible side effects, including serious injuries and death.  Most of the recommendations will need to be approved by the provincial and federal governments.  The City of Toronto estimates that around 20 per cent of parents in the city are vaccine hesitant.  On Monday morning, the plan to combat that trend was unanimously approved by the Board of Health.   The decision came after several Toronto residents vociferously demanded that the board reject the plan due to concerns that vaccinations are dangerous.    'My body, my choice'  People attending the meeting shouted ""shame"" and ""genocide"" after the vote was taken.  ""I do not consent to having myself nor my children force-vaccinated, drugged and medically induced in order to attend public schools in Canada,"" said Emanuela Caires during her deputation.  ""I am not willing to subject this type of harm over benign childhood illnesses,"" added the mother of three unvaccinated children.  Catherine Condinho, an unvaccinated student, said the plan would take away her freedom of conscience and religion.  ""This is my body, my choice,"" she said to the cheers of supporters, who filled the meeting room and city hall's atrium.    De Villa's report includes a range of recommendations to ""improve vaccine acceptance,"" including removing exemptions, improving digital immunization records and developing a vaccine injury compensation fund.  The case for vaccinations  ""Vaccines work, full stop,"" said Board of Health chair Joe Cressy. ""There is an abundance of scientifically proven evidence demonstrating just that.""  Most medical experts consider vaccinations safe and effective at preventing the spread of many harmful illnesses.    ""Vaccination is one of the world's greatest public-health achievements, along with sanitation, antibiotics and clean drinking water,"" according to Health Canada.  Cressy pointed to recent measles outbreaks in Canada, the United States and Europe as proof that vaccine hesitancy has potentially dangerous outcomes.  He said the plan will help Toronto prevent similar outbreaks, rather than reacting to them after they occur.  ""People have the fundamental right to believe what they want, but they do not have the right to endanger others,"" Cressy added.    Last year, 1.72 per cent of Toronto students did not receive mumps and rubella vaccines due to philosophical and religious exemptions, up from 0.8 per cent in 2007.  While answering questions from board members, de Villa acknowledged that serious reactions can occur after vaccines are administered, though those instances are rare.  ""That doesn't take away from the fact that [vaccines] are one of the most significant life-saving interventions that has occurred in medical history,"" she said.  While the recommendations were unanimously approved Monday, the provincial government previously indicated that it has no plans to update provincial regulations.  Under the Immunization of School Pupils Act, children are required to have proof of immunization for certain diseases to attend school in Ontario, unless there is a ""valid medical exemption or affidavit of conscience or religious belief,"" said health ministry spokesperson Travis Kann.",health
226,Next frontier in medical fundraising? Toronto man turns to boot camp to help raise $3M for son's rare disorder,"The latest stop in Terry Pirovolakis's journey to cure his son's rare genetic disorder is a boot camp: an intense, all-day session on how to win grants to fund expensive medical research.  It has now become part of how the Pirovolakis care for 21-month-old Michael.  There are the conventional appointments, like physio and occupational therapy. But the disease their son has is so rare and there is no treatment, leaving his parents with only one choice: to fund research to find a cure themselves — at a cost of about $3 million.  Michael Pirovolakis is believed to be the only child in Canada diagnosed with spastic paraplegia type 50, or SPG50, a disorder caused by a missing gene.  It threatens to degenerate the toddler's brain, which could rob him of his ability to move, speak and even breathe. But gene therapy may be able to halt — maybe even reverse — the degeneration that has already set in.    There are only 57 known cases of SPG50 in the world, including Michael, according to pediatric neurologists at Boston Children's Hospital.  This week, Terry Pirovolakis was in San Diego at conference called the Global Genes Summit, learning how to raise the money he needs to fund a clinical trial.  ""If we're going to make $3 million, we need support, we need to hear from experts that have raised $20, $40, $50 million,"" he said. ""How they did it, what worked, what didn't. We almost have to become experts at fundraising.""  Community help  The Pirovolakis, who live in Toronto, have already become adept in community fundraising. Michael was diagnosed with SPG50 in April, and since then, the family has raised thousands by liquidating their savings, as well as through public events and donations via GoFundMe.  Their community has held all kinds of fundraisers big and small; their neighbourhood is blanketed in signs raising awareness of the cause.  ""[It] makes us hopeful and shows us how good people can be. The generosity is amazing,"" said Michael's mother, Georgia Pirovolakis.  People show up the the Pirovolakis's door with cash and cheques. One little girl brought her tooth fairy money. Other children have donated their allowances and set up lemonade stands.    ""The cutest is the little kids,"" Georgia said. ""It was just so heartwarming to see.  ""To see little kids helping little kids is just amazing. To those parents raising the children, I give them nothing but thanks and props for being such amazing parents and sharing the love and teaching them that they should help and give back.""  While the family tries to overcome the daunting hurdle of raising millions, the biggest enemy is actually time. The longer it takes for the treatment to be funded, the greater the risk Michael will lose the ability to move. It's why his parents are trying every avenue to raise the money.    The boot camp Terry Pirovolakis attended at the Global Genes Summit showed participants how to write proposals to get funding from foundations. It also covered partnering with companies and legal matters, including managing intellectual property.  The broader conference focused on networking, with sessions geared to helping patients and their families push research forward. There were workshops titled ""Rare Disease Research: Getting Your Disease Noticed"" and ""Developing Partnerships Among Rare Communities and Individual.""  The clinical trial  The money raised by the Pirovolakis so far — about $665,000 — is funding the first phases of a clinical trial at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, Texas.  Researchers there have created a virus that will transport that missing gene to Michael's brain. It could cure him, they say, but more testing needs to be done. So more money is needed.    Without parents fundraising to get treatments for rare diseases, the research ""just wouldn't get done,"" said Steven Gray, an associate professor and researcher at UT Southwestern Medical Center.  ""This is the only way that things move forward for a rare disease,"" said Gray. ""It makes it very personal for me and makes it worthwhile for us to go in the lab every day and do what we do.""  'Willing to go anywhere'  ""I'm willing to go anywhere,"" Terry Pirovolakis said. ""From the very beginning of this journey, I told the doctors I'm willing to do anything, give up everything, if I have to. And this is part of that journey.""  For now, what is keeping Terry going is imagining the day when they've raised enough money and Michael gets the experimental treatment.  ""I envision that day, yes,"" he said, choking back tears. ""And then that moment after, where he does the hard work to gain the stuff he's lost. Absolutely.""    Georgia Pirovolakis says it's sometimes harder for her to visualize that day, as she watches her son struggle through all the different therapy appointments.  ""I have days where I can't see it. Because I'm with him all the time, and I see him struggle, and I see him trying so hard. And sometimes it's hard for me to envision that moment,"" she said.  ""Terry is more positive than me, but $3 million is a long way away. I hope it comes, I pray it comes. But when will it come, right?  ""We'll get there. We'll get there.""",health
227,Sleep congress shines light on women's struggle with insomnia ,"Frustration: that's the word Vancouverite Jacqueline Sinclair uses most often to describe her insomnia.   There's the frustration of lying in bed, awake in the middle of the night, knowing how crappy she'll feel the next day. The frustration of struggling to relax as she lies awake. And the frustration of failing at what should be a basic life skill.   ""Knowing that the rest of the world is able to do something as simple as sleep ... it's frustrating,"" said Sinclair, 50, who works from home doing administration for the family's construction business.  Sleep has eluded Sinclair for the past 10 years. As remedies, she has cut out caffeine, sugar and gluten. She has tried herbal teas, homeopathy and vitamins. CBD oil and prescription sleeping pills have been helpful, but they each had worrisome side effects.   ""I'm not sure what's next,"" she said. ""I hope I go to bed tonight and sleep for six hours straight. Wouldn't that be fantastic?""    Dr. Ram Randhawa, a psychiatrist at the University of British Columbia's Sleep Disorders Program, says about 30 per cent of Canadians struggle with getting to or staying sleep at any given time. The prevalence of insomnia does seem to be higher among women, he said.  For most people, sleep issues are a temporary problem brought on by stress or worry. For some, they can be a debilitating, life-long problem.     Increasingly, doctors and sleep experts recognize that insomnia and other sleep disorders affect women and men differently. At the World Sleep Congress in Vancouver this week, women and sleep is one of a handful of key topics.   Dr. Ghada Bourjeily, a professor of medicine at Brown University in Rhode Island and chair of the course on sleep health for women at the conference, says women have historically been underrepresented in medical research, including research on sleep disorders.    Women face unique biological circumstances that can disrupt sleep at different times in their lives, Bourjeily says — beginning when they get their periods, to when they become pregnant and eventually go through menopause.   ""There's a lot that we seem to be learning about these things,"" she said.    Deeper understanding  Randhawa, with UBC's Sleep Disorders Program, will also be presenting at the conference.   He says UBC's sleep clinic has a long wait list of people eager to get help, and many of them are women who have trouble falling or staying asleep.   He agrees that sleep issues manifest differently in men and women. While sleep apnea is more likely to affect men, for example, women are more prone to conditions that can affect sleep like restless leg syndrome, anxiety and depression.    Randhawa says it's important for doctors to develop a well-rounded profile of a patient's circumstances and the problems they face, including family pressures like child-rearing and housework.   ""If I can develop a better understanding of that particular person's issue of what it is that they are struggling with, and how that has affected them, that will allow me to help them better,"" he said.  Randhawa says women who attend his clinic can also request one of three female psychiatrists who work there, if they prefer someone they think might be more understanding of their situation.    Validating patients' concerns  Lianne Tomfohr-Madsen, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Calgary who will present her research on insomnia and pregnancy at the congress, says some doctors can be dismissive of women's sleep issues.  Tomfohr-Madsen is working to help doctors differentiate between normal sleep disturbances during pregnancy, like physical discomfort and frequent nighttime urination, from more serious issues.   ""We often aren't differentiating what those normal changes look like from what's actually really clinically significant and bothersome to women,"" she said    Some pregnant women feel disregarded when they discuss their sleep issues with their doctor, Tomfohr-Madsen says, and that may lead them to seek remedies through alternative medicine or over-the-counter medication that could be harmful to their unborn child.   Tomfohr-Madsen advises doctors to not dismiss their patient's concerns and focus on finding solutions, of which she says there are many.  ""People often know that their sleep is a problem,"" she said. ""We want to validate that this isn't something normal, and it's a problem, and that it's something that we can work on.""",health
228,Facebook advertisers can write their own headlines for shared news stories,"Advertisers on Facebook are able to completely rewrite the displayed headline for news stories, CBC News has learned, opening the door for potential disinformation to spread on the platform while using news media branding as cover.   When placing an ad on the platform, one option is to include a link to a website, including links to news stories. The news story's real headline is auto-filled into the ad copy, but advertisers have the option to rewrite the headline. However, the article's website address still appears in the ad, giving the impression that the headline is the one written by the article's author.  This policy raises the possibility that it could be abused by political parties or third-party advertisers during the federal election campaign.  ""This is essentially, it would be a situation where Facebook is hosting and allowing and accepting monies for a misleading, essentially, political ad or a political weapon, at that point,"" said Jennifer Grygiel, an associate professor of communications at Syracuse University.  ""Any time that you can present a story as being different than it is, there's an opportunity for it to be abused,"" said Aleksander Essex, a professor of computer science at Western University in London, Ont. ""What you see and what's displayed to you online can potentially be changed in a number of ways. In this case, it sounds like Facebook is explicitly allowing it out of carelessness.""  Facebook is aware of the issue and said it is planning changes.  ""We have a system that gives publishers control over how their links appear on Facebook. We're working to put additional safeguards in place by the end of this year to make sure advertisers don't misuse this tool,"" said a Facebook spokesperson in an email to CBC News.    Before 2017, Facebook users and page administrators could change headlines of the articles they shared on the platform, allowing them to dramatically alter the way the articles were presented.   This function was abused by people looking to sow confusion and misinformation. One CBC article with a fake headline that included vulgar language circulated widely in 2015. Because the link included a CBC URL, many users believed the headline was real. A social media editor wrote a piece to clarify the headline was false.   Facebook removed the ability to alter headlines in June of 2017 as part of its efforts to limit the spread of disinformation. But there is one exception to this rule: pages which purchase ads can still modify an article's headline, as long as it's part of an advertising campaign.   In fact, this very tactic was recently used in the UK. That country's Conservative Party ran an ad in the first week of September containing a BBC article whose headline was, ""£14 billion pound cash boost for schools"".     There was one problem: the article's title had been modified by the party.  The actual BBC story is headlined ""School spending: Multi-billion pound cash boost announced,"" and instead put the number at £7.1 billion, criticizing the government's use of £14 billion pound figure as not the usual way of calculating spending.  ""Describing this as a £14bn increase would make the government seem more generous than it is in fact being"", wrote BBC head of statistics Robert Cuffe in the article.  In all, the UK's Conservative Party ran five different versions of this misleading ad, reaching a potential audience of 222,000 to 510,000 Britons. The ad is no longer active, and when searching for it in the Facebook Ad Library, users get a message that the ad did not conform to Facebook advertising standards and has been taken down. It's still possible to view the original ad.  Since then, the Conservative Party told the BBC: ""It was not our intention to misrepresent by using this headline copy with the news link, where the BBC's £7bn figure is clearly displayed, but we are reviewing how our advert headlines match accompanying links.""    According to Grygiel, this shows a failure of Facebook's ad service.   ""They should be building product in a way that is not democracy damaging,"" they said.  Grygiel said it is Facebook's responsibility to create advertising infrastructure that wouldn't allow advertisers to change headlines on articles. They pointed out that Facebook has a higher standard of what it will allow for advertising, because people can't opt out of it.  ""Because, again, these are people who are being targeted and this content is being forced on a viewer, as an ad, and so it has a higher threshold of accountability. So, they need to do better,"" they said.    A 2016 study by a team of researchers at Columbia University found that 59 per cent of links shared to Twitter had never been clicked, suggesting that a considerable number of users share articles without reading them. Another survey conducted in 2014 by the American Press Institute suggested that only four out of 10 Americans sought to ""go for more in-depth news, beyond the headlines"" in a given day.",technology
229,Scientists set sail on yearlong expedition to Arctic centre,"Researchers from more than a dozen nations launched Friday the biggest and most complex expedition ever attempted in the central Arctic — a yearlong journey through the ice they hope will improve the scientific models that underpin our understanding of climate change.  The 140-million euro ($158 million Cdn) expedition will see scientists from 19 countries including Germany, the United States, Britain, France, Russia and China work together in one of the most inhospitable regions of the planet.  ""The Arctic is the epicentre of global climate change,"" said Markus Rex of Germany's Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Ocean Research, who is leading the expedition. ""At the same time the Arctic is the region of the planet where we understand the climate system least.""  Packed full of scientific equipment, the German icebreaker RV Polarstern set sail from the port of Tromso in northern Norway, accompanied by a Russian vessel to search for a suitably large floe on which to anchor and set up base.  As the days get shorter and the sea freezes around it, the Polarstern will slowly drift off on its own toward the North Pole while rotating teams of dozens of scientists spend two months each conducting research on the ice.      The Arctic is changing pretty dramatically right now and that's something we need to get into.  - Matthew Shupe, Univeristy of Colorado atmospheric scientist     Stefanie Arndt, a sea ice physicist who has been preparing for the expedition for nine years, said darkness will be the biggest challenge.  ""Everyone worries about the cold, but the psychological aspect of not seeing anything and knowing there are polar bears out there is something that shouldn't be underestimated,"" she told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.   Scientists involved in the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate, or MOSAiC for short, have undergone firearms training. The camp will be also be secured by a perimeter fence and fireworks to scare off prowling predators.    Arndt, who will join the mission in mid-February, said the unique advantage of MOSAiC compared with other expeditions is the fact that researchers will be able to observe processes in the Arctic across an entire seasonal cycle.  ""What's particularly interesting is the transition from winter to spring,"" she said, a time when the ice is normally too thick for ships to reach the central Arctic.     Recording changes in the density, size and type of snow will help scientists better understand the flows of energy in the Arctic.  ""For example, how much light the snow reflects back into the atmosphere, how much it absorbs and how much light reaches the upper ocean,"" said Arndt. ""This has big implications for the ecosystem.""  Energy from light affects algae growth and ocean temperatures, which in turn influence how much sea ice melts from below.  Understanding these and other complex processes occurring in the Arctic is essential for the increasingly sophisticated computer models scientists use to predict weather and climate. Experts believe that any disruption to the Arctic's delicate cycle of freeze-and-thaw will be felt further south, though it's still not clear how.      We're doing it because we can, and nobody else can do it.  - Markus Rex, Expedition lead     ""The Arctic is changing pretty dramatically right now and that's something we need to get into,"" said Matthew Shupe, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Colorado who will take part in the expedition.  Recent changes in the jet stream — a current of air that circles and insulates the Arctic like a giant thermos — have allowed warm, moist winds from low latitudes to move north. At the same time, chilly blasts of Arctic air — the dreaded polar vortices — have brought deep freeze conditions to the continental U.S. and Europe.  ""A lot of this right now is a hot topic,"" said Shupe.     Concerns about global warming have spread far beyond the scientific community in recent years. The expedition started on the same day as global climate protests and ahead of a U.N. climate summit in New York next week.  Rex, the expedition head, said the co-operation between scientists from many different countries stands in contrast to the geostrategic jostling that big powers have started engaging in as the Arctic, with its untapped riches, begins to open up to exploration.  Germany finances half of expedition's cost  He put the fact that Germany, hitherto a second-league player in the Arctic, is leading the expedition down to the country's technical and logistical expertise.  ""We're doing it because we can, and nobody else can do it,"" said Rex.    Anja Karliczek, the German minister for science, said that as a major industrial nation, Germany needs to shoulder part of the responsibility for tackling climate change, and financing half of the expedition's costs was in the country's interests.  Unlike Russia, China and Sweden, which will also be sending icebreakers to supply the expedition, the United States won't be contributing a vessel.  ""A U.S.-flagged ship would have been a nice addition to MOSAiC,"" said Shupe.  ""On the other hand I think that the U.S. is making extraordinary contributions,"" he said, citing scientific and financial support from American institutions such as the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and NASA.",technology

231,"Greta Thunberg has talked about a 'carbon budget.' What is it, and why does it matter?","Hello, people! This is our weekly newsletter on all things environmental, where we highlight trends and solutions that are moving us to a more sustainable world. (Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Thursday.)  This week:     What do we mean by a 'carbon budget'?   Crowdfunding to preserve B.C. coastal wilderness   What you can do to save the birds      The carbon budget: What it is, why it matters    ""If we are to have a 67 per cent chance of limiting the global temperature rise to below 1.5 degrees [C], we had, on Jan. 1, 2018, 420 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide left in our CO2 budget. And of course, that number is much lower today. We emit about 42 gigatonnes of CO2 a year. At current emission levels, that remaining budget is gone within 8 1u002F2 years.""  Those words were delivered by youth climate activist Greta Thunberg to the French parliament on July 23, 2019. She said she has not heard much on the subject of a ""carbon budget,"" either from politicians or the media. But what's left in our carbon budget is of utmost importance if we hope to limit global warming.   Simply put, this budget refers to how much carbon — which includes CO2 and other greenhouse gases like methane — we can emit into the atmosphere before we pass the point of warming the Earth to 1.5 C or 2 C.  The carbon budget was discussed in the first of three special reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), released in October 2018. The final instalment, the Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC), will be discussed in Morocco this weekend, with a summary due to be released next Wednesday.  The Paris Agreement seeks to limit a global temperature rise to 2 C above pre-industrial levels this century (with a goal of keeping it to 1.5 C). The key to understanding the carbon budget is that even if countries keep in line with the Paris accord, if the budget is depleted by then, it won't matter. The damage will already be done. And it will be irreversible.  ""If you think about annual emissions and reducing emissions without thinking about the carbon budget, you could really blow past the Paris Agreement,"" said Brenda Ekwurzel, director of climate science at the U.S.-based Union of Concerned Scientists. ""That's the trouble.""  After a few years of stable global CO2 emissions, they rose in 2018, and there are concerns they may rise again in 2019.  If we don't pay attention to the carbon budget, it increases the chance of a host of global problems: the loss of coral reefs, no summer sea ice in the Arctic, more severe weather events and changes in crops that could lead to further food scarcity.  If it sounds dire, Ekwurzel said we have the power to change the trajectory.   ""Whenever we've been faced with a problem before and really … lean into it, we make big changes,"" Ekwurzel said. ""And a lot of those changes we're calling for, we can do.""  She said we need to look at deep de-carbonization of our energy supply, as well as doing ""nature-based enhancements,"" including the expansion and protection of carbon sinks such as forests, wetlands and mangroves, as well as seagrass. Ekwurzel stresses that economists say the transitions are economically feasible.   Like Greta, Ekwurzel said it's time that everyone — governments, organizations, businesses, and yes, consumers — begin to pay more attention to that budget that is nipping at our heels. She insists that together, we can make a difference.  ""Yeah,"" Ekwurzel said. ""We can do this.""  — Nicole Mortillaro    Reader feedback  The period between Sept. 20 and 27 is shaping up to be quite significant for climate action, with a major summit at the United Nations and major climate strikes planned for the next couple of Fridays.

The Big Picture: Crowdfunding land preservation  Late last month, a group of concerned citizens raised enough money to buy 800 hectares of wilderness on B.C.'s Sunshine Coast. The crowdfunding campaign operated by the B.C. Parks Foundation, an independent charity that works with B.C. Parks, raised $3 million to buy the expanse of land in Princess Louisa Inlet from a private seller. The aim of this purchase? Preservation. Andrew Day, CEO of B.C. Parks Foundation, said the organization wants to save the land from logging and other development. Said Day, ""We'll do our best to make sure that that area stays protected forever.""    Hot and bothered: Provocative ideas from around the web      In a sign that he is raising the stakes on climate action, United Nations secretary general Antonio Guterres has barred leading economies such as Japan and Australia from speaking at the UN's upcoming climate change summit because they're building new coal power plants.     Climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe, who is employed by Texas Tech University, is one of the most lucid and important voices in the global discussion about climate action. She's also Canadian, and this week she was named a United Nations Champion of the Earth, the UN's highest environmental honour.    Sun-rich Egypt has built one of the world's biggest solar installations, and it is about to go live. The 1.8-gigawatt array contains more than seven million panels and will be visible from space.      What you can do to save the birds    A new study, led by Ken Rosenberg at the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, has found there are three billion fewer birds in North America than there were in 1970. The Canadian and U.S. researchers behind the study say that habitat loss is likely the main cause, and conservation can make a difference, as shown by the increased populations of waterfowl and birds of prey.  But besides lobbying the government and donating money to conservation groups, there are also individual actions people can take to help protect birds.  Here are seven things the researchers, and the bird conservation and research groups that support them, suggest through their website 3billionbirds.org.  Reduce the chance that birds will hit windows. Use film, paint or string to break up reflections to prevent daytime collisions. And turn lights out at night.  Keep cats indoors. Cats are the second-highest human-related cause of bird declines after habitat loss, the researchers say. Keep cats indoors, or in an enclosed ""catio"" or on a leash when outdoors.  Replace your lawn with native plants. Native plants can provide shelter, nesting areas and food for birds — such as nectar, seeds and berries — that grass doesn't. You can find more info on ""greener"" lawn alternatives here.  Avoid pesticides. Pesticides can harm seed-eating birds that accidentally eat treated seeds, as well as indirectly damage insect-eating birds by killing their food source.  Buy shade-grown coffee. To grow coffee in the sun, farmers often clear forests that migratory birds need for food and shelter. Shade-grown coffee preserves that forest. The Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center has even created a certification for ""bird-friendly coffee"" that includes organic and fair trade standards.  Cut back on plastics. Studies show that at least 80 seabird species mistake plastic for food, the researchers say.   Watch birds and help track them. Anyone can participate in citizen science projects like Project FeederWatch, the Christmas Bird Count or the Breeding Bird Survey, which was key to generating the data in the study. Apps like eBird can make it easy to submit your everyday sightings. You can learn more about nature apps here.

232,Conservatives promise to spend $1.5B to buy new medical imaging equipment,"Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer promised Friday to spend $1.5 billion to buy new medical imaging equipment for facilities across Canada should his party win next month's federal election.  Scheer said a Conservative government would buy MRI and CT machines to replace aging ones, and that the move would reduce wait times.  He cited a Conference Board of Canada report that found there are excessive wait times for those screening tests,  costing the economy billions of dollars.  Scheer said that with Canada's aging population, the demand for such exams will only increase.    The Conservatives say the investment would give provinces more spending flexibility, with the federal government footing the bill for replacing out-of-date medical imaging equipment.  Scheer also highlighted his promise to maintain and increase the Canada Health Transfer, which provides long-term health-care funding to the provinces and territories.",health
233,How DNA could be key to stopping the dangerous decline of Canada's bee colonies,"As honey bee colonies across Canada continue to die off at alarming rates, scientists at York University believe that solutions to the problem could be hiding in the insects' DNA.  In October, the university is launching a breakthrough project to help beekeepers diagnose their ailing colonies.   The goal is to fight back against a potential population decline that could devastate both the environment and Canada's agriculture industries.  ""We have a bee health crisis and we don't really know how to improve it,"" said Amro Zayed, an associate professor at York University and co-lead on the project.  Researchers estimate that Canada's honey bees pollinate around $5.5 billion worth of crops every year, ranging from fruits and vegetables to canola seeds. They also produce 90 million pounds of honey annually.    But today, around 25 per cent of all honey bee colonies die each winter, around twice the rate that experts consider sustainable.  What's more, the worsening colony deaths often mystify beekeepers, who can only explain symptoms of the decline, and not the root causes behind the deaths.  ""When colonies die, often we're kind of guessing at why they died,"" Zayed told CBC Toronto.  DNA could unlock critical 'biomarkers'  Zayed and his team, which also includes experts at the University of British Columbia, say explanations for colony deaths could be found by examining the DNA of specific bee populations.  Examining that data could yield what genomics experts call ""biomarkers,"" signs of stress encoded in the honey bee genome that are effectively switched on or off by environmental factors.    To test for those indicators, the new project will create a system that allows beekeepers to send live worker bees to diagnostics centres, which will analyze the bees for clues embedded in their DNA.  The $10 million project begins in October and is expected to be complete by 2023. A coalition of genomics and conservation organizations are funding the project.  Scientists say offering a diagnostic service to beekeepers across the country is key to the project's success, since there are a wide range of factors believed to be killing off Canada's bees.  ""The stressors that are killing a honey bee colony near corn in Ontario are going to be different from the stressors affecting a colony that's pollinating blueberries in B.C.,"" Zayed explained.    The current diagnosis system involves post-mortem analysis if dead colonies, which experts call expensive, slow and incomplete.  By diagnosing a living colony's health problems, the project creators say beekeepers will soon be able to proactively take action before their colonies die off.  ""Ideally that will prevent the large colony mortality that Canadian beekeepers experience,"" Zayed said.  Although one in four colonies die every year, Zayed said the overall number of bees is not yet in decline, since beekeepers can create new colonies by splitting the surviving ones and importing new queen bees to maintain the hive.    Wild bees also at risk  While honey bee health is in decline, wild bee populations may be facing an even more uncertain future, in part because those species are not tightly managed like their crop-pollinating cousins.  ""They're much more threatened than honey bees are,"" said Annemarie Baynton, a program manager at the city of Toronto's environment and energy office. ""Once they're lost they can't be replaced.""  Toronto is home to some 360 species of wild bees, which are increasingly threatened by habitat loss.  ""As cities, we're constantly developing, we're paving over green space, we're building over green space, so we're losing the natural habitat,"" Bayonton said.  To combat those losses, the city launched a new program this year called PollinateTO, which is set to build 37 new pollinator gardens at a cost of up to $5,000 per project.  The gardens are scheduled to be planted in the spring, and the city is aiming to build 100 new bee-friendly spaces after the next round of grants are handed out.",technology
234,Fighting climate change is not like fighting a war. It's harder,"In a personal message attached to the Green Party's election platform, Elizabeth May invokes the Second World War, Winston Churchill and the evacuation of Dunkirk to frame the challenge of combating climate change and the need for both courageous leadership and collective action.  Unfortunately, May's grasp of the historical details is a little shaky. But this isn't the first time she has used the Second World War as a metaphor. Twelve years ago, she caused a minor stir when she compared Stephen Harper's climate policies to Neville Chamberlain's appeasement of Hitler. She's also not the only public figure who has used the war effort to explain what is required now.  There is something to be said for using history to frame the issue. These are, without a doubt, consequential days. But tidy stories about Churchill's fortitude might only understate the scale and complexity of the current challenge.  Climate change is not much like modern war.  If, for example, climate change was a rogue state or an international terrorist organization that posed a grave and immediate threat to Western peace and stability, some coalition of nations likely would have agreed already to bomb it into submission. If global warming could be solved with fighter jets, somebody would have tried by now.    If climate change could be tackled as a military threat, the debate in this country would be flipped on its head. The Conservatives would be most eager to take aggressive action and there would be no grumbling about how Canada's contribution to the problem was much smaller than that of China or the United States. Joe Oliver, the former Conservative finance minister, would not be arguing that, all things considered, climate change might work out okay for Canada.  If recent history is any example, the Liberals, New Democrats and Greens would be less enthusiastic about dropping bombs. But there might still be a general agreement that Canada should make a serious contribution somehow. Public commentators would not look kindly on anyone who suggested it should be up to other countries to deal with the problem.  But climate change is not as simple as war.  For one thing, recent military interventions haven't asked anything of the average citizen. Only those members of the military charged with carrying out the mission, and their families, have faced any kind of sacrifice.  In that respect, climate change might appear to have more in common with the two world wars of the 20th century, when the home front was more directly engaged in the fight. The federal income tax, for instance, was introduced in 1917 as a means to fund the Canadian war effort. Food rationing was mandated during both world wars.    Perhaps Canadians were more deferential to authority and less cynical in those days. But the heaviest request for sacrifice — conscription for overseas military service — still put an enormous strain on national unity. The Borden government's introduction of conscription in 1917 angered farmers in the West, led to riots in Quebec and precipitated ""the worst election campaign in Canadian history.""  Mackenzie King's government subsequently tried to fight the Second World War with a voluntary force for three years before asking Canadians to approve conscription in a national plebiscite in 1942. The result once again split the country along linguistic lines: eight provinces were overwhelmingly in favour, Quebec was overwhelmingly opposed.  King — who famously said, ""conscription if necessary, but not necessarily conscription""  — stalled for another two years before following through, effectively limiting the number of conscripted men who were sent into battle before the war's end in 1945. War, in that case, required compromise.  Cinematic moments of leadership make for fun movies, but the task of holding a country together and leading it through moments of great consequence is always more complicated than we're sometimes led to believe.  The enemy is ... us?  For all their complications, real military campaigns still, at least, benefit from the presence of tangible and foreign enemies. Climate change, on the other hand, is about the society we have constructed. It's one thing to rally your fellow citizens to fight Adolf Hitler and the Nazis (particularly when, as in Churchill's case, your own country's liberty is at stake). It's something else entirely to deal with the way we ourselves live, what we do and how we do it.  Putting a price on carbon is not nearly a political event on the same level as conscription (which, by the way, did not come with the offer of a full refund). But like conscription, climate policy already has produced significant regional splits in public opinion, with opposition most heavily concentrated in Alberta and Saskatchewan, two provinces that rely on oil and gas development.  In their party platform, the Greens propose completely phasing out the production of bitumen within 15 years and transitioning energy workers to new jobs. To do that without tearing the country apart would be a remarkable achievement (the Greens are currently polling at 5 per cent in Alberta).    If climate change is like war, it can't be simply reduced to a bidding contest over who would set the most ambitious targets. It requires leadership. But it also requires bringing a country and its citizens along. The details of policy — like the details of history — matter.  To underline the threat, challenge the complacent and motivate the hopeful, war is a tempting metaphor. The sacrifices and efforts of previous generations can reinforce a sense of responsibility toward the present and the future. Historic leadership can provide enduring inspiration.  But if fighting climate change has anything in common with World War II, it's the fact that it will be hard — and more complex than we might choose to imagine. Winning a war is seldom easy.",technology

236,Why Scheer campaigns with Kenney but not Ford,"Alberta Premier Jason Kenney fired up the crowd in front of a candidate's campaign office in Edmonton on Saturday as Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer hopped on stage.   It's a scene you likely won't see repeated during the federal election campaign in Ontario, which is led by Conservative Premier Doug Ford.  Conservatives now make up most of provincial governments across Canada. So why does Scheer embrace one premier, but seemingly avoid another?  Ontario is shaping up to be a main battleground on election night.   The path to a majority government for either the Conservatives or the Liberals runs through the province. It's also ""seat-rich"" as political insiders like to say, a nod to the fact that more than a third of Parliament's 338 seats call Ontario home.  The difference between Alberta and Ontario   A negative perception in Ontario puts far more seats in jeopardy than anywhere else in the country.   Ontarians have lived with a Ford government for over a year, meaning there's been enough time to form opinions about his leadership (whether positive or negative).   Ford is one of Canada's least popular premiers. Only 38 per cent of people approve of him, according to an Angus Reid poll.  Those opinions aren't helpful for Scheer. A similar survey from the firm found that 42 per cent of Ontarians say they have decided not to vote Conservative because of Ford.     For his part, the premier says he's been too busy to make an appearance at any of the handful of events Scheer has had in the Toronto region — including one just a few blocks from Ford's home.   ""Honestly, I just haven't had time. I don't want to interfere in the federal election. I want them to go out there and have a good race and let the best party win,"" Ford said.  When asked about it, Scheer didn't answer directly. He talked about the diverse geography of their volunteers and supporters.   ""I look forward to the results on Oct. 21, when the people in Ontario do federally what they did in Ontario.""    Tim Powers, a Conservative strategist with Summa Strategies, says whether or not to share a stage with provincial leaders comes down to opportunity versus cost.   ""Sometimes you're toxic and sometimes you're the Glade air freshener,"" he said, when asked about the difference between showing up with Ford, versus a premier like Blaine Higgs in New Brunswick.   Ford's presence wouldn't ""produce a favourable outcome"" for Scheer's campaign, he said.      Sweeping all Ontario's seats won't happen for the Conservatives, but they have a chance to accomplish that feat in Alberta. The party won 33 out of 38 seats in the province, while the Liberals and NDP split the remaining five.  Alberta is staunchly blue. So unlike in Ontario, it's very unlikely Scheer will lose votes in Alberta for campaigning with another Conservative leader.   In fact, it could benefit Scheer to be seen with a popular figure in the province. Kenney's approval rating after his first quarter in office was 61 per cent.  Fodder for the opposition   Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau hasn't been shy about attacking the Ontario premier either — going so far as to call him out by name a dozen times in a single media availability.   It started summer 2018 when the two sparred on immigration in a face-to-face meeting. Since then, the Liberals have turned from sunny ways to taking every opportunity they can to slam Ford.   Ford has been criticized for sweeping cuts to education, environmental initiatives and social programs.   But the Liberal strategy goes one step further. They're tying Ford to Scheer.   If the two leaders were to get on a stage together, Powers says it would ""play into the hands of Justin Trudeau.""    When Trudeau made a health-care promise on the campaign trail, he asked the crowd about provincial and federal relations.   ""Who do you want at the negotiation table standing up to Doug Ford? Andrew Scheer, who follows Doug Ford's lead or our Liberal team who will fight for you?""  Scheer has fought back against the opposition barrage, but shaking the association is hard when you're painted in the same political colour.  'He's a great friend of mine'  The rationale to appear together goes beyond politics in Alberta's case. Kenney and Scheer also have a close personal relationship.   ""He's a great friend of mine,"" Kenney said Saturday after the event.   ""I'm just returning the favour.""   Their campaigning together started months ago, during the provincial election in April.   In a Calgary baseball diamond, the two leaders outlined the job ahead — ending then-premier Rachel Notley's government, then turning the crosshairs to Trudeau in Ottawa.   Scheer told supporters, shrouded in blankets of mid-blizzard snow, that if they got Kenney to the Alberta legislature he'd make it to the Prime Minister's Office.   There are still 23 days left until the verdict on whether he's able to keep that promise. ",politics
237,Liberals will promise a student-loan repayment break for new parents: report,"Measures to make post-secondary education more affordable will take centre stage Sunday when Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau unveils his party's platform, The Canadian Press has learned.  Among the measures to be announced is one that would allow new parents to take an interest-free break from paying off student loans until their youngest child turns five.  The payment pause would also apply to those who have already graduated but have not yet paid off their student debts, according to sources who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the platform.  Trudeau is to unveil the platform Sunday at the University of Toronto's Mississauga campus, where he'll also take questions from students.  The venue is intended to highlight the contrast between the federal Liberals' commitment to public education and the cuts to education programs implemented by Ontario Premier Doug Ford's Progressive Conservative government.  Trudeau has been portraying federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer as a clone of Ford, especially in the battleground province that accounts for 121 of the 338 seats up for grabs on Oct. 21.    The Ford government has faced protests over plans to reverse more generous student assistance provided by the previous Liberal government, including eliminating free university and college tuition for low-income students and cutting back on grants offered through the Ontario Student Assistance Program.  It has argued that the changes are needed because the cost of the OSAP program has become unsustainable and must be refocused on students most in need as the province struggles to trim its $7.4-billion deficit.  Ontario's auditor general last year reported that OSAP costs had jumped 25 per cent and could grow to $2 billion annually by 2020-21.  Ford is also under fire for increasing class sizes in public schools — a measure the province's equivalent of the parliamentary budget officer said last week said will mean almost 10,000 fewer teachers over the next five years. Federal Liberals pounced on that report Saturday in a news release from Ontario Liberal MP and campaign co-chair Navdeep Bains.  ""Our future prosperity depends on quality education and care for all of our children,"" said Bains, emphasizing that Scheer ""said Doug Ford was the best choice for premier of Ontario.""    According to a 2018 Canadian University Survey Consortium report, 50 per cent of post-secondary students graduated with debt. The average debt was pegged at $27,929.  The Conservatives have promised to increase matching grants for registered education savings plans.  They've also promised tax cuts for the lowest income bracket and tax credits for maternity benefits. Neither of those is specifically about post-secondary education but each would affect many of the same people as the expected Liberal promise.    The New Democrats have promised to eliminate interest on federal student loans, increase grants for post-secondary studies, and work with the provinces to eliminate tuition on higher education eventually.  The Greens have pledged to eliminate post-secondary tuition outright and to forgive all student-loan debt held by the federal government.  The Liberals' promised break on student loan payments is meant to reinforce previously announced measures aimed at making life more affordable for young families.  Trudeau has promised to boost the Canada Child Benefit by 15 per cent for children under the age of one and he's one-upped the Conservatives by pledging to make maternity and parental benefits tax-free when they're paid and to raise the basic personal income tax deduction to $15,000 from $12,069 for people making less than $147,000.",politics
238,Worried about climate change? You've got a tough decision to make,"On climate change, the choice facing Canadian voters in this federal election is stark — and not perfectly simple.  Elections can be complicated that way. And if solving climate change was easy, we'd have done it by now.  Climate policy has been at the forefront of a federal election just once before — in 2008, when Stéphane Dion proposed a national carbon tax and Stephen Harper's Conservatives responded by claiming that such a policy would bring about economic ruin.  That campaign ultimately was overtaken by an economic crash and the arrival of the Great Recession. But the partisan fight over Dion's proposal set a template for the debate about climate policy in Canada, one that's still at work in 2019.  If anything is different now, it's that teenagers are in the streets. And that the fires and floods and storms of recent years have made climate change something more than a theoretical threat. Skeptics on the political right also have been joined by newly aggressive voices on the left — Green and NDP leaders who are saying we must go further and faster.  The greatest policy gap, measured in terms of declared and demonstrated ambition, lies between the Conservatives and the other three major parties — a difference that was underlined on Friday by Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer's decision to pass on taking part in one of Friday's massive climate rallies.  The Conservative pause  The Conservatives aren't proposing to do nothing, of course, but they would do less than what the Liberals have done or are proposing to do. Scheer has said that his government's first act would be to repeal the federal carbon price. He would scrap the clean fuel standard. The existing ""output-based pricing system"" for heavy emitters would be replaced with a requirement that firms invest an unspecified amount in green technology or research.    The Conservative plan expresses an interest in Canada's current international target — to reduce emissions by 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030 — but it's not clear how a Conservative government would get anywhere near it. Independent analyses have found that the Conservatives would miss the target for 2030 by either 109 megatonnes or 179 megatonnes.  In that latter scenario, modelled by Mark Jaccard of Simon Fraser University, total national emissions would actually rise — from 700 megatonnes in 2020 to 710 megatonnes in 2030.  Scheer's approach amounts to a pause — scaling back on Canadian action while waiting to see what larger countries do. Indeed, part of the Conservative plan is premised on the possibility that other countries, like China, will turn to Canada for help (and allow Canada to take credit for the emission reductions that result).  On Friday, Scheer suggested that widening a car tunnel in British Columbia would lead to reduced emissions — a dubious proposition that clashes with what we know about the behaviour of motorists.  The Liberals' 'not perfect' plan  Eleven years after Dion, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau is still defending his choice of climate actions. But in one of the Liberal Party's newest campaign ads, Trudeau looks into the camera and acknowledges the counter-argument — that he needs to do more. ""Of course, it's not perfect,"" he says of the Liberal plan, ""and we need to do more.""    Canada's current emissions target was established by the Harper government. Trudeau declined to set a more ambitious objective — a decision for which he is still criticized by New Democrats and Greens, and activists who argue Canada should be doing more.  When the Conservatives left office in 2015, Canada was on track to miss the 2030 target by 300 megatonnes. Three years later, a federal analysis of recent federal and provincial policies determined that the gap had been reduced to 79 megatonnes.  The Liberals point to those gains as an indication of substantial progress. Critics point to the remaining 79 megatonnes as proof of failure.  Since the spring budget, and through the first weeks of the campaign, the Liberals have been attempting to compensate for the gap: new incentives to encourage the purchase of zero-emission vehicles, a tax cut for firms that develop clean technology, interest-free loans to cover the cost of retrofitting homes.  That lingering gap  On Friday, before taking part in that massive climate march in Montreal, Trudeau announced that a re-elected Liberal government would plant two billion trees over the next ten years — part of a larger plan to use natural carbon sinks to reduce emissions by 30 megatonnes.  Still, there's no complete accounting for all of that 79 megatonne gap.  That's not the only aspect of his government's climate agenda that Trudeau has been called upon to explain, of course. As he marched at the climate rally in Montreal on Friday, a group of demonstrators near him rhythmically chanted, ""What about ... the pipeline?""    Trudeau (and others) argue that it's possible to both build the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion and take action on climate change, to proceed with the project and still hit Canada's international target. But he's up against a reflexive impression among many voters that a new pipeline does not belong in a future that will require great amounts of clean energy.  ""Trees won't hide the pipeline you bought,"" NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh tweeted at Trudeau on Friday. (Singh himself has struggled to explain his position on another resource development, but that's another matter.)  The bigger questions  Viewed from one perspective, Canada has some of the most stringent climate policies in the G20. And underlying the debate about Trans Mountain are significant questions about the national economy and national unity, most of which have been side-stepped by pipeline opponents over the last four years.  Viewed from another perspective, the prime minister is still a hypocrite.  Still, the New Democrats and Greens aren't just opposed to the Trans Mountain expansion. They're also promising to do more to reduce emissions. The NDP would like to cut emissions by 38 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. The Greens would set a target of 60 per cent.    Neither party has yet produced projections that show exactly how they would get to those levels.  In the meantime, both parties are promoting ambitious policy goals. The NDP says it would retrofit half of all homes by 2030. The Greens say they would ensure that every building in Canada — ""residential, commercial and institutional"" — would be carbon neutral by 2030.  The New Democrats want to achieve net-zero electricity generation nationally by 2030. The Greens want to remove all fossil fuel generation from the electricity grid.  A lot of 'what' and not enough 'how'  Those would be major changes. But Andrew Leach, an economist at the University of Alberta who advised Rachel Notley's provincial government on its climate policies, has criticized both plans for lacking detail on implementation.  The Liberals can be chided for not yet showing exactly how they'd hit the current target — a target they now say they'd exceed. But the New Democrats and Greens can still be challenged to explain how they'd achieve more.  The NDP's most ambitious proposal may be its pitch to use ""the powers of the federal government to ensure that the provinces set and meet"" emissions reduction targets. That approach that would require significant and inevitably difficult negotiations with a set of premiers who already have demonstrated a lack of enthusiasm about federal intervention.  In some cases, the policy differences between these three parties might be overstated. Neither the New Democrats nor the Greens are calling for an immediate increase above the current schedule for the federal carbon price — the Greens would raise it after 2022, but that will be an issue for the next federal election.  The NDP has criticized the Liberal approach to heavy emitters but would only adjust the current system: reducing the subsidy threshold from 80 or 90 per cent of average emissions to 70 per cent.    Trudeau also has diminished the long-term differences between the parties with a campaign commitment to aim for net-zero emissions by 2050, effectively matching the the Green and NDP targets. But that also leaves something to the imagination.  At least, it does if you're actually interested in getting Canada to net-zero by the middle of this century.  If you're basically unconvinced that significant action is necessary, the choice is fairly simple. If you'd simply rather not pay the cost of the federal carbon price, the Conservatives are offering themselves as an option.  If you're more interested in seeing Canada reduce its emissions, you have your choice of three major parties, offering varying levels of ambition and explanations.  One of those parties supports building a pipeline. It's also a party that currently is at or near the top of most opinion polls  Voters worried about climate change might wish that the current government would go faster. But they're also faced with the possibility that choosing a more aspirational alternative might split the vote and allow the Conservatives to win power.  All elections are complicated. The first federal election that's really about climate change just comes with higher stakes.  ",politics
239,"Conservative government would create national energy corridor, Scheer says","Andrew Scheer says a Conservative government would build a single coast-to-coast energy corridor to transport Canada's natural resources if elected.   The project would be used to move things like oil, gas, hydroelectricity and telecommunications.  ""Our natural resources can be a source for good,"" Scheer said, at an announcement Saturday in Edmonton in front of a backdrop of oil and gas workers.   The party says the corridor would minimize environmental impacts, increase certainty for investors and create jobs. Scheer did not specify on Saturday what projects or infrastructure could be part of this corridor.    The Conservatives say they would appoint a task force of experts to provide recommendations on how to build the corridor. It would be expected to deliver recommendations within six months.   The panel would consider Indigenous consultations, the role of provincial laws, uses for the corridor, cost, benefits for regions and industries and a potential route.   After the party receives the suggestions, Scheer said they would start work with the provinces and Indigenous people to move forward on the project.    The path such a corridor would have to take through Quebec to reach the Atlantic Ocean could be a trigger point, as Premier François Legault has been clear that his province doesn't want another pipeline.   Scheer acknowledged there will be criticism of this proposal, but said he believes it can be completed.  The party's news release said the Parliamentary Budget Officer has estimated the cost of this promise, but as of Saturday afternoon that report had not been published.  The Conservative leader drew on examples of Louis St. Laurent's vision for the Trans-Canada Highway and John Diefenbaker's permanent road to the Arctic Circle. Scheer had previously compared the creation of such a pathway to building the railway in the days of Confederation.  Conservative premiers supportive  Scheer first outlined his vision for an energy corridor in May.  ""I want to talk about a national corridor that would move Canadian oil, gas, electricity, telecommunications and potentially anything else that runs along the ground,"" he had said.   At the time, he didn't specify the geography, cost or timeline. Scheer said he believed it was something the different provinces could agree on.    New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs​​​​, Alberta Premier Jason Kenney and Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe — all Conservative — support Scheer's proposal. The topic was also brought up in July during the premiers' Council of the Federation meeting.  At the announcement in Edmonton on Saturday, Scheer criticized the Liberals and Justin Trudeau for scaring away investments in Canada's energy sector. The federal government bought the Trans Mountain pipeline last year for $4.5 billion after the proponent, Kinder Morgan, expressed dissatisfaction in the delays and uncertainty. There are still no shovels in the ground as the project has faced numerous court challenges. ",politics
240,The Green Party Express: campaigning by train with Elizabeth May,"Green Party Leader Elizabeth May arrived at the Halifax train station on Wednesday, just minutes before the scheduled departure time, with her luggage, a boarding pass and three staffers in tow.  Compared to other party leaders who criss-cross the country in chartered planes and buses, trailed by entourages of staffers and journalists, May travels light.  Passengers' heads turned as she arrived. One person groused about May cutting into the boarding line to join staffers who were saving a space for her. Another said it was nice to see a politician taking a train.  For the next 22 hours — from Halifax through Truro and Amherst in Nova Scotia, and Moncton and Miramichi in New Brunswick — May turned a Via Rail passenger train into an unofficial Green Party Express, hopping on and off along the way for political rallies.  ""We have a busy schedule on board,"" she said as she headed for the platform.  May's choice of such a low-impact mode of travel is one part principle, one part calculation: in an election that's seen the threat of climate change vault to top-of-mind for a great many voters, travelling by rail is suddenly a good look.  Her rail tour ended in Montreal, where she attended Friday's climate change rally alongside celebrated teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg and as many as 500,000 concerned Canadians.    Polls ahead of the fall federal election campaign suggested the Greens were in a position to make a breakthrough this time, possibly by supplanting the NDP and snapping up the party's seats in B.C. and Quebec. But the Greens appear to have peaked in the polls; now they're struggling with high expectations and a newly competitive NDP and Bloc Québécois.  Many say May's freewheeling and unfiltered campaigning style is both a strength and a weakness. Her 1,346 kilometre whistlestop train tour demonstrated that.    When CBC News was invited along for the trip, a party staffer warned it would be a chaotic day and night of ""shotgun rallies"" on train platforms throughout the Maritimes, with May frequently jumping off and running to greet supporters, give speeches and snap selfies before sprinting back to catch the train before it left.  The crowds were enthusiastic but small — sometimes running to just 30 or 40 people cheering and waving — and the stops were short, usually about 15 minutes. ""We gotta get back on the train!"" she told one crowd. ""I don't want to make Via Rail mad at us.""  Turns out Via Rail wasn't wild about May using their trains to campaign. Via spokesperson Marie-Anna Murat said new Privy Council guidelines for Crown corporations say Via's trains and stations must not be used for partisan activities.  ""The guidelines state that Via Rail must avoid any perception that government resources are used for partisan purposes,"" Murat said in an email to CBC.    Asked about Via's policy, May shrugged it off, saying that the rail service's management had never complained about her use of Via transport in the past.  At least one political strategist says May's off-the-cuff campaigning style is hurting her party's chances.  ""May is is quite the character,"" said Erica Ifill, who writes columns and runs a branding agency. ""She really speaks her mind. Where Elizabeth may struggle is in the thing that makes her great. I find that she requires more structure sometimes than she allows herself to have.""  Where the Greens lack of structure hurts them is in message discipline, she said. Recently, May got into trouble when she told CBC that elected members of her party would not be prevented from reopening the debate on abortion, even though she believes personally in a women's right to choose.    NDP leader Jagmeet Singh quickly attacked May, questioning her commitment to women's reproductive rights.  ""He keeps making up lies about us. And that's very frustrating for me, honestly,"" May told CBC News while sitting in the dining car. ""I just thought more of Jagmeet. I didn't think he'd keep attacking me on things that aren't true.""  May said she doesn't think that incident has derailed her campaign. As the train rolled through Nova Scotia, she said the Green Party had seen its support growing throughout the Maritimes.  ""I mean, right now we're seeing a shift on the ground,"" she said. ""So I'm hearing from my candidates that they have more orders for lawn signs and they can't keep up.""    May said her party is on track for its best showing ever in a federal general election, citing the election of more Greens in provincial legislatures in B.C., Ontario and P.E.I. She said she's hoping Canadians elect a minority government, one which would give parties like hers the balance of power.  ""It would be massively bad news for this country if either the Liberals or the Conservatives had enough seats to claim a majority government with a minority of public support,"" May said. ""A minority Parliament forces us to work together.""  ",politics

242,Caught in the watchdog crossfire: Elderly B.C. woman died with DND claim in limbo,"Myrna Mason, an elderly British Columbia widow of a former soldier, tried to believe that Canada's military ombudsman would deliver her justice — but she died unexpectedly on the last day of December 2018 with her long-standing case still unresolved.  She had waged a four-year battle with the Department of National Defence (DND) for a survivor's pension, according to documents shared with CBC News by her family,  The inexplicable delay was a source of immense frustration for her during her final months.  ""It really left her bewildered and angry and disillusioned with the government,"" said her son David Spencer, an RCMP staff sergeant, who stated he was speaking solely as his mother's representative not as a federal police officer.  Her case was one of more than half a dozen individual files or initiatives caught in the crossfire of a behind-the-scenes bureaucratic controversy, which raged for more than a year between the DND and former ombudsman Gary Walbourne.  Starting in summer 2017, Walbourne and three members of his staff were hit with a wide-ranging internal review after complaints of mismanagement, nepotism and misuse of public funds were filed with DND's review services branch.  Review upheld complaints  Most of those complaints related to staffing were deemed ""founded"" — a result the former ombudsman now challenges, maintaining he and others were the subject of a vendetta.    A Federal Court judge recently said the complaint review was handled unfairly and ordered DND to take another look at it.  While the review was going on, the ombudsman's office was stripped of some of its financial and human resources authority, according to Federal Court records.  Walbourne also was unable to arrange a meeting with Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan or get his phone calls to the minister returned — the aftermath of a mysterious, private falling-out between Walbourne and Sajjan.  The dispute raged on for more than a year until Walbourne's early retirement.   During that time, the progress of existing cases and the prospective opening of new ones almost ground to a halt, the court documents suggest.  A spokesperson for the current ombudsman, Gregory Lick, said Thursday that, because of privacy considerations, he was unable to say how many complaints may have gone dark during that time.    ""Our office cannot comment on cases pertaining to individual complainants we investigated or sought resolution to during that time period,"" said Andrew Bernardo, the ombudsman's director of communications.  According to the documents provided by Mason's family, the exchange of letters between her, DND and the ombudsman virtually dried up between early 2017 and spring 2018 — precisely when the office became engulfed in turmoil.  An online database of letters exchanged between the ombudsman office and the minister shows several letters written by Walbourne to both the minister and the chief of the defence staff went unanswered in the spring and summer of 2018.  Wrote to apologize  During that time period, Walbourne wrote to Mason personally to effectively apologize for not being able to get results.  ""We have urged the minister to use his discretion to correct this unfairness, and to date we have not been successful in prompting a resolution of your case,"" Walbourne wrote on May 4, 2018, at the height of his dispute with the minister's office.  Mason, 77, was the widow of retired sergeant Thomas (Bill) Mason. She was denied a survivor's benefit after his 2014 death under a federal policy that prohibits a spouse from collecting a pension benefit if they marry a former military member who is 60 years old or older.  It is known within the federal bureaucracy as the ""gold diggers clause,"" and it was something the Liberal government promised to address during the 2015 federal election. In the last spring's federal budget, the Liberals promised a $150 million fund to address the issue.    It came too late for Mason. Spencer said that, in light of the Walbourne case, the long silence over his mother's claim now makes sense.  Disappointed by bureaucracy  ""I'm disappointed,"" said Spencer. ""I'm disappointed by the bureaucracy and in-fighting took away my mum's right to a survivor's benefit. We were not talking millions of dollars here.""  The foundation of Mason's complaint was that the Defence Department initially stated in writing that she was entitled to the survivor's benefit, but then reneged. Officials appear to have adjusted the criteria without notifying the family.  ""The ombudsman was very sympathetic and quite shocked that the case was being held up,"" said Spencer, who acted as his mother's sounding board.  ""The whole time we were just being patient and I just said, 'Mum, this is bureaucracy at its finest but we're gonna win this.' And she kept saying, 'I think they're waiting for me to die, and they won't have to pay me.'""  Mason died on Dec. 31, 2018, in Kelowna, B.C., after a short illness.  Ombudsman offered condolences  The man who replaced Walbourne as ombudsman, Lick, penned a handwritten note to the family expressing condolences and regret that she passed away without ""closure"" in her case.  ""My office remains committed to helping bring resolution to this issue, and we are continuing to directly engage with the minister's office in this light,"" said the Jan. 18 letter.  Spencer said he has not heard from the government since. He said the issue for him is not the money, but rather the indignity his mother faced.  A spokesperson for the Defence Department didn't answer specific questions posed by CBC News about Mason's plight.  Minister's office looking at case  ""We are aware of this case and are looking into it further,"" said DND spokesperson Dan Lebouthillier. ""Due to privacy considerations, we cannot disclose details of individual cases.""  Earlier this week, CBC News reported on the circumstances surrounding Walbourne's departure and the restrictions placed on his office.  Veterans advocate Barry Westholm said he had tried to convince the ombudsman to take up an investigation into the tragic death of Pte. Leah Green, who took her own life after leaving the military suffering chronic pain from a spinal cord injury.  He said he got nowhere at the time — and he now understands why.  ""At this meeting Mr. Walbourne stated while he agreed with this, that there was immense pressure on his office and that any new internal [to the Ombudsman's Office] investigations would be met with much resistance,"" said Westholm.

243,No regret: Captured ISIS fighter wants to come home — but not if he will be judged by Canadian law,"Before he was captured by Syrian Kurdish forces in February, Canadian Mohammed Khalifa went from being a cog in the ranks of ISIS to its English language voice.       Khalifa, 35, who goes by his ISIS nom de guerre Abu Ridwan, says he would like to return to Canada provided he can bring his non-Canadian wife and their three children.  ""This area is no doubt a dangerous area. I'd want to take my family out of there,"" Abu Ridwan told The Fifth Estate in an interview from a prison in northern Syria.  But if his return means he will likely face justice in a Canadian court, Abu Ridwan said he would rather remain locked up where he is.   ""In terms of going back to be judged, then no.""   While captured ISIS members and their families at home in Canada have been pleading with Ottawa for help to repatriate them home, the country's handling of the contentious issue has come in for criticism by security experts.  Watch Abu Ridwan talk about his belief in ISIS:    For Abu Ridwan, the desire to live in an Islamic state took him out of Canada six years ago. In the summer of 2013, Abu Ridwan had graduated from Toronto's Seneca College and had a job with a tech company when he decided to leave it all behind to be a part of the emerging Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.   ""I was happy coming to a place where we have an Islamic state and we could live in an Islamic state and implement the Sharia law. I was content with what I had and the life I was living.""   Within a few months, he had joined the ranks of ISIS and pledged his allegiance to its leader, Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi.   His Arabic and English language skills caught the attention of ISIS commanders and he was recruited to the group's media department headquartered in the city of Raqqa.  ""We come in the morning and we leave later in the day. If you finish your work, you might leave early. It's nothing unusual if you consider how you work even in like Canada; you know if you are sick or have an emergency, you take a day off. It was very normal,"" Abu Ridwan said.       Watch ""When terror comes home: The plan for deradicalizing returning ISIS fighters"" on The Fifth Estate on CBC-TV on Sunday at 9 p.m.    Yet life was anything but normal for the civilians who lived in Raqqa. The underground citizen journalist group — Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently — documented 29 public civilian executions in Raqqa in November and December 2014.   Abu Ridwan said his monthly ISIS salary of slightly less than $200 US was enough to live a comfortable life.   ""It's not like you're struggling and you're poor or anything. You are still living good, you were eating well.""   Flames of War   Abu Ridwan told The Fifth Estate that after spending months translating and reading ISIS news items, he was given a script for a propaganda video by ISIS commanders in September 2014.   ""They said we want you to read this and so I recorded it, and they took it and they asked for some changes. I rerecorded some parts, and that was it,"" Abu Ridwan said.  But when ISIS released that Flames of War video on social media platforms, the threats it contained against Western countries caused a panic among security agencies in Canada, the United States and Europe.    Terrorism researcher Amarnath Amarasingam has interviewed more than 50 foreign fighters and describes Flames of War as ISIS's stamp on how it wanted the world to perceive it.    ""The video was horrific. It showed a series of executions and set the stage of what we knew of ISIS going forward in terms of its brutality and its perverse creativity in how it chose to execute so-called spies and people that it considered to be enemies of the state,"" said Amarasingam, an assistant professor at Queen's University in Kingston, Ont.  At FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C., an alert was issued asking the public to call in any tips, however small, that would lead to unveiling the identity of the voice.   After the fall of Raqqa to Kurdish forces backed by the United States, Abu Ridwan and his family fled to the city of Baghouz. Earlier this year, ISIS fighters held up in the city surrendered to Syrian Kurdish militia. Abu Ridwan was one of them.   Masked executioner?  Abu Ridwan told The Fifth Estate that his role in the Flames of War was limited to narrating the video and that he did not participate in any executions.  But intelligence analyst Jeff Weyers believes Abu Ridwan might be the masked executioner in the video.     A masked man can be seen presiding over Syrian soldiers digging their own graves before being shot in the back of the head, their bodies tumbling into the freshly dug graves.   Weyers suspects that Abu Ridwan is diminishing his role to avoid prosecution for mass murder.     ""A lot of the Western fighters are trying to diminish their responsibility — I am a chef, I am a cook, I am a driver. Well, there are a lot of chefs, cooks and drivers right now and not a whole lot of fighters that helped the Islamic State take over all this territory,"" Weyers said.   Geolocating a crime scene  Weyers said Canadian authorities can take steps to determine whether Abu Ridwan was the executioner in the ISIS video.  ""Even wearing a mask, you are still revealing portions of your face. The eyes are enough that you can do an identification.""           What to do with suspected Canadian ISIS fighters and their families detained in Syria?    Another method is using ISIS's own video to pinpoint the exact spot where the massacre took place. It's a technique called ""geolocation.""   Weyers said he spent hours pouring over the Flames of War video identifying landmarks and managed to locate the precise spot where the massacre took place.   He said he gave the information to the RCMP but is not aware whether anything was done with it.   Captured ISIS recruits  Amarasingam said Abu Ridwan is one of six Canadian men being held in prisons at undisclosed location in parts of northeastern Syria, in territory controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces.    Nine Canadian women, often described as ISIS brides, and 18 children are being held at either Al-Roj or Al-Hawl, overcrowded refugee camps in northeastern Syria.     The captured ISIS members and their families here in Canada are pleading with Ottawa to help bring them home.  U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened that they would be released if Canada and European countries don't repatriate their nationals.   Ralph Goodale, Canada's minister of public safety, says the captured ISIS members ""have a constitutional right to re-enter the country, but the government of Canada does not have a legal obligation to facilitate their return.""  But Canada's approach has been criticized by some security experts.  Watch a security expert talk about Canada's policy:    Leah West, a former lawyer with the federal Department of Justice, describes the country's policy as one of ""inaction.""   Canada ""should bring them home and prosecute those that they have the evidence to prosecute for offences,"" said West, who teaches national security and intelligence at Carleton University in Ottawa.   Even though Abu Ridwan is confined to a Syrian prison, he told The Fifth Estate he has no regrets about the oath he took to defend and fight for the Islamic State.   ""In terms of actually being a part of the Islamic State, I don't regret that,"" said Abu Ridwan.  ""The fact that I'm a prisoner doesn't mean that I change my beliefs. It doesn't mean that I change my position with regards to my religion, with regards to the Sharia.""     No easy way to deradicalize hate group members, experts say    Another Canadian ISIS fighter who goes by the nom de guerre Abu Huzaifa said he spent seven months enforcing Sharia law for ISIS before returning to Canada in 2016.   In an interview with a New York Times reporter, Abu Huzaifa confessed to killing civilians in Syria, but he has not been charged with any crime.     The Fifth Estate approached Abu Huzaifa with a hidden camera at the place where he works in the Greater Toronto Area. He said he is in a counselling program with a local imam that is monitored by the RCMP and aimed at deradicalizing him.  Abu Huzaifa said he is not sure how the sessions are going or whether they are making any difference for him.   When asked what he thought about the captured ISIS fighters in Syria, men he still describes as ""his brothers,"" he said: ""If we bring these guys back, it shouldn't be that big of a problem, to be honest. I'm probably scarier than them walking around free because day by day I know I got off scot-free.",politics
244,"After years of broken promises, vets struggle with which party to support","Jay Jorgensen is unequivocal about much he trusts the Liberals and Conservatives to help disabled veterans like him.  ""Zero,"" says the retired sergeant, who served 17 years in uniform before leaving the military in 2013 because of a back injury and post-traumatic stress disorder. ""Both are burned to me.""  It's a popular sentiment in parts of Canada's veteran community — veterans themselves, their spouses and families and people who provide them services — and a reality both parties face as they seek to court a segment of the population that feels betrayed by successive governments over the past decade.  Canada's veterans' community is far from united, but it is large, with roughly 700,000 Canadians having served in uniform.  ""This number of potential voters is not without significance,"" Brian Forbes, chair of the National Council of Veteran Associations, wrote recently, ""particularly in an election year which will, in all probability, result in a minority government.""    Both the Conservatives and Liberals have made countless promises to Canada's veterans over the years, with Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer the latest to commit to making life better for those suffering from service-related wounds and illnesses.  Yet, while some are ready to look past their treatment by the previous Conservative government under Stephen Harper and accept Scheer's promises on faith after what they describe as Justin Trudeau's lies, others like Jorgensen are fed up and at a loss over whom to believe.  ""When you say something, that means to me that you will do it,"" Jorgensen says from his home north of Saskatoon. ""None of these parties have demonstrated that in the past, so I can't believe they will do it in the future either.""  The root of the distrust can be traced back to 2005, when Paul Martin's Liberal government did away with lifelong disability pensions, the backbone of Canada's support for those injured in uniform for nearly a century.  Changes that span years, governments  The New Veterans Charter was approved in the House of Commons with all-party support before Stephen Harper's Conservatives came to power in 2006 and his administration implemented it even as the war in Afghanistan was heating up.  Instead of pensions, veterans would receive lump-sum payments for injuries, plus rehabilitation programs and income-replacement support for those having difficulty finding work. The goal was to better help veterans adjust to civilian life after leaving the Forces.  Since then, the charter has undergone numerous changes — none of which have satisfied veterans who complain it provides far less financial support and who want the old pensions re-instated.  That demand manifested itself in the high-profile Equitas lawsuit filed in 2012 by six disabled Afghan war veterans, whom many former service members saw as champions for the cause of fairness for all ex-military personnel.  The Harper government also closed several Veterans Affairs Canada offices and slashed hundreds of department jobs — including frontline staff working directly with veterans — to balance the federal budget, resulting in huge delays in claims.  Watch: Andrew Scheer makes promises to veterans    If there was one moment that captured how bad the relationship between Harper's Conservatives and veterans got, it was when then-veterans affairs minister Julian Fantino in May 2014 refused to speak to the wife of a veteran struggling with PTSD who wanted more support for families and ducked out before she was scheduled to appear before a House committee.  Fantino was later replaced by Erin O'Toole, a former air-force officer who was starting to fix the Tories' relationship with veterans when Justin Trudeau took the stage during an election-campaign event in Belleville, Ont., on Aug. 24, 2015 and made his pitch.  In an appearance a few kilometres from CFB Trenton, Trudeau made a promise to veterans.  ""If I earn the right to serve this country as your prime minister, no veteran will be forced to fight their own government for the support and compensation that they have earned,"" Trudeau said in apparent reference to the Equitas lawsuit.  ""We will re-instate lifelong pensions and increase their value in line with the obligation we have made to those injured in the line of duty.""  It was exactly what many veterans had been waiting to hear. Four years later, however, faith in the Liberals has all but disappeared.  New plan not necessarily better  The Liberals re-opened the closed Veterans Affairs offices, increased some services and benefits for veterans and hired hundreds of staff at Veterans Affairs Canada. But the backlog of veterans waiting to hear whether they qualify for assistance has grown to nearly 40,000 as hiring and the department's budget failed to keep up with demand.  And not only did the Liberals continue to fight the Equitas lawsuit, which the Supreme Court tossed last year, they also failed to bring back the previous disability pensions and instead introduced their own version.  This past February, the parliamentary budget office reported disabled veterans would have received on average 1 1u002F2 times more over their lifetimes under the pre-2006 pension than through the Liberals' so-called Pension for Life.  That led to fresh allegations the government was trying to support veterans on the cheap.    And while the PBO found many veterans will see small increases in financial compensation compared with the 2005 charter, it also reported that some of the most severely disabled would actually receive less.  In January 2018, one month after the Liberals unveiled the Pension for Life, Trudeau was confronted during a townhall meeting in Edmonton by Brock Blaszczyk, who lost a leg in Afghanistan. Blaszczyk wanted to know: Why was the government still fighting the Equitas lawsuit?  ""Why are we still fighting against certain veterans' groups in court?"" Trudeau responded. ""Because they're asking for more than we are able to give right now.""  The comment still elicits outrage.  Promises and silence  Now Scheer is appealing to veterans to trust him. During a campaign event in Prince Edward Island last weekend, the Conservative Leader attacked Trudeau's record before laying out his own plan to help veterans.  Those include clearing the backlog of applications for assistance, introducing legislation enshrining in law a ""military covenant"" between the government and veterans, and creating a ""reliable, dependable pension system"" that is ""fair to Canada's most disabled veterans.""  The Liberals have yet to say what they will do for veterans. The NDP and the Greens have talked about a review of the current suite of benefits; the Greens say they will ""restore periodic payments"" at pre-2006 levels.  Retired major Mark Campbell was one of the plaintiffs in the Equitas case. While he is critical of the Harper government's treatment of vets, he is willing to give Scheer a chance.  ""Looking forward right now, as I see it, we have a set of promises from the Conservatives that look actually quite good at first blush and we have a deafening silence from the Liberals.""  Others such as retired master corporal Paul Franklin, who made headlines for having to prove to Veterans Affairs each year that he had lost both legs in Afghanistan, remain more circumspect.  ""We don't trust these guys,"" Franklin said. ""It almost comes down to a point where we either have to vote local or vote on other reasons and sadly forget our own reasons to vote as a group or make the individual choice if you wish to trust the leadership.""  Back at his home near Saskatoon, Jorgensen already knows what he is going to do: ""I will be striking my ballot,"" he says. ""I will be striking my ballot.""",politics
245,What do the federal parties offer Quebecers in the fight against greenhouse gas emissions?,"Even before Friday's mammoth climate march in Montreal, polls were suggesting the environment is a key priority for Quebec voters in this campaign.  Voters' awareness of the perils facing the planet have only been heightened, feeding their demand for public policies that have a real impact on global warming.  So what is an environmentally conscious voter to do come election day on Oct. 21?    There are many ways to evaluate the different party promises on the environment. You could, for example, look at where each party stands on carbon pricing or compare their respective conservation proposals.   But unlike some other provinces, the chief source of greenhouse gas emissions in Quebec is transportation. Indeed, it is the only sector of the economy that has seen a significant increase in emissions.    And no surprise: gas-guzzling vehicles are the problem. In 2016, cars accounted for 34 per cent of all transportation emissions in the province; light trucks accounted for 30 per cent and heavy trucks, 36 per cent, according to the Quebec Ministry of the Environment and the Fight Against Climate Change.  So, any serious effort to reduce emissions will have to involve finding greener ways for Quebecers to get around.   OK, so where do the parties stand on electric vehicles?  In its last budget, the Liberal government introduced a $5,000 tax credit on zero-emission vehicles. The NDP has promised to maintain that credit if it is elected.  The Bloc Québécois's platform includes several proposals to expand that tax credit, including boosting it by $1,500 for low-income earners.  ""That could allow people who never thought of buying an electric vehicle to say: 'Oh, now it's affordable,'"" said the Bloc's leader, Yves-François Blanchet.    The Greens, meanwhile, are promising to ban outright the sale of internal combustion engine passenger vehicles by 2030, while also making electrical vehicles tax-free.  For their part, the Conservatives haven't committed to keeping the electric vehicle tax credit. Their environment platform mentions working with the provinces and industry groups to develop longer-lasting batteries for electric vehicles.  What about public transit?  Another, perhaps simpler, way of reducing vehicle emissions is to get people to drive less. That means increasing mass transit.  ""Public transit needs to be at the heart of the climate change debate,"" said Samuel Pagé-Plouffe, a spokesperson for the Quebec lobby group Transit.    Pagé-Plouffe said Liberal government's creation of a dedicated fund for public transit infrastructure projects helped get several projects in Quebec off the ground, including the extension of the Blue Line in Montreal and the tramway network in Quebec City.  ""We're now at historical levels for dedicated funds for public transit at the federal level,"" Pagé-Plouffe said, though he noted the federal program is complicated for municipalities to navigate.    The NDP has pledged to spend a further $6.5 billion on public transit projects across the country. It's not clear how much would be earmarked for Quebec.    When it comes to more specific proposals, the Greens say they support the Pink Line, a proposed addition to the Montreal Metro system that hasn't interested the provincial government.   The Conservatives have vowed to re-introduce a tax credit — cut by the Liberals — that would reduce the cost of weekly and monthly transit passes by 15 per cent.    Pagé-Plouffe said though that measure would make public transit more affordable, it doesn't address a more pressing problem — the shortage of existing public transit options.  As for the Bloc, there is no mention at all of public transit funding in the party's campaign platform.    What about new roads?  Another way of reducing transport emissions in Quebec entails rethinking what roads are built, and where.  For years, economists have been trying to draw the attention of elected officials to the law of induced demand.  When applied to urban planning, this economic principle holds that building more roads or widening existing roads actually increases congestion.    That's because road construction acts as an incentive for people to take their car, and all that extra pavement gets swamped with traffic just as soon as it is built. So more cars, more congestion and more greenhouse gas emissions.  One way to counteract this effect is by imposing tolls. Another is to simply avoid building unnecessary roads and highways in the first place.  The proposed tunnel between Quebec City and Lévis, which the provincial government is pressing ahead with, has become a battleground for environmental groups trying to make that point.    They argue the link would not only be expensive (estimates range between $4 billion and $10 billion) and serve no discernible need (it connects an area responsible for only one per cent of Quebec City's traffic), but that it would only increase emissions by encouraging more people to drive.  The NDP and the Greens have stated their firm opposition to the tunnel, dubbed the ""third link.""   The Liberals haven't taken a position on the issue.  Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet, for his part, said he's ""not against"" the third link.  Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer enthusiastically endorses it. ""As prime minister, the third link will be my priority,"" Scheer said during a visit to Quebec City earlier this week.",politics
246,The path to government on Oct. 21 begins on East Coast,"Vote-rich urban areas such as Ontario's 416u002F905 region and British Columbia's Lower Mainland tend to dominate campaign coverage, but there is also a battle brewing on Canada's East Coast.  The first sign of which party has the best chance of forming the next government on Oct. 21 will come from Atlantic Canada, where a surging red tide in 2015 saw Justin Trudeau's Liberals win all 32 seats, including the 10 in New Brunswick.  Conservative candidate Rob Moore said he believes his party is poised to make gains in 2019.  ""The Liberals are not going to win all 32 seats this time, let's put it that way,"" said Moore, who is running in New Brunswick's Fundy Royal riding.  As one of three Harper-era MPs who are trying to win back seats lost in 2015 in neighbouring ridings across the southern part of the province, Moore says the path to power in Atlantic Canada is all about the economy.  ""People are going to go where there's economic opportunity,"" he said in an interview with CBC Radio's The House at his campaign office in Quispamsis, N.B., about 15 kilometres northeast of Saint John.    ""We have a government in Ottawa, the Liberal Trudeau government, that's standing in the way of economic growth and seems to have done everything possible to put a wet blanket over our New Brunswick economy, principally with the cancellation of Energy East and now with the carbon tax,"" Moore said.  In 2017, TransCanada abandoned plans to build the Energy East pipeline to carry heavy oil from Alberta to an export terminal in Saint John. The company cited new federal emissions standards in the regulatory review of the project.  But Moore's Conservatives aren't the only party hoping to change the colour of New Brunswick's electoral map this year.  Five of the six federal party leaders have visited the province during the campaign (Bloc Quebecois Leader Yves-François Blanchet is the exception).  Greens aim to capitalize on provincial success  Green Party Leader Elizabeth May is keen to build on the success of the provincial Green party, which won three seats in a New Brunswick provincial election earlier this year, including one in Fredericton held by provincial Green leader David Coon.  ""I'm very proud of our platform. It provides solutions across the whole range of things that are on the minds of Canadians,"" May said Monday during a campaign stop in the provincial capital.    Jenica Atwin, the party's candidate in Fredericton, said she hopes to be part of a Green caucus in Ottawa that will hold the balance of power in a minority government.  ""The Greens aren't going to form government Oct. 21,"" she said. ""We are hoping to hold enough seats that we can make a difference and hold whichever government is in power accountable on these key issues.""    But Atwin's got her work cut out for her in Fredericton, where Liberal incumbent Matt DeCourcey won almost half the vote in 2015.  ""I think people understand just how important the choice is this time,"" he said from his campaign office in downtown Fredericton.  DeCourcey says the Liberal campaign platform is a ""practical plan"" to support the middle class, seniors and post-secondary students — a key demographic in a city with two universities.    But even he acknowledges a sense of apprehension or uncertainty among voters who feel like they just can't get ahead.  ""I think people understand that, even in a time of uncertainty, they have a party and a government that is implementing programs and opportunities that can help them with the skills training and the opportunities to participate fully in community,"" he said.  Elsewhere in the province, Ginette Petitpas-Taylor, who was health minister at the time of dissolution, is seeking re-election in a Moncton-area riding, while longtime MP Dominic LeBlanc is running again in Beausejour, despite stepping back from his cabinet duties earlier this year to undergo treatment for cancer.   NDP's Singh 'sorry I didn't get here earlier'  .Meanwhile, the NDP faces an uphill battle in New Brunswick.  Even before the campaign officially kicked off earlier this month, there were reports 14 former New Democrat candidates from the last provincial election had jumped ship to the Greens because they were unhappy with Jagmeet Singh's lack of focus on Atlantic Canada.  There was also a suggestion made by Jonathan Richardson, a former federal NDP executive member who also quit the party, that racism might be undermining support for Singh, who is Sikh.    The NDP, however, claimed five of the members alleged to have left for the Greens did no such thing.  Nevertheless, Singh faced criticism for not stepping foot in the province since he became NDP leader in 2017.    Singh addressed that during a campaign stop this week in the northern New Brunswick riding of Acadie-Bathurst, which Yvon Godin held for the NDP for 18 years. He apologized to party supporters.  ""I'm sorry that I didn't get here earlier. I'm honoured to be here,"" Singh said. ""It's a beautiful place.""  ",politics
247,Jagmeet Singh says he 'wasn't joking' on hoping Donald Trump is impeached,"NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh told a town hall audience in Victoria that he was serious when he said that he hopes U.S. President Donald Trump is impeached.  Asked Friday by CBC News if it was wise for someone running to be prime minister to joke, as he did the previous evening, that he hoped Trump would be impeached, Singh replied, ""I wasn't joking.""  The line garnered applause from the audience.   On Thursday evening, the NDP leader said he hopes Trump ""gets impeached"" when asked what would he say first to the U.S. president if he was prime minister.   ""I hope he gets impeached before I get to speak to him,"" said Singh, while hosting a town hall event in Nanaimo, B.C. ""I say that a little tongue-in-cheek.""    Singh said it is ""disgusting that the president could inflame hatred against people and be so divisive.""  ""It's horrible that someone in a position of power like him would allow for kids to be stripped from the arms of their parents, from their moms,"" he said. ""That needs to be denounced.""    Singh has already heavily criticized Trump for the U.S. government's separation of migrant children from their parents in immigration detention centres at the U.S.-Mexico border.   ""You can't allow someone like that to do that without any sort of repercussion, without anyone else condemning that,"" Singh said Thursday night. ""And I condemn it.""  Trump is facing impeachment proceedings after a whistleblower reported that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the son of Joe Biden, Trump's potential 2020 Democratic challenger, in a July phone call. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday the Democratic-controlled House would begin impeachment proceedings.  On Saturday morning, when asked about how his comments could impact the U.S. relationship with Canada, Singh said he thinks Canadians want strength.   ""Canadians expect to have someone who's going to stand up to Mr. Trump,"" he told reporters.   ""Canadians don't want someone … who is going to back down from a bully.""   Singh's comments on impeachment  Singh is the first of the Canadian party leaders to comment directly on the possible impeachment of Trump. But his position seems to have evolved over the past four days.    ""Congress members will make the decision,"" Singh said in French on Wednesday outside Vancouver's city hall during a media conference. ""I think there's a lot of proof to move forward with these proceedings.""  By contrast, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau and Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer this week simply declared they would keep an eye on how things evolved when asked how they thought the impeachment proceedings may affect ratification of the renegotiated North American trade deal.

248,Man who shared Trudeau blackface photo says Canadians had a right to see it,"The man who says he sent the infamous blackface photo of Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau to Time magazine said he did so because the Canadian public had a right to see it.  Last week, the American newsmagazine dropped a bombshell on the Canadian election campaign when it reported that Trudeau dressed in blackface and a turban back in 2001 for a gala event West Point Grey Academy, the private B.C. school Trudeau taught at 18 years ago.  Time reported that it had obtained the photo from Vancouver businessman Michael Adamson, who was identified as being ""part of the West Point Grey Academy community,"" but Adamson himself has remained silent.  Until now. Adamson released a statement Friday addressing the controversy.  ""Earlier this month I communicated with a reporter from Time magazine regarding the existence of a photograph showing Justin Trudeau wearing brownface at an event while he was a teacher at West Point Grey Academy,"" he said in a written statement.    ""As a past member of the WPGA community, I had been aware of gossip surrounding the existence of this photograph and was in a position to provide a copy of it from the school yearbook to the Time reporter.""  Adamson said he has never been a member of a political party and received no payment for releasing the image.  ""My decision to provide it to Time magazine was motivated solely by the belief that the Canadian public had a right to see it,"" he said.    Adamson said his written statement will be the only public comment he'll be making on the matter.  ""I ask the media and others to respect my privacy and that of my family.""  CBC News approached Adamson at his Vancouver home on Friday and Adamson declined to speak further.  Watch: CBC's Eric Rankin tries to interview Michael Adamson, the Vancouver businessman who supplied Time magazine with the Trudeau blackface photo    Photo upended election campaign  When Time magazine published its explosive report, it said little about Adamson beyond his connection to the school and how the photo came to his attention.  ""He said that he first saw the photograph in July and felt it should be made public,"" Time reported.  The report immediately upended the federal election campaign and prompted media organizations, including CBC News, to seek out Adamson for further comment and to learn more about the man. Many details that CBC News has confirmed were first reported by the Globe and Mail on Thursday night.  Over the years, Adamson and his wife have donated thousands of dollars to private schools in the Vancouver area, including West Point Grey Academy, which their son Bennet attended early in his education.  In 2003 and 2004, Adamson and his wife Kumi Adamson were listed as ""diamond sponsors"" of the West Point gala, online archives show. A diamond sponsor is defined by the school as someone donating $5,000 or more.  In later years, the couple donated at least $100,000 to another private school, St. George's, from which Bennet graduated in 2015.    Bennet is seen in St. George's newsletters and student publications as a member of the school's rowing team, and DJing a school dance.  The Adamsons also donated thousands of dollars to local charities, including the PALS Autism Society and the Vancouver Public Library.  Fred Lee, a Vancouver society columnist and a regular contributor to CBC Vancouver, said Adamson ""is a generous individual who has supported many charities.""  A source who knows Adamson personally told CBC News that he is ""definitely not a rabid conservative.""  Connection between Adamson and Time  Bennet Adamson appears to be the key link connecting his father with the Time reporter, Anna Purna Kambhampaty, who broke the story.  Adamson and Kambhampaty both attended Cornell University, where Adamson is studying architecture. Kambhampaty graduated in June with a bachelor's degree in information science.  Kambhampaty posted a photo of herself holding a giant Toblerone chocolate bar on her Instagram account the same month, thanking Bennet Adamson for giving her a graduation gift.  Since the Time story was published, Kambhampaty deleted her Instagram account, but CBC News was able to get an archived version of the photo.  Kambhampaty was a member of the Kappa Delta sorority at Cornell, while Adamson was a member of the Delta Chi fraternity. The two organizations hosted fundraiser events and parties together during the time both were attending the school.  Kambhampaty wrote about going to see the band Vampire Weekend perform with her friend Bennet in April, in a column for the Cornell Sun paper. In another section of the same column, she said Bennet is a ""dear friend.""    Records also show Michael and Kumi Adamson fund the ""Adamson Family Cornell Future Architect Award"" and previously donated to the Cornell University College of Architecture, Art and Planning's annual fund.  In an interview with NPR after the story was released, Kambhampaty said she had heard about the photo ""as a source of gossip in Vancouver community and contacted a source to see the photo and was sent the yearbook.""  She added that the gossip was circulating among ""people who had formerly worked there, parents, former parents. It wasn't widely talked about, but a few people were talking about it.""  Complaints filed to Elections Canada  Since the Time story published, conspiracy theories about how the photo was acquired have circulated online.   Some Twitter users have pointed out that a Michael F. Adamson in Toronto is listed as a donor to the Conservative Party of Canada as well as Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer. However, that's not the right Michael Adamson; the Michael Adamson who supplied the photo's middle initial is R, not F, and he is based in Vancouver, not Toronto.    Others online questioned whether Adamson even existed, and wondered why the photo was supplied to an American outlet and not a Canadian one. But Adamson's son's relationship with the Time reporter sheds some light on how they may have connected.  Concerns over the story sparked complaints to the Office of the Commissioner of Canada Elections, a spokesperson told CBC News.  ""I can confirm that our office has received complaints, but can't say more beyond that,"" Myriam Croussette, senior communications advisor for the Office of the Commissioner of Canada Elections, wrote in an email. ""There are provisions in the Canada Elections Act that prohibit undue influence by foreigners. However, these provisions include exceptions with regard to the transmission of news to the public through media.""  Separately, the Security and Intelligence Threats to Elections Task Force — which monitors potential foreign interference in the October election campaign — told CBC News it ""does not have any publicly available assessments to share"" regarding the photo.  The task force is chaired by the Communications Security Establishment, the country's signals intelligence agency, and includes the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, the RCMP and Global Affairs Canada.",politics
249,Would the Liberals' climate plan really add 31 cents to pump prices?,"As part of our federal election coverage, CBC News is assessing the truthfulness and accuracy of statements made by politicians and their parties.  The Claim: ""We know that, in addition to the carbon tax, the Liberals are proposing a fuel standard which would increase the cost per litre of gasoline by a tremendous amount — altogether increasing the cost of a litre of gasoline by over 30 cents a litre.""  — Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer  The Facts:  Central to the Conservatives' campaign message is the claim that Liberal efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions would cost Canadians more at the pumps. Andrew Scheer has promised that a Conservative government would scrap two central pillars of the Liberal Party's climate change plan: carbon pricing and a proposed clean fuel standard.  The Conservatives say that, combined, the two measures would increase the cost of one litre of gasoline by 31.1 cents. A new ad rolled out by the campaign this week features that figure prominently.    Background materials circulated by the party shed light on how it came to that conclusion. The carbon tax, the Conservatives say, adds 22.5 cents to each litre, while the clean fuel standard would add 5 cents. Add those two numbers together, factor in HST and you get to 31.1 cents.  Is that calculation an accurate estimate of what Canadians could expect to pay under the Liberal plan? Not really.   The Conservatives' math depends on a number of assumed outcomes linked to carbon pricing that the Liberals have said wouldn't happen if they are re-elected. Their math depends on a figure for the clean fuel standard pulled from a think-tank report. But one of the authors of that report argues the Conservatives are neglecting critical context.  Justin Trudeau's government first announced its intention to impose a clean fuel standard in 2016. The regulation is meant to encourage the development and use of low-carbon fuels throughout the economy and give industry an incentive to come up with new clean technologies.  The Liberals have said that their policy would focus first on liquid fuels, like gasoline and diesel, and eventually apply to gaseous and solid fuels as well. The first phase wouldn't come into effect until 2022.    Environment and Climate Change Canada estimates the clean fuel standard could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30 megatonnes per year by 2030, making it one of the core elements of the Liberal strategy to meet Canada's Paris Agreement commitments.  But what it ultimately would cost Canadians is up for debate. Sean Fraser, a Liberal candidate and parliamentary secretary to the minister of environment, said earlier this year that it is still too early ""to do an accounting"" on costs linked to a policy that was not fully developed at the time.  Clean Energy Canada, a think-tank based at Simon Fraser University, analyzed the potential impacts and costs of the clean fuel standard and published its findings in a 2017 report.  The authors concluded it would increase the price of gasoline by between one and two cents in 2022 before eventually adding 5 cents per litre by 2030 — the figure the Tories are using in calculations.    Overall, the clean fuel standard would cost the average Canadian household about $5 per month in 2030, the report found.  But Dan Woynillowicz, policy director at Clean Energy Canada, said it makes little sense to look at those projections in isolation.  The same report found that any increases in the price of fuels caused by the clean fuel standard would be ""considerably outweighed,"" on average, by savings derived from other climate change fighting measures. Those measures include things like high-efficiency furnaces, modernized building standards and the proliferation of hybrid and fully electric vehicles.    ""We found that while the clean fuel standard will cost the average household $5 a month in 2030, that same household's energy costs will have declined $22 by then, meaning they're actually coming out ahead to the tune of $17 a month,"" Woynillowicz said.  Clean Energy Canada released a statement this week accusing the Conservative campaign of misrepresenting the report's key findings and cherry-picking statistics.  $102 per tonne carbon tax?  And what about the potential for price increases driven by the carbon tax?  In their math, the Conservatives have pegged the carbon tax at $102 per tonne. That figure comes from a report issued by the Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO), which concluded that the price of carbon would have to rise to that level by 2030 for Canada to hit its Paris Agreement target.  But the carbon tax currently amounts to $20 per tonne of emissions, which would increase to $30 per tonne next year and to $50 a tonne by 2022 under the Liberal plan — adding about 11 cents to the cost of a litre of gasoline.    After the PBO published its report, Liberal candidate and federal Environment Minister Catherine McKenna said that the government had ""no plan to increase the price post-2022. For Conservatives to suggest otherwise is simply false and misleading.""    She also pointed to the fact that the carbon tax and clean fuel standard are not the only tools at a government's disposal in the fight against climate change. The Liberals' plan to phase out coal-powered electricity by 2030, for example, would result in significant emissions reductions in the coming decade.  A Liberal government could also opt to use more stringent regulations — such as ramping up fuel efficiency requirements for cars and trucks — in concert with other measures to reach Canada's 2030 goal, Woynillowicz said.  ""This isn't a binary thing where if we don't raise the price of carbon there's no way we'll hit our Paris targets, or if we raise the price of carbon we absolutely will meet the targets. It's not that straightforward,"" he said.  In an interview with the Globe and Mail in August, McKenna said a Liberal government could re-evaluate the carbon price near end of its mandate but did not say it would actually increase.  It's not currently known if a carbon price of $102 per tonne would ever happen. So the Conservatives may be overestimating the potential impact on gas prices.

250,Green Party backs its candidate after leader Elizabeth May attends Jody Wilson-Raybould rally,"The Green Party says it stands behind candidate Louise Boutin in Vancouver Granville after party leader Elizabeth May was seen at a rally this month supporting independent candidate Jody Wilson-Raybould.   Wilson-Raybould, who was expelled from the Liberal caucus last spring after fallout from the SNC-Lavalin affair, declined to join the Green Party last spring and chose instead to run as an independent.  May went to the Sept. 18 Vancouver rally for Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott, who is also seeking re-election as an independent. Dubbed as a ""night for independent voices,"" May spoke behind a podium that said ""re-elect Jody Wilson-Raybould.""  Louise Boutin, the Green Party candidate, is running against Wilson-Raybould. She says she knew May was going to the rally to support someone she considers a longtime friend and she harbours no ill-will against the leader.     ""Elizabeth did back Jody because of what happened in Parliament,"" Boutin said. ""She was really distraught and upset about what the prime minister did at the time and she wanted to support her in her run.""  'Greens do politics differently'  Boutin said the Green Party's mandate is to have a candidate in every riding and that she feels supported by her party.     Wilson-Raybould said she was pleased that May attended the rally in support of herself and Philpott.  ""I appreciate her support in a lot of the things that I have gone through over the last nine months to a year. But more broadly than that, I appreciate her similar views around creating a less partisan environment in the House of Commons,"" she said.

""Both the party and Elizabeth May fully support Louise Boutin's candidacy in Vancouver Granville.""",politics
251,Which party would have the clout in a minority Parliament?,"Jagmeet Singh and Elizabeth May have been taking turns declaring how uncompromising they would be if this fall's election doesn't result in a clear majority for any single party and post-election negotiations are required to decide who controls the House of Commons.  It's early yet — too early to predict with any confidence how the rest of this campaign will play out. But it's never too early to start looking ahead. And it's already fair to wonder whether any Liberal or Conservative minority government would be able to satisfy the New Democrats or Greens.  Then again, that question assumes the New Democrats or Greens would end up holding the balance of power in a minority Parliament.  The latest jockeying involves the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project.  Speaking to CBC News on Wednesday, May said she would not support a government that was committed to building the expansion. Though he wasn't quite as categorical as May, Singh later said he would remain opposed to the project.    The question of who would support what has become a significant subplot in the NDP-Green fight for third place.  It began in July, when May said she would support any government that was willing to take sufficient action against climate change. A month later, after the Liberals unearthed video of Andrew Scheer condemning same-sex marriage in 2005, Singh declared that he would never prop up a Conservative government.  Singh then tried to use his position to draw a distinction between his party and the Greens.  ""We strongly believe that we should not be putting Mr. Scheer in the prime minister's seat, unlike Ms. May and the Green Party, who believe that's the right choice,"" Singh said at the first leaders' debate in September.  May called that claim ""absurd"" and clarified that she would not support any government that failed to present a climate plan in line with the goal of limiting further global warming to 1.5 C.  A Conservative minority in a tight corner  That line in the sand has now been extended to include the Trans Mountain expansion.  Andrew Scheer's available options for winning the confidence of the House in a minority scenario would thus seem to be limited — not only because the NDP has categorically ruled itself out, but also because May's conditions seem particularly unlikely to be met by a minority Conservative government.    As Chantal Hébert wrote this week in the Toronto Star, it appears the Conservatives will need their own majority to follow through on their promises to repeal existing climate policies.  But it's also fair to wonder whether Justin Trudeau would be at all willing to satisfy the conditions being thrown up by the NDP and the Greens.    The Liberals might be persuaded to implement more aggressive climate policies — but would Trudeau walk away from the Trans Mountain expansion? After expending a lot of political capital and committing significant public funds to the project — and knowing how Albertans would react to its cancellation — it seems unlikely, at least.  Singh's words on Thursday might suggest some room to negotiate. Perhaps the NDP leader could remain opposed to the expansion without demanding that it be cancelled.  The electoral reform wild card  But Singh has laid out another condition already. Back in 2017, he told Fair Vote Canada that he would ""consult with our caucus and advocate for the inclusion of proportional representation as a condition of any alliance or support for a minority government.""  Given Trudeau's publicly stated objections to proportional representation (and his misgivings about referendums), he might be just as unwilling to meet a demand for electoral reform.  It would be somewhat curious if the two parties that are most loudly in favour of proportional representation — the NDP and Greens — turned out to be rather uncompromising in their demands on a minority government.  Part of the argument for moving to a system of proportional representation is that it typically would result in two or more parties having to work together to pass legislation. A campaign card recently distributed in the riding of Ottawa Centre by Fair Vote Canada, for instance, promises that proportional representation would mean ""co-operative decision making.""    In the current circumstances, the prospect of a minority government seems instead to be producing a contest to decide which of the smaller parties can make the hardest demands.  Absent some post-election compromises, someone would be left having to explain why another election was necessary.  But all of this pre-result posturing for post-election negotiations might ultimately be for nothing.  It's still possible that one party will end up with a majority in the House of Commons. But there is also the distinct possibility that neither the Greens nor the New Democrats will be in a position to deliver pivotal votes to a minority government.  Advantage: Bloc  Based on the latest polling, the Liberals would — if an election were held today — end up with 160 seats, 10 short of a bare majority. The Greens, with four seats, would be unable to offer a Liberal government a sufficient number of votes.  The New Democrats, with 16 seats, would be able to put the Liberals over the top. But so would the Bloc Québécois, currently projected to win 17 seats.  Indeed, while the Greens and New Democrats have been battling for position in British Columbia and Ontario, the BQ has quietly put itself in a position where it could have real influence in the next Parliament.  Singh and May are no doubt free to stake out their negotiating positions now. But they might not even get invited to the table.  ",politics

It's been a difficult file for Canada to manage, including weathering a long, rocky renegotiation of the North American trade pact formerly known as NAFTA.  In June 2018, the United States slapped new tariffs on Canada: 25 per cent on imports of steel and 10 per cent on aluminum, citing national security. Canada retaliated with tariffs on U.S. steel, aluminum and other consumer products.  After months of tense talks and refusal by Canada to ratify the new trade deal unless the tariffs were dropped, the U.S. agreed to lift them nearly a year later.   ",politics

In an interview this week with CBC News, Uppal, who grew up in Mill Woods, said he and his family decided to move to Ottawa shortly after he was first elected as the MP for Edmonton-Sherwood Park in 2008.  It was a matter of trying to find a balance, he said.  ""And so I have a young family and we chose that we would move them to Ottawa where I have more opportunity to be with them,"" Uppal said. ""My wife is a lawyer for Foreign Affairs so we set up shop there.""  Candidates not required to live in riding  The Canada Elections Act says a candidate running for a seat in the House of Commons must ""have established residency somewhere in Canada but not necessarily in the constituency where he or she is seeking election.""  Winning candidates can choose to live in Ottawa, their home riding, or anywhere else across the country.  Right now, incumbent Sohi and challenger Uppal are locked in a rematch of their 2015 face-off. The other candidates in Edmonton Mill Woods are Nigel Logan for the NDP, Don Melanson for the Christian Heritage Party, Annie Young for the People's Party of Canada and Tanya Herbert for the Green Party.  In 2015, Sohi, a former Edmonton city councillor, defeated Uppal in Edmonton Mill Woods by the narrow margin of 92 votes. This time around, Sohi is leaning on his long record of public service and his close ties to the community to win the seat again.  He said casual encounters with his Edmonton neighbours open up conversations he wouldn't  have had otherwise.  ""My family is here, my friends are here,"" Sohi told CBC.    ""You know, my neighbours expect me to be seen and they can knock on my door, and people often do.  ""They know that if I'm home I'll answer the door. If I'm not home they'll call my office.""  Uppal said he believes a strong community connection is vital, but that it can be achieved without living in the riding.  Connect and commute  Uppal said he has never stopped connecting with Edmonton residents, regardless of where his immediate family lives.  Instead, he said, he gets opportunities to devote more time to constituents when he is back in the city.  ""When I'm here and I'm at events and meeting with people, it doesn't finish until 10, 11, 12 at night. That's fine because I'm going home to an empty house anyway.""    Sohi, the minister of natural resources in Justin Trudeau's government, said long hours and being away from home are ""part of the job"" — and something he and his family struggled with when he was a rookie city councillor.   ""It's a choice that we as elected officials or politicians make to serve the public,"" he said. ""And we make that decision consciously, understanding the sacrifices and difficulties we're going to face.""  Asked about MPs who choose to live full-time in Ottawa, Sohi said it wouldn't work for him.  ""For me to do my job properly, living in the community that I represent is so important.""  At an event last weekend at the Knottwood community league, a large crowd was on hand to enjoy the sunshine, music and hot dogs.    Edmonton Mill Woods constituent George McCarthy said it's important for him to have an MP who lives in the riding, someone you might bump into at gatherings like the community league picnic.  ""And if the guy lives somewhere else, maybe lives in Ottawa or lives somewhere else, you can't talk to him,"" McCarthy said. ""You can communicate [through] emails, whatever, but it's not the same.""  But others said they aren't so sure.    Michelle Kroetsch, who also lives in Mill Woods, said she feels being a part of the community is important, but there are ways to engage with the public, without living there.  ""We can also tune into things on the internet, Facebook, they can do live events differently that can make people part of it. So I don't think it's as important anymore as technologies develop,"" Kroetsch said.    At the Desh Punjab radio station in Mill Woods, owner Kulmit Sangha said most of his listeners want an MP who can relate to what they are experiencing.  ""Well, they certainly prefer if the candidate is living in the area,"" Sangha said. ""They would like to see somebody here for sure.""  Tough on family life  The Samara Centre for Democracy, based in Toronto, has done numerous exit interviews with departing MPs. Senior research associate Paul Thomas said the evidence shows that for an MP with a young family, travelling back and forth to Ottawa is challenging and takes a toll.    ""The solution Mr. Uppal is proposing makes sense in some regard,"" Thomas said in an interview.  For the most part, citizens don't engage directly with their MP, but instead with the politician's constituency staff, Thomas said. In that case it really doesn't matter if the MP is in the constituency, or in Ottawa, he said.   ""Finding ways to make Parliament more inclusive so that we can have a diverse set of representatives [with] people who have small kids, people who have older kids — will improve public policy especially when so much of the debate right now is about how to make life more affordable for families,"" Thomas said.  In an email response from the House of Commons, communications officer Kori Ghergari said all members are required to declare their living arrangements at the start of each new Parliament by completing a primary and secondary residences form.  ""Members who have a residence in the constituency and in the National Capital Region must indicate which one is the primary residence and which one is the secondary residence and provide supporting documentation,"" Ghergari said in the statement.",politics
254,Conservatives say Liberal campaign is copying Tory policy ideas,"For the third time in this federal election campaign, the Liberal Party has rolled out a policy proposal similar to one already promised by its Conservative counterparts — and some Tories are complaining the governing party is cribbing from the Conservative playbook.  On tax measures to help the middle class, on parental and maternity benefits and with green home renovation incentives, the two parties have released policies that are very much alike with some notable tweaks.  ""Our whole platform is ready for the entire campaign — and they just follow behind us. Clearly, we're leading, we're leading the campaign and they are saying 'OK, it's a good policy, let's copy it,'"" Conservative candidate Pierre-Paul Hus, the incumbent candidate for Charlesbourg—Haute-Saint-Charles, said in an interview on the sidelines of a campaign stop in Quebec City.  ""Maybe they think people don't follow the news. It's unusual in a federal campaign to have this kind of situation ... to copy. But, maybe, it's good for us because they see we have some engagement and they follow behind,"" he said.  On Wednesday, Scheer re-announced a major plank of his climate change plan — a two-year, $1.8 billion promise to give tax credits for green-friendly home renovations — only to see the Liberal Party promise a similar measure — an interest-free loan program for renos — later that day.  The former Conservative government was the first to establish such a home renovation program in 2009 as a recession-fighting measure. Former prime minister Stephen Harper promised during the last federal campaign to revive the program — it had been discontinued as the government sought to get back to a balanced budget. The plan didn't see the light of day when Harper lost and the new Liberal government enacted other environmental plans.  The NDP and Green Party have also announced ambitious home retrofit policies aimed at making the country's buildings —which account for 12 per cent of the country's greenhouse gas emissions — cleaner.  Parental, maternity benefits  There are also notable similarities on the parental and maternity benefits file.  Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer introduced a private member's bill in Parliament in February 2018, which would have provided a non-refundable, 15 per cent tax credit to cover the taxes incurred on employment insurance (EI) benefits for new parents. Scheer said a person earning a salary of $50,000, who then goes on EI benefits after a birth, would save about $4,000.  The Liberal Party voted against the legislation with the party's MPs saying they'd rather stick with the Canada Child Benefit (CCB).  ""The CCB is simpler, more generous, and better targeted to give more help to people who need it most,"" Liberal MP Adam Vaughan said of the Scheer policy, dismissing the bill as ""a gimmick, stunt, slogan.""  However, not to be outdone at election time, the Liberal Party countered the Conservative promise with its own plan for new parents on EI days later.    As opposed to a tax credit, the Liberal Party promised to make those EI benefits entirely tax-free at source, meaning would-be beneficiaries won't have to wait for a refund at tax time.  Tax cuts  On tax cuts, the Liberal Party has also sought to go toe-to-toe with the Tories.  The Liberals do have a recent track record of cutting personal income tax rates for middle-income Canadians. In the last Parliament, the Liberal government cut the the second income bracket rate — on the portion of taxable income between $47,630 and $95,259 — to 20.5 percent from 22 percent.  The priciest commitment of Scheer's campaign to this point is a ""universal"" tax cut, a $6-billion promise that will give couples tax-relief worth about $850 a year.    To accomplish this, like the Liberals before them, the Conservatives said they would cut the tax rate on taxable income under $47,630 to 13.75 per cent from 15 per cent.  Days after the blackface pictures of Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau surfaced, the Liberals promised to make the first $15,000 of income tax-free for most Canadians.  The party will offer its cuts by raising the basic personal income tax amount by $2,000 by 2023 for people earning under $147,000 a year. This plan will save the average taxpayer roughly $292 a year.  The Conservatives maintain even if there are similarities between the two party platforms, the Tory approach on taxes will better help lower-income Canadians (someone earning under $47,000 would receive $147 more a year in relief under the Conservative tax cut plan.)  'We take absolutely no lessons from the Conservative plan'   A spokesperson for the campaign provided figures that suggest its maternity benefit will also be more equitable across income brackets, with wealthier Canadians gaining more from the Liberal iteration.  While the Conservative tax credit tops out at $4,200, a person earning $120,000 a year would see more than $7,200 in tax relief with the Liberal proposal.  ""One thing is clear in this election, under Justin Trudeau life will only get more unaffordable and he will continue to raise taxes on all Canadians. We are proud to be offering our positive Conservative vision to Canadians with policies that will help you get ahead,"" Jamie Ellerton, the manager of media relations for the campaign tour, said in a statement.    A Liberal Party spokesperson denied they were borrowing policy ideas from Scheer.  ""We take absolutely no lessons from the Conservative plan to take our country backwards,"" Eleanore Catenaro said.  ""Every single policy that Andrew Scheer has announced borrows directly from Stephen Harper's failed policies of the past or benefits the wealthiest few while leaving behind Canadians who truly need it most. We shouldn't be surprised – that's what Conservative politicians do,"" she said.",politics

258,"Green platform has some big fiscal holes, hidden costs ","The Claim: ""The Green Party [has] followed through on its promise to present Canadians with a detailed accounting of the new spending and revenue measures outlined in the party's 2019 Platform.""  -- A Green Party media release, Sept. 25th.   The Facts:  On Wednesday, the Green Party released an eight-page document breaking down the economic costs and benefits of its election promises running through the 2023-24 fiscal year, becoming the first federal party to attach a price tag to its program.  The overview projects $62.2 billion in new government revenue and $69.9 billion in ""spending changes"" in 2020-21, with an overall $22.7 billion deficit. But the party claims that it will shrink the deficit by $10 billion the following year, and be running a $401 million surplus by 2023-24.  The document also provides budget details for 16 revenue changes, ranging from capital gains adjustments to a wealth tax, and 86 spending promises including universal pharmacare, free post-secondary tuition and the elimination of student debt, and the development of a national food waste strategy.  However, a number of other major party promises — like phasing out oilsands production, increasing the federal carbon levy by $10 a year after 2022, and a guaranteed ""livable income"" for older and out-of-work Canadians — were not included in the estimates.   To date, the Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO) has released its own costing for 23 of the Green Party's platform promises — 13 of the revenue changes and 10 of the spending proposals.   More Green promises have been vetted  In that regard, the Greens are way out in front. As of Thursday afternoon, the PBO has vetted 13 Conservatives promises, and four from the New Democratic Party. No Liberal Party pledges have been independently costed. Ditto for the Bloc Québeçois, and the People's Party of Canada.     What the PBO determined however, might make the Greens wish they never bothered. Ten of the party's price tags are rated as having ""moderate uncertainty,"" and the remaining 13 are rated as having ""high uncertainty.""  Take the party's pledge to create a new, 0.5 per cent tax on all financial transactions in Canada, for example. The Greens claim that it will raise $15.7 billion in new revenue in 2021-22 and $18.1 billion a year by 2024-25 — the single biggest tax increase they are counting on to finance their ambitious plans.   But according to the PBO, the response of the financial markets to such a tax is so unclear that the revenue estimates ""could be off by factors of 2 or 3 in either direction (higher or lower).""  Big windfall? Huge hole? Dead on? Who knows?   Outside assessment gives failing grade  Other outside assessments of the Green platform pricing are even harsher.  The Institute of Fiscal Studies and Democracy (IFSD) at the University of Ottawa has issued a ""Fiscal Credibility Assessment"" and gives the Green Party a failing grade when it comes to realistic economic assumption, responsible fiscal management, and transparency.  Kevin Page, the former parliamentary budget officer who heads the institute, says the Green Party costing is riddled with errors — for example the numbers in the detailed tables don't match the overview totals. And it all appears to be based on outdated, 2018 fiscal projections.  ""To us, it looked like it was put together in a very hurried fashion,"" says Page. ""Somebody made a mistake.""  Page gives the party credit for asking the PBO to cost out many of its ""toughest measures."" But he says that Elizabeth May's proposals on the move to a zero-carbon economy and rebalancing the tax system are so transformative that much more detail is required before they can be fairly assessed.     The Green Party has acknowledged the errors and omissions and says it is working to correct them.  Greens say revisions coming  ""We are currently undertaking a review and will present a revised version in due course,"" Rosie Emery, a party spokesperson, said in an emailed statement.   But the public shouldn't expect any more independent analysis. Emery says that the PBO has now released all of the Greens' requested costing estimates.   (It also seems likely that the Greens have used up their allotted share of the resources and money that the Parliamentary Budget Officer dedicated to studying election promises. And with a little more than three weeks to go before ballots are cast, the PBO's ""absolute deadline"" for new requests — 15 business days before the election — is looming.)  Geneviève Tellier, a University of Ottawa political scientist who studies budgetary policies and public finances, says the PBO costing — a new wrinkle for a federal election campaign — is working better than she expected; providing a level of detail about party promises and their underlying assumptions that voters have never had before.   Small parties at a disadvantage  But the new system may not be working in the Greens' favour.  ""A smaller party may be disadvantaged,"" says Tellier, noting their relative lack of in-house expertise and money. ""The bigger parties are better able to manipulate their numbers, or try to present them to their own advantage.""  In other words, honesty may be the best — but not the most politically sophisticated — policy.  The Verdict: Partially true. The Greens have shared more information about their promises than any of the other federal parties, thus far. But errors in their math, and a number of big, unpriced pledges, make their claim of complete transparency a little cloudy.

259,ANALYSIS | The Alberta (dis)advantage: Why a Liberal minority is what the province fears most,"Much of the talk among election watchers around in Alberta is about a Liberal minority, and what it would mean for the province and the oil and gas industry.   Of course, polling makes it abundantly clear that a Conservative majority is by far the preferred outcome in Alberta (and Saskatchewan) but, hey, minorities are hardly uncommon anymore, and we could well see another one after the election on Oct. 21. So what would that mean for the conservative heartland?  If it's a Liberal minority — and that is the scenario most are tossing around in the province — the general consensus seems to run along the lines of ""Alberta's Worst Nightmare,"" as a July opinion piece in the Globe and Mail declared.  More recently, a Calgary Herald column outlined ""an awful realization,"" describing the death throes the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion (TMX) would likely succumb to with a Liberal minority.    The Liberals, it's assumed, would need to work with the NDP and the Greens to survive; that would mean compromise with parties with a pipeline aversion, which in turn would mean the end of TMX and more.  People here talk about the very survival of the oil and gas industry as being in jeopardy.   That might sound alarmist, but the leap to that conclusion is easy to understand.  Tortured path  The path of the TMX has been a tortured one, and the uncertainty and volatility concerning its future could be on steroids in a minority parliament.  Green Party Leader Elizabeth May has made it abundantly clear that she won't support any minority government that continues with the construction of the TMX. She had previously said she wouldn't prop up any minority based on the current climate plans from any party, but this week, she took direct aim at the pipeline.    Before that, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh had said he wouldn't impose a pipeline on any province that says no to it. He's also said he won't work with a Conservative minority government.  So it's hard to see how a potential minority Parliament is supposed to work, with parties busy issuing ultimatums.  But why is it assumed the Liberals or the Conservatives would need to compromise with the NDP or the Greens?  Should the tails wag the dog?  Stephen Harper led two Conservative minority governments between 2006 to 2011 before finally capturing a majority.  His first was the longest minority Parliament in Canadian history. His second was, well, the second-longest.  Clearly, he found ways to work with the other parties.    The current dynamic with the Greens and the NDP would make that difficult to replicate, but why couldn't the Liberals work with the Conservatives — or vice versa — to finish building TMX?  Duane Bratt, a political scientist at Mount Royal University in Calgary, says he's a bit perplexed by the notion that two parties with a combined total of conceivably 300 seats would allow a major pipeline project to be trashed because of the opposition of roughly 10 per cent of MPs.  First, he says, there would be a recognition of the revenue implications for the federal treasury. But there would also be political calculations.  ""The two parties could cooperate on TMX — the two big parties — because if the Conservatives don't form government, does Andrew Scheer survive? If the Liberals don't form government, does Justin Trudeau survive? And I think the answer to both of those is, no, they don't,"" Bratt says.    So working together could mean survival: the most powerful of motives.  There would be other concerns for Albertans, however, if a Liberal minority came to pass.  Memories of the NEP  Bills C-48 and C-69 are major irritants for Premier Jason Kenney's UCP government. The B.C. tanker ban and the federal government's controversial overhaul of the environmental assessment process are seen as legislation targeting and impeding a struggling industry that is the backbone of the Alberta economy.  A minority (or majority) Liberal government guarantees that legislation survives.  Naturally, a Conservative majority would make it simpler and more predictable for the resource-dependent economy in Alberta.  But we don't live in simple times.  We are an increasingly polarized nation with polarized politics. There is a very real possibility that the next government might not have any representatives in Alberta and Saskatchewan, if the Liberals win.  We've seen this before. Pierre Trudeau won a majority in 1980 with goose eggs in both provinces. (They also came up empty in B.C.)    After that election, Justin Trudeau's father led the government that brought in the National Energy Program (NEP), widely seen in Alberta as a way to transfer its wealth to other parts of Canada, while exerting greater federal control over the oil and gas industry.  Sound familiar?  It's an echo that reverberates throughout the province even now, and helps inform the blowback here toward equalization, along with resentment that Alberta's wealth makes such an outsized contribution to federal coffers, largely on the back of an industry under attack and fighting for survival.  Scheer quiet on equalization  Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer doesn't sound like he's coming to the rescue.  Fixing equalization — a rallying cry from Kenney — is not part of the Scheer stump speech.  Kenney has promised a ""referendum"" on equalization in October 2021. The Alberta premier has always included an overhaul of the formula on his list of priorities, a list that also includes repealing C-48 and C-69 and building the TMX.    University of Calgary economist Trevor Tombe (who has not only written about equalization extensively, but actually does public seminars about it) was asked if Kenney was given a free hand to rewrite the formula, respecting the constitutional principles, what would he accomplish?  Tombe's reply: ""There's no way to redesign the equalization formula that would lead any dollars from it to flow to Albertans. And so changes to the formula just affect the allocation of payments made to other provinces. It'll never pay out to Alberta.""  A practical, academic view. But viewed through the political lens in this province, it represents unfairness.  The stakes for Alberta  Although a Liberal minority government doesn't guarantee Alberta's aspirations will be quashed, it does inject a high degree of uncertainty into the economic future of this province.

260,"Some mobile mechanics gearing up, while others hit the brakes","It's a busy time in Canada's emerging mobile mechanic sector.   While one big player is backing out of the industry, there are now more than two dozen mobile auto service businesses in cities across Canada, several of them operating in multiple locations.  Their offerings range from the basics like oil, fluid and tire changes to more complex work, including brakes, shocks and power steering repair.  It's a lucrative sector to get into: the auto repair industry in Canada is worth $17 billion Cdn a year and supports more than 27 000 businesses.  Mobile auto service companies have just a fraction of that revenue, but their growth is being driven by offering convenience.      ""It's one less thing you have to do in your day,"" says Cody Peskelewis, who with his partner Kristen Gayowski booked a company called Go Oil to do oil changes on two vehicles at their home in Calgary last month. ""Especially on a weekend, and there are things you have to get done, the last thing I want to do is go to a lube shop.""    The ease of booking a mechanic via smartphone to come to a customer's home or office is hidden behind a complicated business behind the scenes.        ""It's had its challenges,"" says Jonathan Sparrow, founder of Go Oil, based in Winnipeg. ""The technical aspect was a big deal to build.""   The operating software that is the backbone of his business was designed by college students, who began working on it as a co-op placement before some were hired as the business expanded.     The custom oil-vacuum system found in company vans was designed by Sparrow himself. Just 24 years old now, Sparrow started the business in 2017 and has 10 Go Oil franchises across the country.  Cross-country trend  Mobile auto repair services can now be found from Victoria to St. John's. They're trying to win over private car owners and also capture business maintaining company owned fleets.        In Calgary, more than half a dozen companies will come to customers' doors to service cars.   Ottawa has a similar number, while in Toronto there are more than 10 mobile operators.    Their rapid proliferation over the past few years should have caught the attention of auto dealerships, and chains like Mr. Lube, Midas, Jiffy Lube and Great Canadian Oil Change.    ""I always tell executives, when you're looking for disruptive innovation, don't look for one company doing something, look for a cluster of companies,"" says Darren Meister, a professor at the Ivey Business School of Western University in London, Ont.    ""It means a whole bunch of people have seen there's a potential opportunity here.""    Though auto glass replacement companies do have mobile services, the major auto service chains have so far not started up mobile divisions.    Are the big players like Mr. Lube missing out? Not yet, says Meister.   It's still too early to say just how disruptive the mobile mechanic trend will be, or which companies will win enough business to be worth investing in or trying to acquire.      Leading player Fiix sells business    One high-profile Canadian company has just hit the brakes on its business after being scooped up by a U.S. company.  Four years after opening, Toronto mobile mechanic operator Fiix has sold its business to a Seattle-based mobile auto service company called Wrench.  Fiix was founded by a group of friends in their twenties, Arif Bhanji, Khalil Mangalji and Zain Manji.      The trio raised $2.5 million Cdn in funding from Silicon Valley investors, and attracted 8,000 customers in the Toronto area, also winning contracts to service cars for Uber drivers and Car2Go, a car-sharing business.   Fiix had a team of three full-time mechanics and 10 part-time ones, and network of independent contractors. Bhanji believes the company was getting close to capturing one per cent of the area's auto repair market.        Despite the success, Fiix found itself at a fork in the road.     The team was looking for a business that could become a so-called unicorn company.   After crunching the numbers, Bhanji said they asked themselves a tough question: ""Do we think we can take this to $100 million?""   They weren't happy with the answer. ""We all came to the conclusion that it wasn't something that was easily scalable.""   Recognizing Fixx's growth rate would never be explosive, the young partners decided to pay back their investors and plan to use their experience to start a new company.       Wrench, the company that bought Fiix, isn't expanding into Toronto right now. It acquired Fiix because the company's website has very strong traffic: About 70 per cent of Fiix's online visitors are Americans, whom Wrench plans to turn into their own customers in U.S. cities.  Wrench co-founder Casey Willis says the company's ambition is to become ""the Starbucks of auto repair,"" and it is interested in the Canadian market.    Another large American player called Your Mechanic is already in Canada, with a pilot operation in Toronto.   That company has raised almost $40 million US in investment with a Canadian connection; a big chunk of that money is from RBC Ventures.    The road ahead      For now, the Canadian mobile auto service sector remains one Canadian entrepreneurs can test and develop.   It's not clear whether a model offering only simple services like oil and tires changes will prove viable, or if providing a longer list of services will be more sustainable.   Many moving into the sector see the brick-and-mortar chains as their primary competition, as opposed to other mobile players.         As soon as the electric car market takes off,  if I were in the mobile mechanic business, I would wonder what is going to be left for us to do.  - Jean-Baptiste Litrico, Smith School of Business, Queen's University     Some industry watchers believe the long-term challenge facing these innovative companies is another innovation: electric cars, which have fewer moving parts and fewer service needs.  ""As soon as the electric car market takes off,"" says Jean-Baptiste Litrico, a professor with the Smith School of Business at Queen's University, ""if I were in the mobile mechanic business, I would wonder what is going to be left for us to do.""  Sparrow is focused on a more immediate future.       It's estimated that by 2020 about 60 per cent of vehicles in Canada will be seven or more years old, and those old combustion engines need a lot of lubrication.   Last year, Canadians spent $2 billion on oil changes, and in the U.S. that number was more than $7 billion.  Go Oil wants to grow, and quickly, Sparrow says. ""Going to the end of the year, our goal is to get past 20 franchises or more."" ",business
261,Chump change or chump customers? B.C. woman steamed over Walmart's wrongful GST charge,"It's not the 18 cents in GST she was wrongly charged at the New Westminster Walmart that's got Sally Dossa steamed.   It's that after noticing the mistake and flagging it to store managers, she was told she couldn't get a refund because there was no way of overriding Walmart's centralized computer check-out system.  ""They said it comes from head office,"" said Dossa, sounding slightly exasperated. ""They had no answer for me.""  The error occurred last week when Dossa was charged GST on one of five food items she purchased at the retail chain. Under law, basic groceries are exempt from GST.  Walmart doesn't benefit financially from the tax it collects. Rather, it passes that money to the Canada Revenue Agency.  The incident got her thinking though. Because what might seem like chump change in a singular instance, is anything but when you consider Walmart's big footprint on the Canadian retail landscape.    ""If they have 2,000 customers going through that store every day and if each one is paying an extra 20 cents... it ends up being a lot of money,"" said Dossa. ""And if it's happening at this store, it's happening at all Walmart stores.""  There are 411 Walmart stores in Canada meaning a small mistake can multiply into big money.  And that's why Dossa contacted CBC. Not because of 18 pennies, but because of the principle of it all.    ""I feel it's my moral duty as a citizen to bring it to someone's attention,"" said Dossa. ""If each one of us walked away and didn't care about these things then we're all going to be paying for stuff we shouldn't be paying for.""  Walmart Canada told CBC that it has fixed the error in its system, but it didn't answer questions about how many other customers wrongly paid GST, or how long the error was in the system.  ""Tracking provincial and federal tax on millions of possible products in-store and online is complex,"" said Walmart's Felicia Fefer in an emailed response.    GST, confusing receipts and the law  The general rule in Canada is that basic grocery items are ""zero-rated"" or GST exempt under the Excise Tax Act.  Dossa bought five items at Walmart  — milk, yams, tomatoes, apples and a bag of flour — all zero-rated items.  Even though she knew she shouldn't be paying GST, she also couldn't tell from looking at the receipt which item it had been incorrectly charged to.    And that point of confusion — a receipt that doesn't clearly indicate which item is being taxed — might be the biggest problem, according to lawyer Jeff Orenstein.  Amazon class action  Earlier this year, Orenstein and his firm Consumer Law Group, successfully argued a class action against Amazon on behalf of almost 7,000 clients in the Quebec Court of Appeal.   Amazon is now appealing the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada.   In the case, Amazon was found to be charging GST on a slew of zero-rated food and medical items, collecting million of dollars in error. But that fact wasn't enough to carry the case because Canada Revenue Agency provides a remedy for customers who have wrongly paid tax.     Instead, Orenstein argued that under the Consumer Protection Act, Amazon's billing system was a misrepresentation to consumers because the company didn't indicate which items were being taxed and which weren't.    ""[Amazon's] bill didn't tell you anything,"" he said. ""It didn't tell you which items were taxable which were not taxable — it was all global GST and global PST and you need a calculator and trial and error to figure it out. And we won on that.""  Orenstein said, in his opinion, Dossa's Walmart receipt is similarly problematic.     ""I think [the Walmart receipt] would fall under the same type of idea as Amazon, where the bill itself is so confusing that it is the misrepresentation,"" said Orenstein.  Orenstein says the system is tilted against the individual.  According to the Canada Revenue Agency, a customer seeking to get their wrongly charged tax back should first ask the store for a refund or credit like Dossa did — albeit unsuccessfully.  But even then, there is no legal obligation for the store to refund the money.  System is 'crazy,' says lawyer  The only other option is to fill out a multi-page document called the GST189 General Application of Rebate of Goods and Services Tax and submit it to Revenue Canada for consideration along with your receipt.  Orenstein says the system is ""crazy.""  ""Ask 100 people on the street and you'll be lucky if one person knows that you can fill out a form and get your money back from Revenue Canada,"" he said. ""But that's the way the system is designed.""  A spokeswoman for the CRA said there is no penalty for a company that collects GST in error.  Walmart said, as per the law, the tax it wrongly collects is remitted to the proper body. ""In this case, it was passed on to the Canada Revenue Agency and did not go to Walmart,"" said Fefer.  Fefer says anyone who believes they were incorrectly charged at Walmart should bring their receipt to the store for a refund.",business
262,More woes for Boeing 737 as cracks discovered on some planes,"More bad news for Boeing's 737 line of aircraft: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said late Friday it will require operators of some 737 NG jetliners to conduct inspections for structural cracks and make repairs as needed following the discovery of cracks on a small number of planes.  The FAA said Boeing notified it of the issue ""after it discovered the cracks while conducting modifications on a heavily used aircraft."" Subsequent inspections ""uncovered similar cracks in a small number of additional planes."" Boeing said on Friday it has been in contact with 737 NG operators about a cracking issue, but added that ""no in-service issues have been reported.""  Neither the FAA nor Boeing immediately said how many planes were impacted by the required inspections.  The 737 NG, or Next Generation, was introduced in 1997 and is the third-generation version of the best-selling Boeing airplane. It includes the 737-600, -700, -800 and -900 models and is operated in Canada by WestJet and Air Transat but not Air Canada. There was no immediate indication that either airline's fleets were affected.  Its successor is the 737 MAX series, which was grounded in March after two fatal crashes in five months, but which is not affected by this issue, Boeing said.  The FAA said it would ask operators of the NG to ""report their findings to the agency immediately"" after completing inspections. Boeing said ""over the coming days, we will work closely with our customers to implement a recommended inspection plan for certain airplanes in the fleet.""  KOMO News reported on Friday the issue involved cracked ""pickle forks"" in some 737 NG jets. The pickle fork attaches the plane's fuselage, or body, to the wing structure and manages forces. A failure of the part in flight could pose a serious risk. KOMO said workers found a severely cracked pickle fork on a Boeing 737NG earlier this month.  Transport Canada had not issued an online civil aviation safety alert about the issue as of early Saturday morning. ",business
263,StatsCan hired PR firm to prevent 'reputational damage' after outcry over plan to gather banking records,"Statistics Canada was so concerned over the potential damage to its reputation following revelations the agency was requesting customer transaction data from banks, it hired a public relations firm to help ""re-establish"" control over its public image.  A document obtained by CBC News through an access to information request show the federal statistics agency was deeply troubled by the maelstrom of criticism stemming from an Oct. 26, 2018, Global News report on its pilot project seeking detailed financial records from Canadian financial institutions. Weeks later, the agency discreetly and urgently solicited outside help.    ""If the current situation is not mitigated without delay, the potential reputational damage to the agency over time could become irreversible. If this negatively-charged public discourse continues unchecked, there could be a significant reduction in the willingness of Canadians to participate in the agency's statistical operations,"" a request for proposal (RFP) document read.  The document stated that lower trust levels among Canadians could lead to lower participation rates in many of its voluntary and mandatory data collection and therefore reduce the quality of its data products.  ""In order to respond to this rapidly evolving public environment, to re-establish some level of control over the public narrative about the agency … Statistics Canada is requesting the services of a public relations contractor,"" the document said.  According to a contract disclosure made by Statistics Canada last spring, Ottawa-based PR firm Brymark Promotions Inc. was the successful bidder, with a contract value of $14,012.    In many cases, government procurement information, such as tender opportunities or RFPs, is posted publicly for companies to bid on, but in the case of this contract, Statistics Canada opted to send out direct solicitations to the companies themselves.  ""The RFP was never posted publicly and was sent directly to the suppliers [traditional competitive]. This strategy was selected as the Goods and Services Identification Number Code T004 — Public Relations Services … is exempt from the trade agreements. All rules set out by PSPC for the tendering of contracts were followed,"" Statistics Canada spokesperson Laurence Beaudoin-Corriveau told CBC News in an email. PSPC refers to Public Services and Procurement Canada.  Get ahead of 'message delivery machinery'  The agency's strategy outlined in the document involved getting ahead of what it called the ""message delivery machine"" and guiding the public narrative back to a more positive tone.  Turnaround times expected by Statistics Canada were so quick that potential bidders balked at the time-frames calling them ""unrealistic,"" according to the document obtained by CBC News. The agency responded to the supplier that ""it is the urgent nature of our pressing requirement that drive these constraints. Sentiment noted.""  Among the deliverables expected by the agency was a so-called sentiment analysis following negative press and an accounting of the key players who have been shaping the public discourse on the issue.  The project also called for the identification of third-party endorsers who could validate Statistics Canada methods and goals and influence the course of the public discourse.  CBC News reached out to Brymark Promotions for comment and public examples of the work it did for Statistics Canada. The company did not respond.  Privacy investigation continues  Under the Statistics Act, the agency can require third-party organizations to disclose information that would ""assist Statistics Canada in fulfilling its mandate."" Statistics Canada has already been collecting personal information for years, including medical records related to cancer and annual tax filings, and it is increasingly seeking new sources of reliable and timely data across the country.  More recently, the agency had also announced it would be acquiring details on the credit history of Canadians from credit reporting agency TransUnion.   Even though StatsCan has been making similar types of requests for years, the data collection project was put on hold when the privacy commissioner formally launched an investigation after its office received complaints in November 2018.  The investigation is still ongoing with no estimated end date, confirmed a spokesperson for the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada.      Bank data furor threatens ability to compile accurate data: chief statistician     Privacy commissioner launches probe into StatsCan over collection of financial data     During a Senate committee in December, the president and CEO of the Canadian Bankers Association said his organization would not exclude the possibility of taking legal action to block Statistics Canada from obtaining clients' data.  The association's spokesperson, Mathieu Larbrèche, said it had no further comment, noting the Statistics Canada's project was currently on hold.  Modernization of data collection  In an announcement in January, Anil Arora, the country's chief statistician explained that the agency's modernization efforts are both in response to a greater need for timely and accurate electronic data, but also because of concerns over questionnaire burnout and fatigue.    In addition to running pilot projects such as the aborted banking information attempt, Statistics Canada is also experimenting with new public and private sources of administrative data, crowdsourcing and using scanner data.  Statistics Canada would not directly respond to questions about the PR contract.  In an email to CBC News, Martin Magnan, manager of strategic communications and stakeholder relations for the agency, wrote:  ""In this increasingly data-centric society, we have heard Canadians' desire to want to know more about the important work we do on their behalf and how we protect their privacy and confidentiality.  That is why we have taken steps, such as the establishment of an online Trust Centre and the hiring of external advisers, to continue to find ways to enhance the way we communicate and engage with Canadians. The aim of this twofold approach is to enable Canadians to get the facts about our practices and to engage them in a dialogue on how we can improve our communications and approach.""

264,Trump heats up cooling trade war rhetoric with plan to delist Chinese companies from U.S. exchanges,"President Donald Trump's administration is considering the possibility of delisting Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges, a source briefed on the matter said on Friday, in what would be a radical escalation of trade tensions between the two countries.  The move would be part of a broader effort to limit U.S. investments into China, the source said, confirming an earlier report by Bloomberg that sent shockwaves through financial markets.  Shares of Alibaba Group Holding, JD.com, Pinduoduo, Baidu, Vipshop Holdings, Baozun and IQIYI fell between 2 per cent to 4 per cent in afternoon trading.  China's yuan currency, traded in off shore markets, fell by 0.4 per cent against the dollar after the news to trade near its weakest against the greenback in about three weeks.    Exact mechanisms for how to delist the companies were yet to be worked out and any plan is subject to approval by President Donald Trump, who has given the green light to the discussion, Bloomberg reported citing a person close to the deliberations.  Officials are also examining how the U.S. could put limits on the Chinese companies included in stock indexes managed by U.S. firms, although it was not clear how that would be done, the agency cited three sources as saying.  A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers in June introduced a bill to force Chinese companies listed on American stock exchanges to submit to regulatory oversight, including providing access to audits or face delisting.    Chinese authorities have long been reluctant to allow overseas regulators to inspect local accounting firms - including member firms of the Big Four international accounting networks — citing national security concerns.  As of February, there were 156 Chinese companies listed on the NASDAQ and New York Stock Exchanges, according to government data, including at least 11 state-owned firms.   NYSE declined to comment on Friday while Nasdaq, MSCI, S&amp;P and FTSE Russell all did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Escalation tactic  Trade talks between the United States and China are expected to resume next month after months of tit-for-tat moves by both sides which have weakened global growth and driven rollercoaster moves in markets.  ""It's all very disruptive, it just adds to uncertainty and its a big negative for business investment,"" said Scott Brown, chief economist at investment bank Raymond James. He noted, however, that both sides have tended to use aggressive moves in the past as leverage ahead of talks.  ""You never know if its a ploy to get some leverage,"" he said.    Trump on Tuesday delivered a stinging rebuke to Beijing's trade practices in a speech at the United Nations before a day later stoking hopes that the nearly 15-month standoff could be nearing an end.  ""They want to make a deal very badly... It could happen sooner than you think,"" he told reporters in New York on Wednesday.  The reports on Friday knocked around half a percent off the value of the S&amp;P 500 and reduced the value of the largest U.S. exchange-traded fund tracking Chinese stocks, the iShares China Large-Cap ETF, by more than 1.4 per cent.

265,"Scheer pledges to fold $35B federal infrastructure bank, reduce commute times","Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said today a government led by him would bring transparency back to federal infrastructure spending by scrapping the Canada Infrastructure Bank.   Speaking in Coquitlam, B.C., Scheer said the bank — announced as part of the fiscal update in 2016 and tasked with deploying $35 billion to draw private sector investment and partnerships for large infrastructure projects — has been a waste of public money.   ""I will eliminate Justin Trudeau's Canada Infrastructure Bank, a $35 billion failure that has not lived up to its promise,"" said Scheer. ""This government-knows-best boondoggle in the making was supposed to boost investment and get more projects built. But two years after it started, the infrastructure bank has completed nothing.""  The bank has so far committed $2 billion to a Go Train expansion in Ontario, $55 million to a high-speed rail project between Toronto and Quebec City, $128 million to expanding light rail in Montréal and $20 million for the Mapleton Water and Wastewater facilities in Ontario.  The agency also has signed a number of agreements for other projects and in some cases is providing advisory services for infrastructure proposals.    Scheer also announced that, if elected, he would revamp the way infrastructure projects across Canada are prioritized. Projects that reduce congestion and result in faster commute times would be pushed to the top of the queue, he said.  ""These are the kinds of projects that make a difference in people's lives by reducing gridlock and speeding up commute times,"" said Scheer.  The Conservative leader pitched the move as one that would allow families to spend more time with their loved ones and less time travelling. Examples of projects that would be approved under this police include:     The George Massey Tunnel Replacement Project in Vancouver, B.C.    The Ontario Line Yonge Subway Extension in Toronto, Ont.   The third link across the Saint Lawrence River in Quebec City.    Unlike the leaders of the Liberal, NDP and Green parties, Scheer chose not to attend any of today's climate change action protests across the country. Reporters asked him if announcing a measure to help reduce traffic congestion was tone-deaf in the circumstances.    Scheer said he's encouraged to see so many young people engaged with an issue they care about.  ""I'm here making an announcement today that will lower commute times, which means people will be stuck in traffic less, which means a reduction of emissions,"" Scheer said describing the move as ""real concrete action"" that would lower emissions.  The Liberal Party responded to the announcement by saying that the Conservatives were ""cherry-picking projects.""  ""Scheer's infrastructure proposal is nothing short of a rollback of our commitment to building stronger communities,"" the Liberal statement said. ""Conservative cuts hurt, and it is Canadian families and communities who will be affected by Scheer's five-year cuts plan.""  ",business
266,Car2Go to pull out of Calgary and 4 U.S. cities before year's end,"The vehicle-sharing service Car2Go says it's pulling out of Calgary and four U.S. cities before the end of the year.  The company announced Friday that its service would end in Calgary, Denver, and Portland, Ore., and Austin, Tex., on Oct. 31. Its service in Chicago will end on Dec. 31.  ""This decision was not made lightly,"" the company said in a statement posted Friday. ""We have had to face the hard reality that despite our efforts, we underestimated the investment and resources that are truly necessary to make our service successful in these complex transportation markets amid a quickly changing mobility landscape.""  Car2Go said that since it launched in North America in 2009, transportation has changed drastically, with options that range from ""traditional automakers to ride-hail giants to micro-mobility disrupters.""  In Calgary, which has had Car2Go since 2012 and is the only Canadian city affected, the company informed its users Friday via a email.  ""Despite our best efforts over the years encouraging the city to implement policy that better supported carshare, and amid an ongoing economic recession and an increasingly competitive marketplace, we are unable to continue operating in Calgary,"" Car2Go said.  ""We deeply regret any inconvenience this decision may cause you.""  It said the last date users would be able to start a trip in Calgary would be Oct. 31, with all trips ending no later than 11:59 p.m. MT that day.  Many benefits   The wording of Car2Go's announcement suggested that there may have been some friction with the City of Calgary over car-sharing policies.  But Eric MacNaughton, a senior transportation engineer with the city, says that it actually tried to make Calgary sustainable for Car2Go with policies such as reduced parking costs in residential permit zones.  ""We certainly see the benefit of car sharing in Calgary ... so we actually have put in place some policies that reduce costs for car share companies,"" MacNaughton said.  Car2Go's withdrawal from other North American cities, MacNaughton said, indicates that there are ""a wide range of factors"" influencing the company's decision.  However, MacNaughton says officials will be reviewing policies to attract similar services.   ""We're going to be taking a step back — looking at our policies, looking at what other car share companies are operating out there ... to make sure that we have car sharing services in the future,"" MacNaughton said.  Though MacNaughton says his understanding is that Car2Go's decision is final, the city is aware of how many benefits it provides.  ""It does reduce the costs of travel for citizens, it can reduce the number of vehicles people need to own, it helps reduce emissions from transportation,"" MacNaughton said.   ""It meets a lot of the goals that we have as a city, so we are certainly sorry to see Car2Go leaving.""  Calgary Coun. Evan Woolley tweeted Friday that he had already spoken with senior transportation staff and the city was working on ""a solution to keep this important mobility option"" in the city.    With over 100,000 Calgarians using Car2Go, Woolley says it's a big loss that he would work to replace.  ""I think if this is a final decision, we will be reaching out to other car share operators and looking at what types of other opportunities might be possible in the private sector,"" Woolley said.  The news is getting mixed reviews from Calgarians on Twitter.        Focus shifts   Car2Go users can still use their memberships in other North American locations listed on their website.  The company said it would refocus its efforts on ""the cities that present the clearest path to free-floating carshare success"" — Montreal, Vancouver, New York City, Washington D.C., and Seattle.  Car2Go stopped operations in Toronto in May 2018, blaming city hall and saying a free-floating car-sharing pilot program passed by council after months of debate was overly restrictive. Specifically, it called the parking permit fees of about $1,500 per vehicle ""unprecedented.""  ",business

268,"Boeing underestimated pilot response time, cockpit confusion in responding to 737 Max problems, report says","Federal safety officials say Boeing should consider how cockpit confusion can slow the response of pilots who are dealing with the kind of problem that likely caused two airliners to crash in the past year.  They suggest that Boeing underestimated the time it takes — measured in precious seconds — for pilots to diagnose and react when they are being bombarded by multiple, cascading warning alerts.  The National Transportation Safety Board issued several recommendations Thursday after taking part in investigations into two crashes of Boeing 737 Max jets that killed 346 people.  It will be up to investigators in Indonesia and Ethiopia to determine what caused the accidents in those countries. Preliminary reports have pointed to an anti-stall system that kicked in based on faulty sensor readings and pushed the noses of the planes down.  Boeing officials have said the pilots didn't follow known procedures for stopping a sudden nose-down pitch or, in the case of the Ethiopian crash, followed the procedures only briefly.  The safety board said Boeing assumed that pilots flying the Max would respond to an automated nose-down push by taking ""immediate and appropriate"" steps. Federal regulations allow manufacturers to make such assumptions, and Boeing even used test pilots in flight simulators to check its assumptions.  Failed to consider all possible triggers for anti-stall software  Boeing presented highly-trained test pilots only with a single alert indicating a condition known as runaway stabilizer trim, which can be triggered by the MCAS anti-stall system, safety board officials said. They said Boeing failed to consider that an underlying problem like sensor failures — which triggered MCAS in both Max crashes — would set off several alarms.  In the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes, they said, the pilots' control columns would have shaken to warn of an impending stall. They would have also gotten several visual and sound alerts about things like altitude and speed.    ""That's the actual scenario that never got evaluated in the simulator,"" said Dana Schulze, the board's director of aviation safety.  Schulze said years of research have shown that when multiple alarms compete for the attention of pilots, it can lead to a situation in which ""pilots will not respond as perhaps you might have intended.""  The safety board will recommend that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which certified the Max to fly in 2017, evaluate the effect that all possible cockpit alerts might have on pilot response. The board also recommended that FAA require Boeing to include changes in cockpit design or pilot training to help pilots follow proper procedures when responding to the Max's automated control systems.  Grounding could last into 2020  Schulze told reporters that the board wants the FAA to take those steps before it lets the Max fly again, although the board did not put a timetable in its formal recommendations.  The safety board recommended that the FAA examine whether other aircraft besides the Max might have been approved without considering how multiple alarms could distract pilots. It also said the FAA should encourage other regulators in Canada, Europe and elsewhere to do the same thing.  In a statement Thursday, the FAA said it will review the NTSB's recommendations as it continues to evaluate changes that will be made to the Max.  ""The FAA is committed to a philosophy of continuous improvement,"" the statement said.    Boeing issued a short statement saying it would work with the FAA in reviewing the recommendations.  The Max has been grounded worldwide since March, shortly after the second crash. Boeing is nearing completion of changes that will make MCAS less powerful and tie it to a second sensor measuring the plane's pitch instead of just one sensor.  Boeing expects that airlines will be able to fly the plane later this year, although many analysts think early 2020 is more likely.",business
269,U.K. tanker held in Iran leaves Bandar Abbas port ,"The British-flagged Stena Impero tanker, detained by Iran in July, has started moving and exited the Bandar Abbas port on Friday, according to Refinitiv ship-tracking data.  The Stena Impero was detained by Iran's Revolutionary Guards in the Strait of Hormuz waterway for alleged marine violations two weeks after Britain seized an Iranian tanker off the territory of Gibraltar. That vessel was released in August.  The Stena has set a new destination for Port Rashid in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, about 250 kilometres away, the tracking data showed. At normal tanker speed, it would reach within half a day.  Iran's Foreign Ministry had said on Wednesday that a lifting of the detention order had been finalized, but that an investigation into the vessel was ongoing.  The U.K. government responded to the release by accusing Tehran of trying to disrupt freedom of navigation.  U.K. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said Friday ""the Stena Impero was unlawfully seized by Iran.""  He said the seizure was ""part of a pattern of attempts to disrupt freedom of navigation"" and London is ""working with our international partners to protect shipping and uphold the international rule of law.""  The ship's owner, Stena Bulk of Sweden, later said it was not in negotiations with Iran and was not aware of any formal charges against the crew or the company.    Iran had earlier freed seven of the ship's 23 crew members.  Iran's seizure of the Stena Impero on July 19 had ratcheted up tensions in the region following attacks in May and June on other merchant vessels in Gulf waters which Washington blamed on Tehran. Iran has denied responsibility.  Relations between the United States and Iran have become more strained since Washington withdrew last year from a global pact to rein in Tehran's nuclear program and imposed sanctions on the country aimed at shutting down Iranian oil exports.",business
270,McDonald's to offer Beyond Meat burger in Ontario pilot project starting next week,"Beyond Meat may have lost Tim Hortons, but it has partnered with another popular fast-food chain in Canada: McDonald's.  The iconic burger chain announced Wednesday it will test a new plant-based burger known as the P.L.T. — plant, lettuce and tomato — in 28 McDonald's locations in southwestern Ontario starting Monday.  The patty would be made of Beyond Meat, the plant-based protein that entered the scene this year on grocery store shelves and in various fast-food chains. Canadian coffee and doughnut chain Tim Hortons launched several versions of the product earlier this summer, but has since scaled back availability from across the country to just Ontario and British Columbia.  It's not immediately clear why McDonald's has selected Canada alone to be the test market for its first plant-based sandwich for the North American market. Of the 28 locations, 18 will be in London, Ont., while the rest will be in other communities elsewhere in southwestern Ontario.    California-based Beyond Meat Inc. went public earlier this year, and it quickly became one of the fastest-rising new stocks of the year, although it has pulled back from its recent highs over concerns its growth may be unsustainable, and some criticism over how healthy the patties are.  Shares in Beyond Meat jumped 13 per cent in premarket trading on the stock market when news of the McDonald's partnership came out.  The promotion, a pilot project set to last to the end of the year, represents the burger chain's biggest push into plant-based eating. The chain previously offered a soy-based veggie burger at the turn of the century but soon halted production due to slow sales.  If successful, it could become a permanent offering at some of the chains 38,000 locations in more than 100 countries around the world.  The burger will be priced at $6.49 Cdn.  The launch also comes a few months after McDonald's fierce rival Burger King launched its own meatless burger, in partnership with Beyond Meat's biggest competitior to launch the Impossible Whopper last spring.  Beyond Meat is the core ingredient in a number of fast-food offerings, including meatballs, chicken and other forms at various other fast-food chains including A&amp;W, Subway and KFC.    McDonald's says its version won't taste the way Beyond Meat burgers at other chains and grocery stores do, because the chain says it has been ""working on its recipe"" for a while.  ""We know we're not first,"" Michaela Charette, the company's head of consumer insights, told The Canadian Press. ""We've been taking our time to get it right.""",business
271,"FTC sues owner of Match.com, Tinder, OKCupid for tricking customers into paying with fake profiles","The Federal Trade Commission is suing the company that owns dating websites Match.com, Tinder, OKCupid, PlentyOfFish and others for allegedly using notifications about phoney profiles to trick consumers into paying for a subscription.  Match.com lets people create profiles for free but they need to pay for a subscription to respond to messages. Match Group, the company that owns all the various dating services listed above, sent emails to non-subscribers telling them they had received a response on the site.  But the FTC said Wednesday that Match sent millions of emails about notices that came from accounts already flagged as likely fake.  Nearly 500,000 people between June 2016 and May 2018 subscribed to Match.com after receiving communications from fake profiles, the FTC said.  Match did, however, prevent subscribers from getting email from suspected fake accounts, the FTC says.

272,"Trudeau, Scheer offer homeowners duelling green retrofit plans","Justin Trudeau and Andrew Scheer appealed Wednesday to one of their favourite voter demographics — homeowners — by offering them duelling plans meant to help out their pocketbooks with green retrofits.  These announcements were more micro in scale in terms of their overall green plans, but did give the federal leaders a springboard to trash each other's macro climate strategies. However, the fuzzy details of their environmental policies also put them on the defensive.  Refundable tax credit  Scheer was up first, speaking in Jonquière, Que., outside the home renovation chain store Potvin &amp; Bouchard. Although the Conservatives announced their green strategy in June, the Conservative leader took the opportunity to highlight one of his platform planks — a 20 per cent refundable tax credit he said will let people save up to $3,800 on green home renovations.    And it gave Scheer an opening to slam Trudeau's green plan as a whole, saying that it was written on the corner of a napkin and that all it really reveals is that Trudeau is the ""master of improvisation.""  Scheer scoffed at Trudeau's big announcement the previous day — to push Canada to net-zero emissions by 2050. Canada has already committed to reducing its annual greenhouse gas emissions to 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030.  Scheer said Trudeau not only can't meet the 2030 targets, but now says all kinds of things about what he can do in 2050 ""with zero details.""    Unlike the Liberal policy, Scheer boasted that his party has ""a real plan to protect our environment,"" and that is ""realistic and achieveable."" Not only is it the ""most comprehensive plan ever produced by a political party"" it also has the best chance to meet the Paris Agreement targets, he said.  Asked for details on how he would reach those targets, Scheer said through investing in things like green technology, green tax credits. Asked again about the the lack of details, Scheer responded that his plan is costed, that it actually does have a lot of detail and a lot of figures — and then he bashed Trudeau again.     About 90 minutes later, and more than 4,500 km west, it was Trudeau's turn to make his pitch in Delta, B.C.  Trudeau promised interest-free loans of up to $40,000 to upgrade old furnaces, replace leaky windows or retrofit homes to make them more energy-efficient and resilient to floods and wildfires caused by climate change.  But Trudeau also took the opportunity to bash the Conservatives in general, for their environmental record, or as Trudeau sees it, lack thereof.  'Do-nothing approach'  Scheer's plan for climate change, Trudeau charged, is the same as the ""do-nothing approach"" of former prime minister Stephen Harper, that will ""do less and cost more""  Unlike the Conservative Party, he said, which refuses to admit climate change is a problem, the Liberal government  has done a lot to fight climate change, and acknowledges that more needs to be done.   Yet Trudeau, like Scheer, was forced to answer questions about how exactly the plan will exceed the 2030 targets.     Trudeau said the country is already three-quarters of the way there and that, over the next 11 years, not only will Canada meet those targets, but surpass them and be well on the way to net zero by 2050.  And how will this occur?   Trudeau offered few details but stressed that the key, in general, is innovation that will develop zero emission technologies.    However fact checks conducted by CBC News raise questions about some of the environmental aspirations of both Scheer and Trudeau.    For example, as CBC's Lucas Powers revealed, Trudeau's claim that Canada is on its way to meet the 2030 climate target are undermined by reports issued by his own government.  Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC), which regularly publishes updates on the country's progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, projected that even under a best-case scenario — one that takes into account policies already in place and those that are ""under development but have not yet been fully implemented"" — our total emissions in 2030 will only be 19 per cent below 2005 levels.  And as for Scheer's promise to meet the Paris agreement targets, the CBC's Jonathan Gatehouse reported that a recent analysis, prepared by an economist and an environmental engineer for Clean Prosperity, found that Scheer's approach would end up being more costly and less effective than current government policies.   ""Our analysis of the emissions reductions potential of the plan demonstrates that it does not have a reasonable chance of achieving Canada's 2030 target under the Paris Agreement,"" the authors wrote.",business
273,"Boeing settles first Lion Air lawsuits for at least $1.2M US each, sources say","Boeing Co. has settled the first claims stemming from the crash of a Lion Air 737 Max in Indonesia, a U.S. plaintiffs' lawyer said, and three other sources said that families of those killed will receive at least $1.2 million US apiece.  Floyd Wisner of Wisner Law Firm said he has settled 11 of his 17 claims against Boeing on behalf of families who lost their relatives when a brand-new Max crashed into the Java Sea on Oct. 29 soon after takeoff, killing all 189 aboard.  Boeing spokesman Gordon Johndroe declined comment. Boeing did not admit liability in its 11 settlements, Wisner said.  The claims are the first to be settled out of some 55 lawsuits against Boeing in U.S. federal court in Chicago and could set the bar for mediation talks by other Lion Air plaintiffs' lawyers that are scheduled through next month, three people familiar with the matter said.  Wisner said he could not disclose the amount of the settlements because of a confidentiality agreement with Boeing.  The three people familiar with the matter said families of Lion Air victims, who were nearly all from Indonesia, are set to receive at least $1.2 million each. That amount would be for a single victim without any dependents.  The people spoke on condition of anonymity because the negotiations are confidential.  Awards can vary according to victims' nationality, age, marital status, income, dependents and life expectancy. The Lion Air victims were mainly from Indonesia, where incomes and crash awards tend to be lower than in the United States.  The manufacturer is also facing nearly 100 lawsuits over an Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max crash on March 10 that killed 157 people on its way from Addis Ababa to Nairobi.  Lawsuits over both crashes highlight the role of MCAS automated software that pushed the nose of the two planes lower. They claim that design flaws allowed erroneous sensor data to set off the automated system and overwhelm pilots.  The Lion Air lawsuits are being mediated before Donald O'Connell, a retired judge of the Cook County Circuit Court in Illinois, a jurisdiction often used for air accidents situated in Chicago, where Boeing is based.  Lawyers for the Ethiopian Airlines crash are pushing for a jury trial in U.S. federal court in Chicago, demanding to know why Boeing allowed the 737 Max to go on flying after the Lion Air incident.    The planemaker has said it is sorry for the lives lost in both crashes but has stopped short of admitting any fault in how it developed the 737 Max or the software.  It has said the two crashes — like most air disasters — were caused by a chain of events, with a common link between the two Max accidents being ""erroneous activation"" of MCAS.  In the Lion Air case, families of victims who were married with one to three children could receive between $2 million and $3 million, the people said.    Wisner, an industry veteran, said he had settled lawsuits for other plane crashes that took place in Indonesia in years prior to the Lion Air 737 Max crash for around $500,000 or $600,000. He will receive one third of his Lion Air settlements in fees.  The settlements come on top of $144,500 that Boeing is paying out of a $50 million financial assistance fund it set up in July for families of victims of the two crashes.    Any settlement or jury award in the Ethiopian cases is likely to be larger than for Lion Air, the people said.  Many of the Ethiopian crash victims, who came from 35 different countries, included United Nations employees and young working adults in their twenties or thirties. There were nine U.S. citizens among the victims.  Boeing is also the target of a U.S. Department of Justice criminal investigation into the development of the 737 Max.  New safety committee  The 737 Max has been grounded worldwide following the Ethiopian crash while Boeing develops software updates and new pilot training. It has already estimated a cost of more than $8 billion from the grounding, mainly due to production setbacks and compensation it will owe airlines that have cancelled thousands of flights as they manage schedules without the fuel-efficient jetliner they had counted on.  Boeing has said it hopes the 737 Max jetliner will fly again in the United States early in the final quarter of this year.    Boeing is also expected to testify at an upcoming U.S. Senate Commerce Committee hearing on aviation safety, a spokesperson for the panel said Wednesday.  The announcement came after the company's board said Wednesday it created a new permanent safety committee to oversee development, manufacturing and operation of its aircraft and services in the aftermath of two fatal 737 MAX crashes.",business
274,"Meng Wanzhou 'tricked' by border officers at Vancouver airport, lawyer claims","Defence lawyers for Meng Wanzhou claim the Huawei executive was ""tricked"" into volunteering information about herself and her company when border officers detained her at Vancouver's airport in December 2018.  Meng's legal team accused Canadian authorities Wednesday of manipulating details and leaving out crucial facts about the 47-year-old's arrest in an attempt to make it look like Meng was taken into custody in textbook fashion.  ""Ms. Meng was tricked and she was both unlawfully and unfairly deprived of her constitutional rights,"" defence lawyer Scott Fenton told B.C. Supreme Court Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes.  ""There appears to be evidence of a strategy to recast events differently than they were.""  Fenton wrapped three days of submissions Wednesday afternoon, in which he asked Holmes to order Canada's attorney general to produce records that might bolster the defence's claims of an abuse of process.  Meng is fighting extradition to the United States, where she faces fraud charges for allegedly lying to banks about Huawei's relationship to a shadow subsidiary accused of evading sanctions against Iran.    This week marked Meng's return to the court after four months away from the spotlight.  Wearing blue slacks, a striped blouse and a green sweater draped over her shoulders, Meng followed the arguments intently from a desk alongside her counsel.  The public gallery had thinned out by day three, but a clutch of Huawei employees remained.  During the breaks, Meng walked up and down the corridors of the courtroom, holding forth to her companions as earpiece-wearing security guards fanned out around her.  Meng's actual extradition hearing is scheduled for January 2020. This week's proceedings relate to a separate but included process in which her lawyers will ultimately argue the case should be tossed because of charter rights violations.    The allegations at the heart of the hearing relate to the three hours Meng spent in custody with the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) before she was arrested and afforded the right to call a lawyer.  During that time, her lawyers say CBSA officers seized Meng's electronic devices, asked for her passwords and questioned her about Huawei's business in Iran — all without ever divulging the existence of an arrest warrant.  Meng's lawyers claim the CBSA used its extraordinary powers to gather information for the RCMP and the FBI as part of a ""covert criminal investigation.""  'In no universe of possibilities'  The Crown claims the defence is on a ""fishing"" expedition and that the CBSA officers were simply acting according to their mandate, processing Meng through customs as her entry into Canada was not a foregone conclusion.  But Fenton said that assertion is ""absurd.""  ""She was never going to be returned to Hong Kong or not allowed into Canada,"" he told Holmes.  ""In no universe of possibilities was Ms. Meng going to be turned away.""    Fenton also accused CBSA officers of attempting to conceal their actions by omitting details from the notes provided to defence.  In one case, he said, the officer who seized Meng's laptop and phones makes no mention of the fact he was provided with bags specially designed to block any outside attempts to wipe their contents.  Fenton claimed that key details about meetings between CBSA and RCMP officers were missing.  And that, while one border officer's declaration that he was on hand to screen passengers as they emerged from the plane might have been technically correct, in reality, there was only one passenger he was there to intercept.  ""If one simply read the CBSA's version of events, one would never know that those events occurred,"" Fenton said.  'Troubling' notes  The Crown is expected to make its arguments next week. Neither side has to argue the merits of the abuse of process claims at this point, but the defence has to establish that there is an ""air of reality"" to the allegations.  Fenton presented the court a narrowed list of the kinds of documents the defence is looking for, indicating that he was interested in travelling up the chain of command within the RCMP for documents relating to the arrest.  He said Meng's legal team is also hoping for more information from an assistant to the vice-president of the CBSA whose ""troubling"" notes have already revealed concerns within the agency about public perception.    ""For outsidersu002Flawyers looks like may have been collusion, even if not,"" one of the notes read.  A lawyer for the attorney general told the judge that despite defence attempts to narrow their demand for documents, the Crown was likely to argue it had already provided all the information it can.  Next week's hearing is expected to last for five days.",business
275,U.S. and Japan agree to basic framework of trade deal,"U.S. President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced initial details of an emerging trade deal between the two countries on Wednesday, with Trump saying it would open up Japanese markets to $7 billion worth of American products.  U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said after a signing ceremony between the two leaders on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly that cars — the biggest source of the $67 billion U.S. trade deficit with Japan — were not covered in the announcement. He said Japan wanted further discussions on this issue.  Lighthizer said it was not the U.S. intention to impose so-called Section 232 national security tariffs on Japan and the two sides would work together in good faith, aiming to start talks on phase two of an agreement next April.  Trump said at the signing ceremony with Abe that the deal's first phase would cover $40 billion worth of digital trade between the world's largest and third-largest economies. Negotiators for the two sides will continue talks, Trump added.  The two leaders did not mention Trump's previous threats to impose U.S. tariffs on Japanese autos.    The talks hit a last-minute snag earlier this week as Japan had sought last-minute assurances that Trump would not impose Section 232 tariffs on Japanese cars and parts while negotiations continue.  The U.S. Trade Representative's office characterized the agreement signed by Trump and Abe as ""early achievements"" from their negotiations on market access for agriculture, industrial goods and digital trade.  ""Under the market access agreement we're announcing today, Japan will open new markets to approximately $7 billion in American agricultural products. Japanese tariffs will now be significantly lower or eliminated entirely for U.S. beef, pork, wheat, cheese, corn, wine and so much more,"" Trump said at the ceremony.  The USTR said about 90 per cent of U.S. food and agricultural products will receive duty-free or reduced-tariff access to Japan, but wheat will still be subject to a quota limiting the volume of U.S. imports. However, many of the products gaining new access will still face tariffs that phase out over several years.  Japan will see reduced or eliminated tariffs on a small amount of agricultural goods, including cut flowers and soy sauce, and a wide range of industrial goods, including machine tools, steam turbines, bicycles and musical instruments.  The digital trade agreement largely follows the U.S. model of internet development, prohibiting taxes on cross-border digital downloads as well as rules requiring data localization — storing data on devices physically present within a country's borders — including for financial services, USTR said.  The two countries said they intend to conclude their trade consultations within about four months and to refrain from actions ""against the spirit"" of an initial agreement, a joint statement released by Japan said.  The statement did not specifically mention the threat of U.S. tariffs on Japanese cars, but it used language similar an agreement a year ago between Trump and Abe not to impose punitive tariffs while negotiations continued.  ""While faithfully implementing these agreements, both nations will refrain from taking measures against the spirit of these agreements and this joint statement,"" the countries said. ""In addition, both nations will make efforts for an early solution to other tariff related issues.""",business
276,"Workers, car owners, dealers and GM feel pinch from strike","As the United Auto Workers' strike against General Motors stretches into a second week, it's not just the company and striking workers getting pinched.  With many replacement part warehouses shut down, dealers are beginning to run short of components to repair cars, trucks and SUVs. And companies that make auto parts are also starting to see work slowdown. Dealer inventory of new vehicles is holding up but starting to get depleted on a few models.  Meanwhile, GM is losing millions of dollars and has been forced to close one Canadian factory and send workers home at another. The 49,000 striking workers are going to have to get by on $250 per week in strike pay.  This doesn't even include the restaurants and other businesses around the more than 30 U.S. factories that have been closed due to the strike. And the longer the strike lasts, the worse it will get for everyone.  Talks went late into the night Tuesday and were resuming Wednesday with progress reported, UAW spokesperson Brian Rothenberg said.  Here's a look at the ripple effects of the strike as bargaining continues:  Auto parts  The biggest impact so far seems to be the lack of availability of some replacement parts for GM vehicles. The strike has shut down a parts depot in Charlotte, North Carolina, where the Southeast region normally gets its replacements, said Ed Williamson, who owns several GM dealers in the Miami area.  Parts suppliers, especially smaller ones where GM is the main customer, are also starting to get hit, says Morningstar analyst David Whiston. Even bigger ones like Magna International, a Canadian company that makes components for many GM models, is reporting temporary layoffs at some of its U.S. and Canadian operations.  GM spokesman Jim Cain acknowledged there are some parts shortages, but says it is still shipping parts from depots staffed by management, dealers that stockpile parts for sale to other dealers, and directly from suppliers who make high-volume parts. Cain said if recall or warranty repair parts aren't available, dealers will offer loaner vehicles.  ""Obviously it's a difficult situation, and we are working to find other sources of parts around the country,"" he said.  Dealer inventory  GM had a hefty 77-day supply of vehicles at the end of August, but big SUVs were only at about 55 days, lower than the industry average of 61. With no shipments since Sept. 16, supplies are starting to drop.  Michelle Krebs, executive analyst for Autotrader, said dealers have told her that they'll have ample supply for another week or so. Sales in September thus far have been slowing from August levels, so supplies aren't being depleted that quickly, she said.  Williamson said he's still got plenty of vehicles, including 80 to 90 days worth of big SUVs such as the Cadillac Escalade and GMC Yukon. But he's running short of the Cadillac XT5 midsize SUV.  Canadian impact  Citi analyst Itay Michalei estimates GM is losing $100 million in profits per day. The strike has already caused GM to lay off 1,850 workers and shut down its assembly plant in Oshawa, Ontario.    Another 730 were laid off from an engine plant in St. Catherine's, Ontario, according Unifor, the Canadian auto workers union.  Thus far, GM says no Mexican plants have been shut down, nor has a factory in Ontario that builds the Chevrolet Equinox compact SUV.  UAW workers  Striking workers received their last GM paycheck this past Friday and now will have to rely on $250 per week in union strike pay that starts this Friday.    When they're on the job, most workers get about $30 per hour in wages, or roughly $1,200 per week.  Whiston estimates that the work stoppage will cost the UAW's roughly $750 million strike fund about $31.5 million per week in strike pay and health care costs.",business
277,Convoy of more than 100 logging trucks arrives in Vancouver to protest forestry job losses,"More than 200 empty logging trucks from across B.C. rolled into Vancouver on Wednesday to protest job losses in the forestry industry.  The convoy was formed by drivers from communities suffering financial hardship, including Burns Lake, Fort St. James, Fort St. John, Mackenzie and Merritt.  The trucks arrived in Vancouver around 2 p.m. PT, with most congregating near the Pacific National Exhibition.  Some of the trucks drove past the Vancouver Convention Centre downtown, where municipal and provincial leaders are gathered for the Union of B.C. Municipalities convention, to send a message to government officials.  According to Todd Chamberlain, general manager of the Interior Logging Association, 120 trucks were already on the road by 7:30 a.m. Wednesday.  ""It's been very tough in some communities,"" said Chamberlain, in a phone interview on CBC's Daybreak Kamloops. ""There is no end in sight.""    Howard McKimmon, an independent trucking contractor from Merritt who organized the rally, said he hopes it will make government officials aware of how many people are currently affected by the struggling forestry industry.   Thousands of workers have been laid off and at least 22 mills in the Interior have closed or curtailed operations this year due to a combination of forces, including the end of the mountain pine beetle harvest, wildfire devastation, high log costs and low prices due to a slumping U.S. market.  Earlier this month, the province announced $69 million in aid to beleaguered workers and called on the federal government to do more.  McKimmon said that money just doesn't cut it. He estimated it amounts to less than $12,000 per worker, many of whom have been out of work for four to six months. McKimmon said he can no longer make the payments on the logging trucks he owns.    ""It's devastating,"" he told CBC's Daybreak North. ""I've made my life in the forest industry, raised kids and grandkids in this industry … I don't know what the future looks like.""  According to Chamberlain, the truckers are not asking for direct financial support from the provincial and federal government, but incentives that include a carbon tax exemption for the forestry industry.  ""We asked to be at the table and we want to be part of the solution,"" said Chamberlain.    The RCMP is expected to escort the truckers from Merritt on Wednesday morning. The RCMP will then hand off to the Vancouver Police Department when the trucks reach the city.   In a statement, VPD said people should expect congestion along the Hastings Street and Cordova Street corridors in and out of the city Wednesday afternoon.  ",business
278,CEO of eBay steps down as company seeks to sell assets,"Devin Wenig, the CEO of eBay, stepped down over differences with the company's board of directors.  ""In the past few weeks it became clear that I was not on the same page as my new board,"" Wenig tweeted Wednesday, without elaborating on the disagreements. ""Whenever that happens, its best for everyone to turn that page over.""    Ebay said there wasn't one factor leading to the change in leadership.  ""Both Devin and the Board believe that a new CEO is best for the company at this time,"" eBay said in a prepared statement.  Ebay, which is facing increasing competition from Amazon and other online stores, has been pressured by activist investor Elliott Management to sell off some of its sites.  Possible StubHub sale  In March, eBay said it might sell its ticket-reselling site StubHub and its classified ads business to focus on its main online sales site. It also added two new directors to its board chosen by Elliott.  When it was launched more than two decades ago, eBay dominated the online marketplace, giving anyone the chance to sell goods over the internet.  Today, it's competing against, among others, Amazon.com, which posted revenue last year of more than $230 billion US. In 2018, eBay had annual revenues of $10.7 billion.    Amazon has said that 58 per cent of the products sold on its site last year came from third-party sellers, the type of businesses that eBay relies on for its sales. Amazon was sued by eBay this year after accusing the company of having employees attempt to poach sellers from its site.  Wenig also stepped down as director of the board Wednesday. The company said that Chief Financial Officer Scott Schenkel will become the interim chief executive as it seeks a permanent replacement for Wenig, who has been CEO since 2015.  Shares of eBay Inc., which are up 20 per cent in the past year, slipped 1.8 per cent.",business
279,Conservatives highlight home renovation credit as part of climate plan,"Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer is highlighting his promise to give Canadians a tax credit to help make their homes more environmentally friendly.  The 20 per cent refundable tax credit could be claimed by anyone who spends between $1,000 and $20,000 on energy-saving home renovations.  That would include installing high-quality insulation, high-efficiency furnaces, replacing doors and windows, installing solar panels and upgrading ventilation, heating and cooling systems in an effort to cut energy use.  The Conservatives say the measure would allow Canadians to save up to $3,800 on renovations every year.  ""Together, the measures in our environmental plan will allow you to save while protecting our environment,"" Scheer said Wednesday at a campaign stop in Jonquiere, Que.  A report from the parliamentary budget office estimated the proposed measure would cost the federal government a total of $1.8 billion until 2021-22.  The Conservatives had previously estimated the cost to be about $900 million.  The Conservatives previously announced the two-year program in June as part of their overall plan for the environment, which also includes repealing the federal carbon-pricing regime.  Scheer has said he would stick with the current national target of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions by 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030, but his plan for the environment did not include any analysis of how its measures would achieve that goal.  The current national targets would require Canada to cut its greenhouse-gas emissions to 513 million tonnes.  Scheer said Wednesday the Green Homes Tax Credit would reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by 9 million tonnes.      Scheer was asked Wednesday whether the proposed tax credit, given it would cost $1.8 billion, is the most efficient way to reduce emissions.  Scheer said cutting down on emissions by helping Canadians to use less energy is only one part of the announcement.  ""The other key part of that is helping make life more affordable for Canadians,"" Scheer said. ""And when Canadians can take advantage of this homes tax credit to make renovations in their home, their own lives will become more affordable as the cost of living is reduced, because their energy consumption will go down.""  The Conservatives say that in 2017, buildings accounted for 85 million tonnes, or 12 per cent, of Canada's greenhouse gas emissions.",business
280,Number of doctors per capita in Canada reaches record high,"The number of doctors in Canada is growing at a rate more than double that of the population, says a report by the Canadian Institute of Health Information.  Canada's population increased by 4.6 per cent between 2014 and 2018, while the number of physicians grew by 12.5 per cent over the same time period, says the report released Thursday.  In 2018, there were almost 90,000 physicians in the country — the highest number per capita ever, the institute said.  Manitoba and British Columbia registered the largest increases in doctors at more than 17 per cent each while Quebec had the lowest level of physician growth at 5.9 per cent, just below the 6.5 per cent growth in Nova Scotia.  While the supply of doctors has grown faster than the population over the past dozen years, many Canadians continue to report difficulties finding a family physician, said Geoff Ballinger, the institute's physician information manager.  ""The big question is why does there seem to be this disconnect between the growing numbers of physicians and the fact that around the same proportion of Canadians are still having a challenge accessing physicians,"" he said in a telephone interview from Ottawa.  The Canadian Institute of Health Information is an independent, not-for-profit organization that works with governments and stakeholders to gather and provide information on policy, management, care and research.  The report found that in 2018 there was equivalent to 241 physicians per 100,000 population, the highest number per capita ever, said Ballinger.  Statistics Canada figures from 2016 show 15.8 per cent of Canadians aged 12 and older, or about 4.8 million people, reported they didn't have a regular health care provider.    The figures show Quebec, at 25.6 per cent, had the highest proportion of residents who were without a regular doctor, followed by Saskatchewan at 18.7 per cent and Alberta at 18 per cent.  Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau made an election promise earlier this week to ensure all Canadians have access to a family doctor.  Ballinger said the higher figures were encouraging for patients looking for a regular physician.    ""The issue that we don't have a handle on yet is whether those increased numbers of physicians are perhaps in parts of the province where the greatest need is,"" he said. ""We are seeing across the country that patients do have an issue trying to get access to a physician, particularly patients more in rural and remote areas.""  The report also reveals a changing demographic trend among the physician population, citing more female doctors in Canada than ever before.  Since 2014, the number of female doctors increased by 21 per cent, while male doctors rose seven per cent, Ballinger said.  The report tracked doctor incomes and found total gross clinical payments through medical plans was $27.4 billion in 2017-2018, an increase of 3.9 per cent over the previous year, Ballinger said.  It concludes average annual gross clinical payment for a doctor in Canada was $345,000, ranging from $267,000 in Nova Scotia to $385,000 in Alberta.",health
281,More ranitidine heartburn products being recalled,"More lots of heartburn medication are under recall because they may have been manufactured with an ingredient that contains too much of an impurity, Health Canada said.  Four companies, Apotex Inc., Pro Doc Ltée, Sanis Health Inc. and Sivem Pharmaceuticals, are recalling ranitidine drugs. It is commonly known by the brand name Zantac.  Over-the-counter ranitidine is approved to prevent and relieve heartburn associated with acid indigestion and sour stomach. The prescription versions are used to reduce stomach acid to prevent and treat conditions, such as heartburn and ulcers of the stomach and intestines, as well as gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD, Health Canada said.   Last week, regulators in Canada, the United States and Europe reported the presence of an impurity called N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), in low levels in ranitidine products.    NDMA is classified as a probable human carcinogen, meaning long-term exposure to levels above what is considered safe could increase the risk of cancer.   The recalled lots contain NDMA above accepted levels, Health Canada said.   Health Canada said it will update its list of affected products as needed.   The recall applies at the retail level, Apotex said in a release, meaning the products will be pulled off store shelves.  In addition to the companies' recalls, Health Canada said it has asked the companies to stop distributing ranitidine drugs in Canada temporarily while it assesses NDMA.  Last year, NDMA was one of the impurities found in blood pressure and heart failure medicines called Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers.",health
282,Privacy review finds personal information protections lacking at B.C. medical clinics ,"Medical clinics throughout British Columbia need to do more to protect the often highly sensitive personal information in their possession, according to a new report from the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner.  The OIPC report, looking at how nearly 2 dozen B.C. medical clinics are meeting their legal obligations under the Personal Information Protection Act, found that privacy protections are lacking.  OIPC auditors examined 22 clinics and found gaps in privacy management programs at several clinics, including the absence of a designated privacy officer, a lack of funding and resources for privacy and a failure to ensure that privacy practices keep up with technological advances.  Privacy Commissioner Michael McEvoy said the report raises concerns about patient privacy that are relevant throughout the province.  ""Medical clinics were chosen for this review for two reasons: the amount and sensitivity of the personal information they collect, some of the most sensitive personal information out there,"" McEvoy said.  ""Doctors and staff at clinics not only owe it to their patients to do their utmost to build and maintain strong privacy programs, but they are also legally obligated to abide by privacy legislation.""  Report recommendations  The report makes several recommendations including that clinics build robust privacy management programs that consider how personal information inventories and privacy policies are created, ensure adequate funding and resources for effective privacy management programs and that each clinic designates a privacy officer and establishes and communicates clear internal reporting structures on privacy issues.  The Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner provides independent oversight and enforcement of British Columbia's access and privacy laws.  ",health
283,Toddler making healthy recovery from throat reconstruction after swallowing teddy bear eye,"A two-year-old from Regina is learning how to swallow again following throat surgery.   Hailey Wudwud gets nutrients and medication from a feeding tube, but is is now able to eat solid food for the first time in months.   Wudwud had her throat reconstructed on Sept. 5 at Saskatoon's Royal University Hospital.  She was in the operating room for more than 10 hours and needed a blood transfusion.   ""It is so nerve wracking and really humbling,"" said Wudwud's father, Lance Payne. ""It really puts a lot of things into perspective for you.""    Wudwud is expected to make a full recovery, but a few months ago, her parents were scared she wouldn't make it to her third birthday.   Hailey began having difficulty breathing, sleeping and eating last summer.     Payne said doctors were puzzled. After tests, scans and X-rays, they eventually found out she had choked on the plastic eye of a stuffed animal.     It was there so long it became embedded in her flesh and cut a hole in her airway. It took two surgeries to remove and Wudwud's throat started to collapse.   ""We never believed that this would happen,"" said Payne. ""I'd never feared a stuffed animal would do anything like this. It's just not something that you pay attention to.   ""I wish that was different, but unfortunately I just trusted the toys.""  The doctors used about one third of Wudwud's stomach to create a new throat, leaving her stomach much smaller in size.   She often becomes ill and vomits after eating because she doesn't know how much food her stomach — which is stretching back out — can handle.     Her parents said she still requires constant attention because the valves in her throat don't always close properly so she can't have liquids or mushy foods, like pudding.  Payne said it's difficult because her siblings always want to share whatever they are eating and drinking. Being able to eat real food again has been exciting for the little girl.   ""She got to try Cheerios and some fruit and she was pretty ecstatic about it,"" said Payne. ""She was just shaking the whole time; it was really awesome for her.""  Wudwud's doctors did a contrast test with an X-ray to determine that there are no holes in her throat. Her progress with swallowing will be reassessed in a couple months.   ""Since this procedure started when she was so young, and she hasn't had to swallow in such a long time, those muscles have actually relaxed. Same as any muscle we don't use, it just starts to soften,"" said Payne.   The family is optimistic she is getting close to making a full recovery.     Payne said they are looking forward to eating Thanksgiving dinner together, with Wudwud at the table and enjoying the meal. And since she had a surgery on her second birthday, he said he wants to spoil her at Christmas.   He said Wudwud's five brothers and sisters consider her to be a super hero.   ""This has brought us together so much more than I think anything else could have. I'd rather it was something else. She is just so precious now you just look at her differently.""  The family has set up a GoFundMe to help cover the costs of their trips to Saskatoon for Wudwud's treatments. Payne said the entire ordeal has cost them upwards of $20,000.",health
284,New Brunswick is losing its only pediatric ophthalmologist,"New Brunswick's only pediatric ophthalmologist, Dr. Erica Doucet, is closing her practice in November, leaving the parents of patients uncertain about their next step in getting treatment for their children.  Doucet, who is based in Moncton, sent a letter to families that reads in part, ""unfortunately, the resources required to effectively manage the increasing number of patients do not exist at this time in New Brunswick.""  Doucet declined to do an interview with CBC News.   Melissa Berge is the mother of four-month-old, Rosalie. When Rosalie was eight weeks old she was diagnosed with congenital nystagmus. She has been waiting for an appointment with Doucet since then.     ""It causes her eyes to go back and forth,"" Berge said of the condition.  ""It affects depth perception and how far she can see, and it usually is accompanied by other visual impairments but we haven't made it that far yet.""  Rosalie was supposed to see Doucet on Friday, but the appointment was cancelled last week because the office is closing.   ""I'm disappointed we can't do it locally, but I'm really, I just wanted to have the best care,"" Berge said. ""I had heard so many wonderful things about Dr. Doucet.""  And she said it's frustrating to start fresh. The next nearest specialist to Rosalie is in Nova Scotia.    Berge has been told Rosalie will be sent to the IWK Children's hospital in Halifax. But she doesn't have an appointment yet, and Berge is worried her daughter will be put back at the bottom of the list.   ""Rosalie seems to be meeting her milestones but at one point she might not be in. You know, we don't know what she can see and how to help her.""  ""It would be nice to know what we're dealing with just for the sake of her development.""   As the mother of four children, Melissa doesn't look forward to the long drive to Halifax, which she expects will happen about three times a year.  Vitalité Health Network said that it doesn't know how many patients Doucet was treating, or how long her wait list was, but that it is actively looking for a replacement pediatric ophthalmologist.   Waiting game  Bouctouche mother Jessica Leblanc said that after a year of waiting, her daughter Anabelle didn't even manage to get an appointment with Doucet.  ""I feel like we're failing her, we're all failing her.""    Six-year-old Anabelle wears glasses and an eye patch to correct the deviation in her left eye. Leblanc said that before her specialist referral, she was told if Annabelle's eye isn't straightened out by the time her daughter is seven, it may never happen. Her birthday is in June.  ""As a mother I want to give my children everything that they need and right now she needs her eyes fixed and I can't give her that.""     Leblanc found out on social media that the province's specialist was leaving, and she's frustrated her daughter will be put back on the bottom of another doctor's waiting list.   ""It's a priority list so when she'll be seen, I have no idea. It's another waiting game.""  Other options  The Vitalité Health Authority said patients who were seeing Doucet can be seen by general ophthalmologists working in the province, or they will need to travel to Nova Scotia or Quebec.   ""If there is a specific task they cannot complete, the transfer corridor to tertiary care (IWK and Quebec) is always available to patients,""  wrote Thomas Lizotte, regional media relations adviser.",health
285,"MacArthur Foundation rewards anti-cyberharassment, other scholars","Female academics whose expertise and influence in areas as diverse as the impact of slavery on modern America, legislating against cyberharassment, and global warming and its effect on rising sea levels were named Wednesday as three of this year's 26 MacArthur fellows and recipients of genius grants.  Every year since 1981, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation has lauded academics who have shown exceptional creativity, made significant accomplishments, and have the potential for future creativity. This year's fellows will each receive $625,000 over five years.  Potential fellows are brought to the Chicago-based foundation's attention by an anonymous pool of nominators.  University of Wisconsin-Madison geochemist and paleoclimatologist Andrea Dutton told The Associated Press that she was stunned when she learned earlier this month that she had been selected.  The fellows are allowed to tell only one person before their names are officially announced. Dutton said she chose to tell a colleague who has been supportive of her career.    ""I didn't tell my parents because I thought they couldn't keep the secret,"" she said.  Dutton, 46, was nominated because of her studies on how higher temperatures lead to rising sea levels and polar ice shrinkage. As a field geologist, she has travelled the world to develop a picture of what happened during past warming periods so she can better predict the future magnitude and speed of rising sea levels as temperatures increase.  Small temperature changes, large impacts  Sea levels can rise by 20 feet (6 metres) or more when the average temperature increases by just a few degrees, she said.  ""The message is, what sounds like small changes in temperature has a very large impact on polar ice sheets,"" she said. ""That is a sobering message when it comes to climate change. It means we may have already have committed ourselves to a 20-foot increase in sea level rise.""    Dutton hasn't yet decided how to use her MacArthur grant, but suggested she could pay it forward, perhaps by helping other women in science or giving a platform to voices from underrepresented groups who could offer new insight into the impact of global warming.  Another recipient, Columbia University literary scholar and historian Saidiya Hartman, has been tracing the effects of slavery on modern America. Her studies have brought attention to lives obscured by or excluded from historical narratives, including female captives on slave ships and the inhabitants of slums in the 20th century.    Hartman's first book, Scenes of Subjection: Terror, Slavery, and Self-Making in Nineteenth-Century America, examines pre- and post-emancipation eras in the United States, and her second, Lose Your Mother: A Journey Along the Atlantic Slave Route, among other things questions the use of historical archives as the only credible source of information about the past.  Her most recent published work, Wayward Lives, Beautiful Experiments, deals with the lives of southern black women who fled to the North early in the twentieth century and their efforts to find kinship and freedom.    Hartman, 58, said the grant is a huge recognition that means she will be able to continue in her work.  Punked by friend?  ""It takes a lot of work to reconstruct those lives,"" she said, adding that a sabbatical may be in her future. ""Before I got the call, I was thinking ... 'How am I going to do the research for the next book?' It came at an opportune time.""  Danielle Citron, a professor of law at Boston University Law School and an expert in online harassment, initially didn't take her call from the foundation seriously.  ""I thought it was one of my friends trying to punk me,"" Citron said, adding that she began to believe as the caller went into details about her award.    For the past 15 years, Citron, 50, has focused her attention on cyberharassment and the toll it takes on its victims. She has advised state attorneys general and legislators on how to combat the most extreme forms of cyber abuse, including cyberstalking, cyber mob attacks and revenge porn — the nonconsensual posting of intimate photos or videos. She has worked with technology companies to update safety and privacy policies.  She told the AP that attitudes have evolved; over 10 years the number of states with laws attacking the issue of cyberstalking has grown from four to 46.  ""When they go to police, victims are no longer being told, 'Too bad, so sad,""' she said.  Citron said some cyber abusers try to control and damage their victims by invading their privacy, secretly recording them in their bedrooms or public bathrooms then using those images to coerce their victims into sharing nude photographs and filming sex acts.  Sexual privacy is essential to human dignity and intimacy and should be protected, she said.",health
286,"Juul names new CEO, suspends all advertising in U.S. — but no change in Canada","Juul's CEO has abruptly stepped down, and the company will suspend all broadcast, print and digital product advertising in the United States as a crackdown on the vaping industry it dominates intensifies.  The departure of Juul co-founder and CEO Kevin Burns is effective immediately, and the company will halt all digital, print and broadcast advertising in the U.S. as of now, the San Francisco-based company said in a news release Wednesday. But the company is making no such changes in Canada, or anywhere else.  The firm has named veteran tobacco industry executive K.C. Crosthwaite to take over from Burns.  ""Juul Labs is a global company, and this announcement impacts the U.S. only,"" a spokesperson for the company told CBC News on Wednesday.  The company advertises in Canada through various means, and has employed lobbyists to meet with politicians to try to influence policy numerous times in the past year, according to the federal registry of officially recognized lobbyists.    The company did not immediately reply to a request for comment from CBC News as to why it saw fit to change the way it does business in the U.S., but not in Canada. The company did say, however, that it complies with all ""Canadian regulations, and the company is intentionally conservative in its flavour selection, expansion and naming, to avoid the risk of youth appeal.""  ""Juul Labs Canada never has and never will market to young people,"" the spokesperson said. ""We have never engaged in lifestyle marketing, which is already banned in Canada, and have voluntarily committed to never engage in social media advertising in Canada.""  New CEO  Crosthwaite has spent much of his career at Altria, the tobacco giant that owns brands like Marlboro and Virginia Slims, and also owns about one third of Juul after a $13 billion US deal last year.  The company has been under fire in recent months after a spate of lung-related illnesses among people who vape. Juul products account for about three-quarters of all sales in the fast-growing industry.  Originally designed to be a product to help smokers wean themselves off tobacco, vaping and the industry have been criticized for seemingly getting an entirely new generation of people to start consuming tobacco — especially young people.  The company became a hit largely because its tobacco pods had a higher nicotine content than other comparable products, and in the U.S. market the company offers a wider variety of fruit and dessert flavours. In Canada, its product selection is limited but it still offer mint, mango and vanilla flavoured tobacco pods.  According to U.S. government estimates, roughly one in four American teenagers has used some sort of e-cigarette in the previous month. The Food and Drug Administration has warned Juul to stop using deceptive advertising claims in its marketing, a message that seems to have resonated with the company, as it also announced Wednesday it will suspend all broadcast, print and digital product advertising in the U.S., and will stop lobbying the government to implement legislative policies that benefit it.     U.S. officials call teen vaping 'epidemic'    The outgoing CEO, Burns, made headlines in recent weeks in a stunning TV interview in which he bluntly admitted that non-smokers should not be using his company's product.  Wednesday's moves seem designed to show the company is making an abrupt change in its corporate direction.    In a news release, Crosthwaite said: ""I have long believed in a future where adult smokers overwhelmingly choose alternative products like Juul,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, today that future is at risk due to unacceptable levels of youth usage and eroding public confidence in our industry.  ""Against that backdrop, we must strive to work with regulators, policy-makers and other stakeholders, and earn the trust of the societies in which we operate.""  Appealing for youth  David Hammond, a public health professor at the University of Waterloo who studies vaping, says that the industry began as one with the potential to be a helpful tool in getting people to stop consuming tobacco, but has become something else.  And one quarter of all U.S. teenagers using e-cigarette despite it being illegal to do so means there is a problem, he says. ""You've got to stop advertising these products in places that reach kids. So in Ontario, you literally have posters and product displays on top of the chips and chocolate bars.""  Dr. Nicholas Chadi, a pediatrician at CHU Sainte-Justine in Montreal and addiction medicine specialist, says that part of the problem with e-cigarettes such as Juul is how they are subtly made in a way to appeal to young people.  In its statement to CBC News, Juul said that it ""never has and never will"" market itself to young people, but Chadi says everything about it seems targeted to young people.   ""They come in all sorts of cool flavours and shapes, and they're high tech and you can charge them in any USB port,"" he said. ""So just the device itself is attractive to a young person, and they are discreet. They are fairly affordable.""  ""It's access. It's how these devices are made and marketed,"" he said. ""It's kind of a perfect storm for these devices to be used or misused by young people.""",health
287,"More help needed for kids with disabilities who age out of care system, parents say","For most adults, their 21st birthday is an exciting time marking another step toward independence.  However, for Deane Daprato, the son of Mark Daprato and Ijeoma Ross, turning 21 in June meant he became completely dependent on their care 24u002F7.   Mark Daprato lists some of their parental duties as including ""Bathing, toileting him and feeding him,"" before adding jovially, ""Oh, and being goofy with him and having lots of fun.""   Deane Daprato has spastic quadriplegia, a form of cerebral palsy, meaning he requires help with pretty much all his basic needs. For example, he needs to be fed through a tube.   ""And he's not in a motorized chair so if he needs to get from A to B he needs somebody to [push] him,"" said Ross, who shoulders a lot of this daily responsibility as she has the more flexible work schedule of the two parents.     ""I've got the most understanding boss in the world,"" she explained.    Growing up, Deane used to have a whole team of support around him, including speech therapists, physiotherapists, special needs educators and other social supports.   But at 21, people like Deane ""age out"" of this system and after they leave high school, opportunities to further their social development dry up.  ""It's like we dropped off a cliff,"" Mark told CBC News in a conversation about what they see as a gap in governmental support for adults with developmental disabilities.   Decades ago, people like Deane would often be institutionalized, but these ""hospital schools,"" as they were called, closed in the early 2000s when the shift to at-home support was implemented.   These days, families can apply for funding for their adult children through Developmental Services Ontario and the Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP), which can help pay for support workers and respite care.     But with long wait lists and the baseline funding being just $5,000 a year, the Dapratos say the current care model hasn't kept up with the need or the demand.   ""We've never felt more alone in this journey,"" said Daprato.     And they're among the lucky families who can afford to pay out-of-pocket for additional support.  ""What about a single parent working two jobs because that's the situation they're in? I don't know how they can possibly get through this,"" Daprato told CBC News.   Adult day programs scarce, underfunded   Twice a week, Deane attends an adult day program at Steer Friends, which operates out of a church in Markham.   ""We provide a life after high school,"" said program coordinator Jacqueline Hall-Fusco.     They do that by providing their 10 to 15 students with physical, music and pet therapy to continue their social development and by getting them out in the community so they can interact with people, which ""is huge,"" Hall-Fusco said.   Her family started Steer Friends two years after her sister Stephanie graduated high school at 21 and, like Deane, was stuck in the house at risk of regressing.  ""it's a broken system,"" she said, and like the Dapratos, she would like the Ontario government to have another look at the care model.   Since Steer Friends is largely funded through donations and her family's pocket, she'd like to see support in the form of provincial funding.     When asked whether the Ministry of Children, Community and Social Services would consider having another look at the support model, a spokesperson for Minister Todd Smith said in a statement, ""Our government is focused on delivering on our key commitments to the people of Ontario.""   ""We are constantly reviewing government programs, with a focus on improved delivery and better outcomes for all,"" Christine Wood wrote.  Mark Daprato isn't giving up on the system he feels gave up on his son. He's hopeful for reform.   ""What we know is that there's a massive inefficiency. Let's get that addressed. Let's get the needs of the parents addressed.""",health
288,"Nova Scotian with ALS getting medically assisted death, donating organs","From a hospital bed set up in his kitchen in his Lunenburg, N.S., home, 71-year-old Dr. Brian Davis is excited about his future, even though it includes his imminent death.  On Thursday, the former dentist and Lunenburg town councillor will be transported in an ambulance to the QEII Health Sciences Centre in Halifax and will be the first Nova Scotian with ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) to be a multiple organ donor following a medically assisted death.  ""We've been through a lot of hurdles,"" Davis said.  But one thing that has not weakened is his determination to be an organ donor.  Davis was diagnosed with ALS, which is also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, in the fall of 2017.    He's spent the last few weeks of his life working with his palliative care team, his family and the Nova Scotia Health Authority to make being an organ donor happen.  ""With this difficult diagnosis that a person gets, it's like there's no good news, but now that I've inquired about being an organ donor, I think it's great news,"" he said.  ""Wouldn't you love to be leaving this beautiful world, but then sharing a life with a half a dozen people?  ""I mean a double lung, a heart, two kidneys and a liver — when you think that you could share life with potentially several other people, that's exciting.""  Uncharted waters  Davis, a former Marblehead sailor, found out was he was in uncharted waters because of his ALS and his age.  Davis, 71, who ran the Boston Marathon in 2014, is confident his heart and lungs are strong.  All the tests he's taken in the last two weeks have shown he's an excellent donor candidate.  Dr. Stephen Beed, the medical director of Nova Scotia's Legacy of Life and critical care organ donation program, said Davis's situation is unusual.  ""Organ donation after medical assistance in dying is very uncommon. It's becoming more common as people in that situation recognize the opportunity,"" Beed said.  Davis hopes to inspire others  Beed said people considering medically assisted death usually have health conditions that would exclude them from being donors. But in Davis's case, that wouldn't be the situation.  ""We want to do our best to respect his wishes and make it happen,"" Beed said.  Davis hopes his decision inspires others to become organ donors, especially people with ALS.  ""I want to let every ALS society across Canada to know what people with ALS can potentially do and I think it will make their journey a lot easier,"" Davis said.  ""Up until now, the only thing that kept us going was the hope there would be a cure discovered before we go.  ""But now to know there is something so positive that you could do, I think people will take it on when you think of the joy it would bring you to help others.""  'The least we can do is to make it happen'  Now that he's been cleared to donate, Thursday is the day his organs will be harvested.  Davis does not see his decision as heroic or selfless, but others do.  ""It's remarkable that in the midst of his health crises, he is being generous and he and his family are thinking that in his death other people can live,"" Beed said.  ""And that is huge. For him to be thinking of other people at this time in his life is pretty amazing.  And if he is going to think that way, then the least we can do is to make it happen.""    Sitting on their front porch in Lunenburg with his wife, Susan Atkinson, and stepdaughters, Alison and Becky Keen, they all marvel at his desire to give back right until the end.  ""From a family's perspective, it's such a deep lesson. Pride doesn't even do it. The lesson we are learning from this is that you can be so selfless, as Brian is being in this,"" said Becky Keen.  ""That is a gift I will carry, that my children will carry and we will all carry it. That's huge.""  Davis hopes others in need of an organ will carry a part of him too.

289,"Unnecessary vitamin B12 shots costing Ontario millions, study finds","Almost two-thirds of Ontario seniors who received vitamin B12 shots had no evidence of a B12 deficiency, according to a study published in the medical journal JAMA Internal Medicine.  The study used databases at the Toronto-based Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences to review the patient records of 146,850 residents of the province aged 65 or over who were prescribed regular vitamin B12 shot between January 2011 and October 2015.  Of those, 93,615 (64 per cent) either had tests confirm they already had normal B12 levels, or they weren't tested at all.  ""We know that's a lot of inappropriate care that happens in Canada,"" said study co-author Dr. William Silverstein of the University of Toronto. ""But we were quite surprised that it was the number was as high as it was.""  Silverstein and his colleagues calculated the inappropriately prescribed shots needlessly cost the province's health-care system $45.6 million annually.  Tablets just as effective  Over-the-counter B12 tablets are a fraction of the cost of shots, and have been shown in a British-Canadian study to work just as well for most people, although some people with digestive conditions may have difficulty absorbing the vitamin in tablet form.  B12 is found in animal-based sources such as meat, fish, poultry, eggs, and dairy products.  People who don't get enough of the essential vitamin can experience nausea, fatigue, dizziness or depression among other symptoms. Long-term deficiency can lead to cognitive problems.      Research suggests about 20 per cent of elderly people are B12 deficient. Although a Statistics Canada population survey published in 2013 found, on average, seniors had only slightly lower levels of B12 than younger adults.  Vegans and ""patients with diseases like Crohn's and colitis as well as people with pernicious anemia are also particularly vulnerable to deficiency,"" added Silverstein.  The Toronto specialist said that the price tag for a monthly shot is $44.33 — $33.70 paid to the doctor per visit, $6.74 for administering the shot and $3.89 for the vial of B12.  Orally administered supplements from a big box store cost as little as $30 for a full year's supply of tablets.    Silverstein said he decided to investigate the over-prescribing of B12 shots, because ""as an internal medicine resident, I have seen many patients come into the emergency department, and they were getting B12 injections without having a really good reason for it.""  His study could not determine why family physicians were prescribing it inappropriately — including whether it was initiated by the doctor or at the request of the patient.      [My doctor] said to me, 'I don't know how you're standing on your feet. Your B12 is so low.'  - Kema Dwarka, 79     Silverstein also said he didn't know if over-prescription was a problem in other provinces.   Still, there's little doubt about how debilitating a B12 deficiency can be.  When 79-year-old Kema Dwarka went to her family doctor with complaints of fatigue and low energy, a blood test revealed a serious problem. ""She said to me, 'I don't know how you're standing on your feet. Your B12 is so low'. And so she gave me a shot in the arm.""   The Toronto woman said she switched to an over-the-counter supplement once her levels returned to normal.  B12's star power  Still, some people swear by B12 shots.  The shots have gained popularity after being used by celebrities, such as Rihanna and Katy Perry, because they're promoted as a means to boost energy levels. Injections or vitamin drips are also offered by naturopathic doctors and spas promising instant results.      But Dr. Samir Sinha, who was not involved in the research, said B12 shots can't provide ""a big boost.""   ""Getting B12 shouldn't instantly make you feel great or more powerful,"" he said. ""People who really believe that … that's the power of placebo.""    As a geriatrician at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, Sinha said he commonly tests for B12 levels in patients ""when we're assessing a person for dementia or a person with balance issues.""  Otherwise he said it's ineffective to take B12 supplements to prevent deficiency — and there are even potential risks of over-doing it.  Only a handful of people  Sinha pointed to a recent study published in the online journal of JAMA which found an association between high intakes of vitamins B6 and B12 and hip fractures in older women.  Sinha said he only prescribes shots to patients for whom tablets can't be absorbed properly during digestion. ""I'd say maybe only a handful of people at most in the last 10 years have I ever actually thought would benefit from B12 injections.""    As to why some physicians would be needlessly prescribing B12 shots, he said, ""It may be just habit. But clearly I think what the study showed was that this is a practice that's probably happening more often in Ontario than it should be happening.""  Silverstein, a recent graduate of medical school, remembered that little time was spent on the appropriate treatment of B12 deficiency.  ""I recall there was one slide in my class that said you treat B12 deficiency with a pill or an injection. And that was it.""",health
290,What you need to know if you have a disability and want to vote,"If you're one of the six million or so Canadians who identify as having at least one disability, there are new tools and services available to help you vote.  Many were developed with the input and experience of an advisory group struck in 2014 specifically to address some of the biggest obstacles people with different abilities face when they go to cast a ballot.  Some of the tools and measures are being used in an election for the first time.  Here's a guide to what's available:  Polling stations  Whether you use a wheelchair or a cane or other form of assistance to get around, you should be able to easily access your polling station. There are specific accessibility criteria laid out by Elections Canada — including some that are mandatory.  For example, if there are stairs, there needs to be a ramp that is wide enough to accommodate a wheelchair or scooter. Doors need to be easy to open. And the actual room where you vote needs to be on the same level as the entrance.   Jewelles Smith, who is part of the Advisory Group for Disability Issues (AGDI), which has been working with Elections Canada, said it goes beyond just being able to get in the polling station door.   For those in a wheelchair, access can mean ""not having things so high that you can't reach to make your mark,"" she said. Making sure your ballot doesn't slip while using the braille reader, or that the pencils are the right size are also important.  ""The pencils were really terrible previously,"" Smith said. The first new batch wasn't much better either. ""So Elections Canada went back, got different pencils, and then we trialled them again.""   The result? Better grip, making the ability to mark the ballot easier. It makes a difference, Smith said.   But it's not just about the tools. It also matters how polling station staff is trained, Smith said. ""Don't assume what somebody needs by looking at them. Ask 'what can I do to assist you to vote?'""  The ballot  The ballot itself has changed since 2015 to accommodate larger text. It's also been optimized to be read by screen readers. And visually impaired Canadians can bring their own communication device or screen reader to use behind the voting screen.   One recommendation of the AGDI was to also put photos of each candidate beside their name. According to Elections Canada, doing so would require a change by Parliament to the Elections Act.   What else is there for people who are visually impaired?  Whether you are voting in advance or on election day, these tools and services are available:     magnifiers with light (4x)   a tactile and braille voting template   large-print lists of candidates   braille lists of candidates (available on election day only)   voting screens that let in more light   large pencils    John Rae, who lives in Toronto and is blind, wants further choices — such as voting by phone or electronically. ""Any of these options would make it possible to vote independently and verify independently in secret.""  Smith said privacy and independence are also important to the AGDI and it continues to push Elections Canada in that direction.   What if I am hearing impaired?  Elections Canada will ensure there is someone who can translate to American Sign Language or Langue des signes québécoise available when you go to vote.  The voter information card that you receive in the mail has information on how to request the service ahead of election day.   Other assisted listening devices, such as CART captioning, a hearing loop, an FM or an infrared system, will not be  available at polling stations.  Can I bring someone to help me vote?  Yes. Elections Canada allows Canadians to bring someone to the polling station to help them mark their ballot. That can be your spouse, your friend, or your personal support worker. That person is even allowed to help another voter if the need arises.   The assistant needs to be at least 18 years old — but does not even need to be eligible to vote themselves. They simply need to make a solemn declaration that they will respect the secrecy of your vote.  What if I can't get to the polling station?  There is always an option to vote by mail or go to any Elections Canada office before election day to cast a ballot.   And if you live in a long-term care home or a hospital, you can likely vote there. Elections Canada has mobile voting stations, and they can even bring the ballot box from room to room if patients are confined to bed.   But for people who simply can't leave their private home to vote, like Susan Stenson of Red Deer, Alta., there is another, little-known option.   She asked Elections Canada to come to her. After several weeks of back and forth, and help from a local candidate, the agency agreed. They sent a returning officer to Stenson's home and she voted ""with no problem.""  ""There are so many potential voters who don't get to exercise their right because they don't even know they have the right.""   ""I didn't give up.""   That's voting. What about a more accessible campaign?  Smith said there have been a couple of significant changes made for 2019, again, on the recommendation of the AGDI.   Candidates who incur additional costs to make their local events or meetings fully accessible — including providing sign language translation — can have 90 per cent of the costs reimbursed, up to a maximum of $5,000.   ""We also pushed so that more people with disabilities could actually run as candidates,"" Smith said. As a result, Elections Canada will also reimburse any extra costs associated with being a candidate with a disability.  And debates?   The two official debates on Oct. 7 and 8 will have closed captioning, described video, and sign language translation — American Sign Language for the English debate, and Langue des signes québécoise for the French.   But Rae, who is also on the Canadian Council of Canadians for Disabilities, points to a persistent failing. ""We have never to my knowledge had a question about a disability issue asked during the debates."" He's hopeful that, too, will change.     The Accessible Canada Act  Finally, some of our readers have wondered whether this new law will affect elections. Short answer is — maybe.   The Accessible Canada Act was just passed in late June. Before any changes to elections are made because of it, a few things have to happen first.  First, the Canadian Accessibility Standards Development Organization has to be created and the government has to pass regulations establishing standards in the areas covered by the Accessible Canada Act, including Elections Canada.   Once those regulations are law, Elections Canada says it will have one year to prepare a compliance report setting out whether it meets the standards set out in regulation. If it doesn't, it has to come up with a plan to achieve compliance.   ",health
291,U of C research calls for urgent MRIs for patients considered low risk for stroke,"A new study shows urgent MRI scans are key in diagnosing patients considered low risk for minor strokes and the findings are changing how Calgary hospitals deal with those patients.  The study, led by doctors at the University of Calgary and published in JAMA Neurology, followed 1028 patients from Canada, Australia and the Czech Republic over six years.  Researchers focused on patients who were deemed low-risk for minor strokes and ministrokes, known as TIAs, because their symptoms can be difficult to diagnose.    Their symptoms may mimic other health conditions such as migraines, seizure or reactions to stress. These patients may also have traditional stroke symptoms  (such as speech problems and paralysis or numbness) lasting less than five minutes.   ""The risk is that we can miss the diagnosis of TIA if the symptoms are not clear. We can also unnecessarily treat people with medications that can potentially cause harm when they don't need them,"" said Dr. Shelagh Coutts, University of Calgary stroke neurologist and principal investigator.    According to Coutts, it's important doctors get that diagnosis right because the risk of a full-fledged stroke increases after a TIA.  During the six year study, patients in the low-risk group were given detailed exams by neurologists and sent for an MRI scan within eight days of first experiencing symptoms.  ""We found some surprising things,"" said Coutts.  ""We found a higher risk of stroke than we expected in this lower-risk population where we're not clear what's happening.""  The MRI brain scans revealed 13.5 per cent of those with unclear symptoms had actually experienced a stroke. And in 30 per cent of cases, the diagnosis was changed based on the MRI findings.  ""And so what we found was in patients where its not clear what's happening often an MRI scan can help.""  Treatment changes in Calgary  The study concludes low-risk patients should receive an MRI within the first week of symptom onset and Calgary hospitals have changed their protocols as a result.  ""These lower risk patients, we are now seeing more quickly than we ever used to be and we're also getting MRI scans way more quickly because of this,"" said Coutts.    Drs. Margy McCullough-Hicks and Gregory Albers of Stanford University's neurology department in California wrote a journal editorial accompanying the study.  McCullough-Hicks and Albers applauded the authors for what they called an ""important study.""  The editorial encouraged  the stroke community to increase the use of MRI on patients like those involved in the research. Albers also declared a potential financial conflict of interest with an imaging technology company.    'Peace of Mind' for patients  Matthew Miller, 47, discovered he'd suffered a mini-stroke earlier this year.  He woke up one morning in July and couldn't feel one of his hands.  ""I tried to drink some water. It fell out of my face. I went to talk to my girlfriend and I could not speak,"" said Miller who was rushed by ambulance to a Calgary hospital.  Those symptoms disappeared within minutes so Miller was deemed low risk. Because of the changes that came about as a result of the study, Miller was given an urgent MRI. Once doctors discovered he'd suffered a TIA, they began treating him with medication to prevent a much bigger stroke down the line.  The findings also prompted doctors to investigate further and they discovered a hole in his heart was to blame.  ""Now they can go in and patch that hole, which should hopefully greatly reduce future strokes for me,"" said Miller who is relieved to have a formal diagnosis and to know what's going on inside his body.  ""The clarity as to what's actually going on, what has happened, and what is the path toward correcting that brings a lot of peace of mind.""",health
292,"Americans could use a spoonful less sugar in their diets, researchers say ","Americans' diets are a little less sweet and a little crunchier but there's still too much sugar, white bread and artery-clogging fat, a study suggests.  Overall, the authors estimated there was a modest improvement over 16 years on the government's healthy eating index, from estimated scores of 56 to 58. That's hardly cause for celebration — 100 is the top score.  Diets are still too heavy on foods that can contribute to heart disease, diabetes, obesity and other prevalent U.S. health problems, said co-author Fang Fang Zhang, a nutrition researcher at Tufts University near Boston.  The study was published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The results are from an analysis of U.S. government health surveys from 1999 to 2016 involving nearly 44,000 adults.  ""Despite observed improvements,"" the authors wrote, ""important dietary challenges"" remain.  Among them: Getting Americans to cut down on snack foods, hot dogs, fatty beef, butter and other foods containing saturated fats. The study found these unhealthy fats increased from 11.5 per cent to almost 12 per cent of daily calories, above the recommended 10 per cent limit.  And while the biggest change was a small drop in added sugars, from about 16 per cent to roughly 14 per cent, that's still too high. The U.S. and other governments say less than 10 per cent of daily calories should come from added sugars. Researchers think fewer sweetened sodas contributed to the decline, but Zhang noted added sugars are often found in foods that don't even seem sweet, including some yogurts and tomato sauce.    Fruits, nuts, oatmeal and other whole grains are among the types of foods adults ate slightly more of. Still, each of those contributed to less than 5 per cent of daily calories in 2016, the study found.  Salt intake dipped slightly and a small decline in fruit juice contributed to a drop in low-quality carbs. But these still amount to 42 per cent of daily calories, including many likely from highly processed white bread and other refined grains, Zhang said.    The study is based on in-person health surveys conducted every two years that ask adults to recall what foods they ate in the previous 24 hours. Starting in 2003, adults were asked that question twice several days apart.    The study lists food groups rather than individual foods; for example ""whole grains,"" not oatmeal, and ""refined grains,"" not white bread but Zhang said those two foods are among the most common grains in the U.S. diet.  U.S. dietary guidelines recommend a ""healthy eating pattern"" to reduce chances of developing chronic disease. The focus should be on nutrient-dense foods including:     Vegetables, fruits, whole grains.   Low-fat dairy products.   Varied proteins sources including seafood, lean meats and poultry, eggs nuts and seeds.    During the study years, U.S. diabetes rates almost doubled, to more than 7 per cent; obesity rates increased during many of those years, with about 70 per cent of U.S. adults now overweight or obese. Heart disease remains the leading cause of death.  Besides continued public health efforts, ""Cooperation from the food industry"" is key, a journal editorial said, including by reducing sugar, salt and saturated fats in foods.",health
293,"Vaping industry insiders demand to know brand in London, Ont., teen's near-fatal illness","London, Ont.'s medical officer of health says he won't give in to vaping industry demands that he release the name of the brand used by a high school student who was on life-support after using a vaping device, the first such reported illness linked to the practice in Canada.   Last week, Dr. Chris Mackie of the Middlesex-London Health Unit said the teenager's near-fatal respiratory illness was linked to vaping. During Wednesday's news conference, Mackie was asked what brand was used when the student fell ill, but Mackie refused to release the information.  Since then, industry insiders, including manufacturers and store owners, have written emails to Mackie — copying Ontario Health Minister Christine Elliott, a number of government health agencies and media outlets — demanding he release the name of the vaping product.   But Mackie said Monday: ""The reality is their customers are at risk regardless of what brand they are vaping. People are getting sick from vaping and it's not associated with one brand.    ""Manufacturers and distributors want us to be believe this is some kind of bad actor. The reality is it seems to be more about the consumer, that certain people are more vulnerable. It does not appear to be a brand-related issue.""  Industry members, however, are still intent on finding out the name of the brand used by the student.  ""I am deeply concerned,"" Thomas Krisop, owner of Alternatives and Options Vaporizers and eLiquids, a vape store based in Morinville, Alta., told CBC News on Monday.    ""I have customers that have gone back to smoking. They're getting messages from their family members saying they should go back to smoking because smoking is better than vaping. Vaping will kill you.""  Mackie offered to review Krisop's inventory list, and has since informed him his Alberta store does not carry the product linked to the teenager's illness.   Now, others have sent their inventory lists to Mackie, wanting their products to be ruled out.   'I'm concerned'  Among them is Charles Byram, the founder and CEO of Moncton, N.B.-based e-liquid manufacturer FOV Labs.   ""The reason I wrote to Dr. Mackie is because I'm concerned, I want to know what made people sick,"" he told CBC News on Monday. ""If we keep that information away from the public, then we're not serving the public.  ""Once we find out what it is, we can act upon it,"" he said, noting he believes his product is not linked to the London teen's respiratory illness.   ""I'm 100 per cent sure our products weren't sold in London.""      Ontario teen was on life-support after respiratory illness linked to vaping     Byram said Mackie should have clarified what product was behind the teen's illness so people aren't led to believe all vaping is a health risk.   ""When you keep that kind of information from the public, it tends to scare smokers away from choosing a healthier product,"" he said, adding ""the term 'vaping' is being used very loosely.""    In the United States, there have been hundreds of cases of respiratory illnesses linked to vaping and at least seven deaths.  Health officials said the London teen is reportedly doing well since his release from hospital.  Mackie said that when compared to smoking, which still kills 20 million people a year worldwide, vaping is relatively safe.  ""You're setting the bar pretty low.""",health
294,Witnesses of Montreal Marathon runner's collapse challenge emergency response time,"An ambulance was requested at least four times before first responders arrived about 25 minutes after a participant in Montreal's half-marathon event collapsed and later died, sources tell Radio-Canada.  The Quebec coroner's office has launched an investigation into the death of Patrick Neely, 24, who collapsed about two kilometres from the finish line Sunday.  A police officer on the scene called three different times on her radio asking for an ambulance, and her partner called a fourth time, according to Radio-Canada sources.   Watching from the sidelines, spectator Josée Gagnon was one of the first to rush to Neely's side, offering him water and comfort until, finally, an ambulance arrived.  She said others, including a nurse, performed CPR on Neely while awaiting the ambulance.  By looking over her phone's history, Gagnon was able to figure out precisely how much time had passed.  ""I wondered if it was me who had lost track of time and that it had just taken four minutes. But that's not it. Finally, it was 25 minutes. It was not in my head,"" she said.  ""Why was the first call [from police] not heard?""  25 minutes before first responders arrived  Watching Neely turn blue with people crowding around, Gagnon eventually called 911 to ask what was taking so long, and an operator told her they had not yet received any calls about the incident.   Radio-Canada has since learned that the runner collapsed at 9:38 a.m.   Urgences-santé says it received the call at 9:55 a.m. First responders then arrived eight minutes later — by which time a full 25 minutes had passed.  Urgences-santé spokesperson Véronique Tremblay said the first call it received came from a female police officer, at 9:55 a.m. The officer had radioed in the incident to a police dispatcher, who in turn advised Urgences-santé.  Tremblay said two calls from citizens came after 9:55 a.m., but there is no report of any other calls before that time.  ""It is not known if people have tried to call for help before that,"" she said.  The agency is investigating the incident, meeting witnesses and looking into what happened.    ""We will have to meet everyone, and we will ask each other questions because we do not know. We have no idea,"" said another Urgences-santé spokesperson, Stéphane Smith.  Both spokespeople reiterated that race organizers had first-aid teams posted along the race route and ambulances on standby, ready to respond as needed.   Marathon organizers defend response time  Rock 'n' Roll Montreal Marathon race organizers issued a statement Monday afternoon offering ""sincere sympathies"" to Neely's family and friends while, at the same time, defending the medical response.  Medical personnel arrived at the scene with ""state-of-the-art"" rescue equipment and supplies within approximately eight minutes of the 911 call, the statement said.  Race organizers say they reached that conclusion based on timing and Neely's race pace data, as well as event logs and eyewitness accounts.    Organizers say everything was ready during the event to help runners in distress, and nearly a year has gone into planning medical support.  ""All resources were in place appropriately on race day, including more than 50 defibrillators and more than 80 health professionals on the course, as well as eight ambulances dedicated to the event,"" read the statement.  Race director Dominique Piché told CBC on Monday morning that his focus was on Neely's family and friends, extending his condolences to them. Piché declined to talk to CBC after a further request Tuesday.  Government reviews sporting event organization  On Monday, Quebec Health Minister Danielle McCann said that the government will review the way major sporting events are organized in the province.  Aside from having defibrillators available, there are other steps that can be taken to minimize risks, McCann said. She stressed that there will never be zero risk, however.  Studies have shown medical emergencies are most likely to occur near the finish line of long course events like the marathon.    ""Nearly 80 per cent of cardiac arrests occur within 1.5 kilometres of the finish line,"" said Dr. Martin Juneau, a cardiologist who called it ""curious"" that it took so long to get help to Neely.  Vincent Thibaudeau, an experienced marathoner who competed in Sunday's event, said there should always be medical teams posted along the last couple of kilometres of races.  ""It is necessary to plan to have more than one respondent at these locations andu002For more defibrillators,"" said Thibaudeau, who routinely runs in marathon races across North America.  ""The organization failed in its responsibilities.""",health
295,"Province seeking 50 new beds for those with meth, opioid, alcohol addictions","Fifty new beds to help people with drug and alcohol addictions are coming to Saskatchewan with the aim of reducing relapses, according to the Saskatchewan Health Authority.  The beds will fill the gap after a person finishes detox but doesn't yet have a spot in residential treatment, said an SHA news release. They are specifically meant for people who do not have stable or safe housing during that time or once they're done treatment.  Investing in people who need help during these times is significant, said Dr. Peter Butt, a leading addictions specialist in Saskatchewan.   ""It's a high-relapse period of time. We lose many, many people,"" Butt said on CBC Radio's Saskatoon Morning.  Butt said the new beds, where people will be able to deal with triggers and core issues, are a much better alternative than couch-surfing at crack houses or living on the streets.    A request for proposals, open to the private and public sectors, will close at the end of the month. The health authority says the goal is to have the beds operational this winter.  Butt said the only comparable service offered now is when rehabs leave beds open for people a few extra weeks after their initial treatment.  ""But that's not the norm. So there are a lot of people who go through detox and they're sent back out on the streets waiting for the treatment bed,"" Butt said.  Speaking to CBC on Monday, Health Minister Jim Reiter said the province is seeing more of a demand related to two types of drugs.  ""Crystal meth has become a huge problem in the province over a number of years. Opioids, of course, is a problem right across the country.""    Reiter said the new beds are a part of an investment into addictions treatment announced in the provincial budget this spring.  ""It's an issue that all provinces are grappling with as this problem becomes more prevalent. I think, though, you're going to see us make this a priority in the upcoming years as well.""  Butt is critical of the short duration of all steps of detox, rehab and these new beds. All told, it would top out at several months, even though it takes 12 months to consider someone as being in ""sustained remission.""  ""If we compare this to cancer, we don't stop part way and say, 'That's enough, that's good enough,' even though the evidence suggests it should be more, and turn people lose to deal with their cancer on their own,"" he said.  If the province is serious about recovery, there should be supports the whole way through those first 12 months of the addiction recovery journey, he said.  When the government announced the treatment beds in March, finance critic Trent Wotherspoon said longer rehab and treatment are what's needed, particularly with crystal meth.  ",health
296,Trudeau pitched family doctors for everyone. But B.C. already tried that and failed,"A campaign promise by federal Liberal leader Justin Trudeau about making sure all Canadians have access to a family doctor might feel a little bit like déjà vu in British Columbia.  A key platform for the B.C. Liberals in 2010 — which they doubled down on in 2013 — was that everyone who wanted a family doctor would be able to have one by 2015; a program remembered as A GP for Me.  Former health minister Margaret MacDiarmid in 2013 reiterating the government's commitment to A GP for Me     Well, 2015 arrived. And while there was progress including the training of more family physicians, hundreds of thousands of British Columbians still had no family doctor.  Now, many in the healthcare industry, like family physician Dr. Rita McCracken, are wondering how such a complex problem could work on a federal level when it failed provincially.    Across the province, around 780,000 people are without a primary care doctor or nurse practitioner, according to the government of B.C.  One of them is Alyssa Koehn.  When she moved back to Vancouver two years ago, she struggled to find a family doctor. After six months of searching, she found a doctor and only because ""she knew someone who knew someone"" that had a new physician start at their clinic.  But due to her new doctor's busy schedule — she continuously cancelled appointments on her — Koehn is now once again on the hunt for a primary-care physician.  ""It's not been great,"" she said, reflecting on the process.  Koehn has hypothyroidism, which requires regular blood tests every six months. Instead of seeing a regular doctor who knows her medical history and has all the results of her past blood tests, she has to visit a walk-in clinic ""on the outskirts of town.""   Every time she visits a new clinic, she has to fill the doctor-of-the-day in on her case and get another blood test.  ""If I could just have someone I could regularly trust to see, I would be less of an impact on the medical system,"" said Koehn.  Why A GP for Me didn't work  Dr. Rita McCracken has no doubt that better access to family doctors will mean healthier British Columbians. But, putting that dream into practice is a whole different problem, one the medical industry in B.C. has been working on for 15 years.  ""Unfortunately, we haven't really moved the yardstick forward,"" said McCracken, who is also an assistant professor at UBC.    She said there are a few reasons why A GP for Me was unsuccessful.  A primary focus of the program was to offer physicians a financial incentive to take on more patients with complex needs, which McCracken says completely ignored the fact patient lists were already at capacity and doctors were working as hard as possible.  ""Simply providing an incentive fee...was inadequate,"" she said.  What was — and still is — needed, she says, is structural change.  Right now, the family physician model revolves around owning a business and includes all the overhead costs that accompany a brick and mortar shop — but there's a change to how the next generation of doctors wants to work, said McCracken.  ""New graduates are choosing work patterns that allow them to be human beings and parents and not just family doctors,"" she said.  Finally, for a sustainable primary care system to succeed, McCracken says B.C. needs to move away from the traditional fee-for-service pay structure for family physicians and, instead, adopt a salary model.    B.C. changes underway  B.C.'s NDP government has promised changes to primary care, including more than a dozen team-based primary care networks, which are meant to streamline referrals between family doctors, nurse practitioners and other health care providers.  The province has also promised money for up to 200 new general practioners to work in the team-based care model, and 10 new urgent primary care centres that will help those without a family doctor or nurse practitioner.",health
297,Canadian Indigenous water activist Autumn Peltier addresses UN on clean water,"Canadian Indigenous water activist Autumn Peltier, 15, addressed hundreds of international guests at UN headquarters in Manhattan on Saturday, where she urged the global community to respect the sacredness and importance of clean water.  ""I've said it once, and I'll say it again: we can't eat money or drink oil,"" said the activist from Wiikwemkoong First Nation on Manitoulin Island in northern Ontario.  Peltier spoke at the Global Landscapes Forum, a platform on sustainable land use founded by UN Environment and the World Bank that's dedicated to achieving development and climate goals.  She used the speech to draw attention to the lack of clean water in numerous Indigenous communities, which she says sparked her activism.  ""All across these lands, we know somewhere where someone can't drink the water. Why so many, and why have they gone without for so long?""  Watch Autumn Peltier speak at the UN:     She said she's been taught traditional knowledge from an early age about the sacredness of water, and that more people should learn these lessons.  ""Maybe, we need to have more elders and youth together sitting at the decision table when people make decisions about our lands and waters.""  Peltier called for an end to plastic use as one step in restoring a more sustainable world.  Her speech comes a day after huge crowds took to the streets in Canada as part of a global climate strike.  The speech was her second at the UN headquarters, having urged the General Assembly to ""warrior up"" and take a stand for our planet last year.    Peltier, who is nominated for the 2019 International Children's Peace Prize by the David Suzuki Foundation, has spread her message at hundreds of events around the world.  In 2015, Peltier attended the Children's Climate Conference in Sweden, and a year later, confronted Prime Minister Justin Trudeau about his ""broken promises"" at a meeting of the Assembly of First Nations.  She was named the chief water commissioner by the Anishinabek Nation, a political advocacy group for 40 First Nations across Ontario, when she was just 14 years old.",technology
298,We asked 3 companies to recycle Canadian plastic and secretly tracked it. Only 1 company recycled the material,"Do you know where your recycling really goes after it's been picked up?  After several instances of Canadian plastic waste turning up overseas in places like the Philippines and Malaysia, CBC's Marketplace wanted to track the lifecycle of Canadian plastic.  Journalists bought bales of film plastic ready for recycling, hid trackers inside them, and then re-inserted the plastic back into the recycling stream in British Columbia — the province known for having the most efficient recycling program in Canada.    Using an alias email, Marketplace reached out and commissioned three major waste collection businesses with ties to municipal programs in B.C. to process the material. The bales were picked up by Merlin Plastics, Waste Connections of Canada, and GFL Environmental Inc.  All three companies make green promises on their websites and in promotional videos, using buzzwords like ""sustainability"" and ""environmental solutions."" One Waste Connections video goes as far as to say, ""sustainability and becoming more green … have been hallmarks and backbones of Waste Connections from the day we formed the company.""  Marketplace put those promises to the test, acquiring about nine tonnes of film plastic, mostly shopping bags, that had already been sorted and crushed into square bales. Since the bales were already compressed and ready for processing, the trackers wouldn't get crushed or lost in the sorting process.    Next, the Basel Action Network, a U.S. charity that combats exports of hazardous waste from industrialized countries and specializes in tracking waste, installed tracking devices into nine bales — three for each company.  Once activated, the tracking devices pinged every two to three minutes with their geographical co-ordinates. Although three trackers failed, two for each company reached a final destination.  Only 1 company recycled the plastic  The two trackers in Merlin Plastics' bales ended up at a recycling processing plant in Delta, B.C., suggesting it was recycled. The company later confirmed in a statement to Marketplace that it ""shredded, washed and pelletized it, then sold the resin to a customer that make[s] similar material.""    Both of the GFL trackers went straight to a waste-to-energy facility, a landfill alternative that creates power by incinerating garbage. The harmful acid gases emitted through the burning process become trapped in the incinerator and are then treated with chemical ""scrubbers"" that convert them into neutral salts.  ""I think most Canadians think that when they put something in recycling, that it's being re-fashioned into something that can be used,"" said Myra Hird, an environmental studies professor at Queen's University and founder of Canada's Waste Flow research group.    One problem with incineration as a recycling solution, Hird says, is that the waste-to-energy incinerators constantly need to be fed large amounts of material. Another concern is the toxic ash incineration leaves behind.  ""That waste that is produced then has to be landfilled in very [specific], highly engineered landfills for hazardous waste,"" she said. ""It's far more toxic than the original products.""  In a written statement, GFL told Marketplace that while traditional recycling would have been a preferable solution, no one would have been willing to buy the processed plastic.     Also on Marketplace this week: Canada's plastic scrap dumped and burned overseas    ""The current market conditions do not have many opportunities to recycle this kind of plastic,"" said GFL. ""We found a viable and cost-effective solution in incineration.""  Meanwhile, when Waste Connections picked up the bales of plastic, the company said it would send the material to a recycling facility. However, the trackers showed that the bales ended up in a junkyard in Surrey, B.C., as well as a landfill in Richmond, B.C.     When Marketplace reached out to Waste Connections looking for further information, the company did not respond directly; it instead emailed the original alias and said: ""There was some miscommunication and the driver took this load to a waste facility.""  It is not unusual for Canadian plastics to be landfilled. A recent study published by the federal Ministry of Environment and Climate Change revealed plastics are landfilled 86 per cent of the time.  'That's discouraging'  ""This is the opposite of what I think is happening to that magical blue box when it gets put out,"" said Natasha Sumera, of Burnaby, B.C.  Like many Canadians, Sumera diligently sorts, cleans and recycles her waste every week. But she then goes even further to do her part for the environment.   Her municipality doesn't pick up polystyrene products, so the 32-year-old spends time each week sorting through her condo building's styrofoam and taking it to a recycling plant herself.  ""Even when you make an effort to put it in the blue bin, if it still ends up here, that's discouraging,"" she said.    Hird said one reason Canadian plastic ends up burned or landfilled is the companies we trust to recycle that material aren't always obligated to do it.  B.C.'s Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy told Marketplace that haulers are contractually obligated to ensure residential plastic is recycled.   If the bales had been ""collected from a residential premise and the hauler took it to a disposal facility, the hauler would be in violation of its contract,"" the ministry said in a statement. However, waste collected outside the blue box program, from industrial, commercial or institutional sectors, ""does not legally have to be recycled.""  ""[They] are only going to recycle materials if there's a profit to be made,"" Hird said.    Profit varies depending on market conditions, she says, so a type of plastic that might have been recycled in January might be landfilled in December.    ""I think it's unethical because it's deceiving Canadians,"" she said.  Even when recycling does work, Hird says it takes a large toll on the environment, often being shipped to countries across the world to be fashioned into things like picture frames or other non-food-grade items, after which the quality of the plastic is often too low to be recycled again.  ""We perhaps get one more use out of it and then it goes to landfill.""  She says Canadians should be focusing more on the top two tiers of the waste hierarchy: reduce and reuse.  9% of Canadian plastic recycled    The plastics industry has another explanation as to why recyclable plastic is being landfilled.   ""It was too easy to ship material to China,"" said Joe Hruska, vice-president of sustainability for the Canadian Plastics Industry Association.""They would take anything, and they'd actually pay for it.""  Now that China has shut its doors to our waste, Hruska says the government needs to put incentives in place for manufacturers to use recycled material here at home, to create a local market.  Behind the scenes: Marketplace installs GPS trackers in plastic bales    According to Greenpeace, nearly half of Canada's plastic waste exports were sent to China before the country cut its imports of scrap plastic in 2018.   Even when China was an option, the federal study of Canada's plastic industry markets shows only nine per cent of Canadian plastics were getting recycled.   That means of the 3.3 million metric tonnes of plastic consumed by Canadians in a year, about 2.8 million metric tonnes were thrown away as garbage.  Bag bans vs. industry pushback  There's been a global push to reduce our reliance on plastic, with a number of jurisdictions across Canada and around the world putting forth regulations, particularly around plastic bags. The federal government recently announced a plan to ban most single-use plastics by 2021.  But there has been pushback from industry who are fighting legislation that would ban bags from grocery stores. One of the CPIA's members even went to the B.C. Superior Court to fight a plastic bag ban in Victoria. The city plans to seek a Supreme Court of Canada challenge.   Hruska argues meaningful alternatives to plastic grocery bags don't yet exist and that he thinks bag fees are motivation enough to reduce consumers' use. He also says his members are working on new technologies to make low-value plastics more recyclable.    But Hird says we can't rely on the plastic industry to reduce plastic waste.   ""Waste management is extremely expensive,"" she said. ""Industries are set up to do what they're set up to do — which is to make profit.  ""What we need is a very strong government that is going to really introduce far stricter — and a greater number of — regulations around how we deal with our waste.""     The federal Ministry of Environment and Climate Change says it has committed to new restrictions on plastic that is sent overseas starting in 2021.  It also has plans to reduce plastic waste and pollution at home with new policies like the single-use plastic ban, and consistent ""extended producer responsibility"" programs that would make plastic producers responsible for the cost of recycling it.  But Myra hopes to see more incentives for reduction and refurbishment. ""At the top of [the] waste hierarchy is reduction, and that is what we really want,"" she said. ""Recycling should be really done as a last resort.""  As for Natasha Sumera, even though she's disappointed to learn what may happen to her blue box items, she says she'll keep on making the drive with her building's recyclables.  ""I want to be optimistic,"" she said. ""I try to reduce, but this, even more so, drives that home … If it's not getting recycled the way that I think it should be, then I should probably even use less.""",technology
299,"Verafin's quiet, huge success: Canada's largest venture funding deal goes to an N.L. company","On Wednesday, Canada's largest-ever venture funding deal was made for $515 million — a sizeable sum of money by any measure — going to a world leader in providing financial crime management software to financial institutions.  The lucky recipient of more than half a billion dollars in funding is one of this country's largest tech companies using artificial intelligence and isn't based in Toronto. It's not based in Vancouver, or in the Kitchener-Waterloo tech hub that built up around BlackBerry.  The company is called Verafin, and it's based here in Newfoundland and Labrador, with most of its 500 or so employees working out of St. John's — a homegrown success story bolstering a growing tech industry that many in this province are largely unaware of.  ""Partially by design,"" Verafin co-founder and product specialist Brendan Brothers said, laughing. ""We have tried to stay under the radar a little bit.""   That is changing somewhat with this deal, which shone a light not just on Verafin but on the surrounding players that have both helped the company — which works with almost 3,000 banks and credit unions in Canada and the United States to detect activity like fraud and money laundering — grow over the past 16 years and have benefited from its expansion and international success.  ""It's already been generating quite a bit of interest in Genesis over the last 24 to 36 hours,"" said Michelle Simms, the CEO of Memorial University's Genesis Centre, where Verafin spent its first few years and where its founders now work with startups in the tech industry it now anchors.      This is a major, major, major investment of capital.  - Paul Preston     Simms is uniquely placed to know about Verafin's success, and wasn't surprised the company brought in new funding. The deal's size, however, was a ""big, pleasant surprise,"" she said.   Paul Preston, CEO of the Newfoundland and Labrador Association of Technology Industries, was similarly enthusiastic. ""It's huge,"" he said. ""This is a major, major, major investment of capital.""  That capital is significant for St. John's, where Verafin is by far the largest of the province's 80 digital technology firms, with annual revenues of $1.5 billion — more than the traditional fishery, tourism or farming in the province. Those revenues increased eight per cent each year between 2014 and 2017 — more than the national rate of five per cent, according to a report of digital technology firms in Atlantic Canada released by the Atlantic Provinces Economic Council earlier this month.  It's a small tech industry compared withToronto or Vancouver, but it's here — and there's no reason why it shouldn't be, Brothers said.    ""We always joke with our customers, there's a natural moat around this island,"" Brothers said. In Silicon Valley, the next big thing is always right around the corner, he said, but in Newfoundland and Labrador, people tend to stay put if they enjoy their work and the company they're doing it for.    ""We give people an interesting problem to work on, and we create an environment where people want to work,"" Brothers said.   ""And I don't think there's any reason that we can't do that from here.""  The Verafin story  About a decade and a half ago, Brothers, Jamie King and Raymond Pretty were doing graduate work in robotics software at Memorial University when they met alumnus David Kelly, who had identified a problem with money laundering and fraud in the banking industry.   ""He came back to the engineering business schools and basically said, 'This is something that somebody could probably do something about,'"" Brothers said.  At the time their research focused on artificial intelligence and decision-making, Brothers said, but that technology could also be applied to identifying financial crime. So Brothers, King and Pretty — all three of whom are still with Verafin today — pivoted.  To understand what Verafin does, think about credit card fraud: credit card companies phone customers when they notice unusual activity on their accounts, to ensure that nothing fraudulent or unapproved is happening.      If we focus on that underlying crime, and think about that as the motivation, you're not just building software, you're actually doing good.  - Brendan Brothers     ""It's that kind of idea, but more broadly applied to different kinds of fraud and different kinds of unusual activity,"" Brothers said.  The company's software scours financial transactions for unusual patterns that indicate fraud, money laundering and human trafficking. With its cloud-based system and machine-learning algorithms, which analyze enormous amounts of financial data shared by the banks and credit unions Verafin works with, the company can flag suspicious activity that can then be investigated for criminal ties.   The trio first began this work in a MUN research project, before deciding in 2003 decided to make a go of the company. For Verafin's first several years, they were hosted by the Genesis Centre's startup incubator program. That experience was invaluable, Brothers said — they were surrounded by like-minded people who were also trying to figure out how to start a business. It also helped them find their very first customer.  ""We went far and wide, travelled the world, everywhere looking for our first customer,"" Brothers said, ""until somebody on our board of advisors was like, 'Well, have you ever tried asking Newfoundland and Labrador Credit Union?'""  They had not. It turned out that the province's credit union had the same issues with money laundering and financial crime as any other financial institution. They took a chance on Verafin and became their first customer, which led the company to focus on credit unions in other parts of the country: throughout Atlantic Canada, the Prairies, British Columbia, Ontario.      You're not just building software, you're actually doing good.  - Brendan Brothers     A few years later, Verafin launched into the United States, Brothers said. That was a different landscape: more than 10,000 financial institutions there versus about 400 in Canada. For more than a decade the company has focused on the U.S., with apparent success. In the first quarter of 2019, Verafin hit $100 million in annual recurring revenue — growth of 87 per cent since the beginning of 2017. Sales bookings and deal size at the company each grew by more than 100 per cent between 2017 and 2019.   That growth comes from successfully identifying those fraudulent patterns for financial institutions, and the challenging problem solving involved there is part of the motivation, Brothers said. But in more recent years for Verafin, the underlying crime — and its human victims — has shifted into focus and become key to their motivation as a company, Brothers said.    ""Whether it's human trafficking, drug trafficking, terrorist financing — those are the reasons that people launder money, because they've committed some kind of crime,"" he said.     ""If we focus on that underlying crime, and think about that as the motivation, you're not just building software, you're actually doing good. I think that's pretty powerful for a lot of people here.""  The talent pipeline  With the growth sure to come from its new funding deal, it's clear which challenge Verafin must tackle next: finding the talent it needs to both continue its own expansion and to fuel the growth of the tech sector surrounding it.  For now, that often means looking outside the province, Brothers said, either to lure back expat Newfoundlanders and Labradorians or to draw in graduates from more robust computer science programs at schools in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.      We see one company that's thriving and other companies now know that it's possible to do the same.  - Michelle Simms     It also means hiring new Canadians — Brothers estimated that 20 per cent of Verafin's workforce is made up of international hires. And the company is working to encourage high school students to consider careers in tech, he said, in order to keep that talent pipeline flowing.  Increasing the number of tech-focused college and university graduates is another piece of the hiring puzzle, for Verafin and the other tech companies in the province. Getting the talent needed to sustain and grow the province's tech sector is that sector's biggest challenge right now and NATI's top priority, Preston said.  ""Our ability to really benefit from that $500-million investment is going to be directly related to, can we get people to work here, stay here, attract people here?"" he said. ""So we need to figure out how we're going to address the talent gap.""  The size of the province's digital labour force increased by 11 per cent between 2011 and 2016, but the share of Newfoundlanders and Labradorians in the labour force in digital occupations was Atlantic Canada's lowest at 2.9 per cent. The Brookfield Institute has predicted that about 2,000 tech positions will need to be filled in the province in the next three to five years, Preston said, but right now MUN and the College of the North Atlantic are producing just a few dozen graduates a year for those positions.    ""We don't have two years to figure this out,"" Preston said of the trickle coming through the province's tech talent pipeline. ""We've got to move fast.""   That work has begun at multiple levels. At CNA, next fall's planned relaunch of its software engineering program comes in direct response to that need in the local tech industry, says Stephen Warren, dean of CNA's school of business and information technology.   ""There's no doubt that right now the big need in the province is entry-level software developers,"" Warren said.  To help meet that need, in the fall of 2020 the college will offer three-year software development programs with a paid co-op component to 25 students each in both St. John's and Corner Brook. A cybersecurity program is also in the works, and the school expects growth in tech sector to also fuel continued interest in its business programs focused on human resources, marketing and accounting, he said.  Simms acknowledged that talent recruitment is a challenge for the sector, but it's one she's confident that all parties working together can solve.  ""We see one company that's thriving, and other companies now know that it's possible to do the same,"" she said.  Homegrown success story  Verafin has long since outgrown the Genesis Centre and now runs out of its headquarters on Hebron Way, with a Starbucks located on the same lot and parking garages under construction out front.  Inside, lounge areas are mixed in with open-concept workspaces. Growing units from Sucseed, another company that got its start at MUN, add pops of green to the red, grey and white colour scheme, and point to Verafin's continued work with Genesis.    Simms said she still sees most of the 30 employees who were with Verafin when it left Genesis on her visits to its new headquarters. Verafin employees make the trip to Genesis headquarters as well; members of its management team are on the Genesis board, and the company provides strategic guidance to startups in its incubator.   ""They're quite committed to the tech sector in the province, and to giving back to the tech sector,"" she said.  Part of that commitment comes from their conviction that Newfoundland and Labrador should — and can — have 10 companies like Verafin, not just one, Brothers said.  ""We're generally not competing with each other, so there's a reason for us all to help each other to kind of do this,"" he said of the existing tech firms in the province, which include CoLab Software, Mysa and Genoa. Verafin's financial success so far has helped to fuel other companies in the province — Killick Capital was one of the company's earliest investors, and the money made there has been reinvested in several other startups.  ""When we create success, I think we can continue to create that success,"" Brothers said.   ""That's personally one of the things that I think is so exciting about this. We need 10 Verafins here, we don't need one, and let's find out how to try and create those.""  Read more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador",technology
300,Canadians rally across country to call for bolder action on climate change,"Hundreds of thousands of Canadians attended marches across the country to urge government and corporate leaders to address climate change.  The grassroots groups behind the Canadian marches have specific demands, including refusing any new oil and gas projects and cutting emissions to be just one quarter of what they were in 2005 by 2030.  ""As a collective of young people from across the country, we aim to steer Canadian society off our current path of ecological and social catastrophe,"" says the mandate of Climate Strike Canada, one of the groups spearheading the marches. ""Drastic climate action is the only option for humanity.""  Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish activist who has helped spur the global climate protest movement, ​​​​appeared in Montreal and encouraged thousands of Canadians to take to the streets today.  ""The strikes have been very successful today,"" Thunberg said in Montreal.  ""It is a very good day, I will say.""    Thunberg began weekly sit-ins outside the Swedish legislature last year, which over the course of a few months grew into a global phenomenon. One week ago, millions of people around the world marched in protest against governments not taking drastic climate action. Another day of global protest took place Friday, including in more than 85 cities and towns in Canada.  From St. John's to Vancouver, and as far north as Inuvik in the Northwest Territories, tens of thousands of Canadians came out in force. They came in strollers and on skateboards, on bikes and in army boots, wearing knee braces and leaning on crutches and canes. From babies to baby boomers, grandkids to grandparents, they filled parks and the lawns of legislatures and Parliament, toting papier mâché Earths and trees, some with full potted plants on their backs.  Watch: Timelapse of Montreal's climate march    Their message was clear: bolder action is urgently needed to save the planet from the crisis of climate change.  In Halifax, several thousand people marched through the streets and ended their protest at the headquarters of Nova Scotia Power. In Toronto, thousands more filled the front lawn of the provincial legislature and the streets around it.  In Ottawa, the crowd size exceeded most Canada Day celebrations, filling the streets for more than a dozen city blocks as the marchers wound their way through downtown from city hall to Parliament Hill. Some added a truly Canadian flavour by putting their placards on hockey sticks and insisting their chants be delivered in both official languages.    Many of those who came out called Thunberg their inspiration.  ""I think she has revolutionized how we look at activism,"" said Pascal Morimanno, a 17-year-old marching in Fredericton. ""She is one person but there are millions of youth out here now because of her. She is the face of new activism.""  ""This movement has been built around children fighting for their future,"" added Roy Bateman, a 13-year-old marching in Toronto. ""[We're] also fighting for those who are less fortunate and also those who will be more harshly affected by climate change.""  He said politicians could address climate change but are making the wrong choices.  ""It's a matter of priorities,"" he said.  Watch: Thunberg addresses her critics    Thousands of protesters in Vancouver reached the final destination in their three kilometre march from city hall, plugging West Georgia Street in the city's downtown.  Among them were the five children of the Duprat family of nearby Lions Bay, who brought their parents to the rally.  ""It hurts me because I've only lived on this Earth for so little time and I don't want to end it that quick,"" said Nalia, 11.  Betty Kidanewold, 14, travelled with friends from the Vancouver suburb of Surrey to join the march, saying they're tired of seeing world leaders deny climate change on TV or fail to act with urgency.  ""If we're going to take a stand, it's got to be now,"" she said.    Not everyone in Canada backed the events. In the Alberta capital, several thousand people protested on the lawn of the provincial legislature, but were measured in criticizing things like the Trans Mountain oil pipeline.  Paula Camacho, a 25-year-old student at The King's University in Edmonton, said she didn't have a particular stance on expanding the pipeline, but added that other energy sources are also needed.  ""I know there are so many people who depend (on oil) job-wise,"" Camacho said. ""But I think it's good to have these conversations and talk about something that is more sustainable for everybody.""  Inside the legislature, some people put posters in their windows saying they loved Canadian oil and gas.    Coming as it has in the midst of Canada's federal election campaign, many candidates and four of the six mainstream party leaders joined events in their cities Friday. Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau, Green Leader Elizabeth May, and Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet all marched in Montreal, while NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh marched in Victoria.  Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said there would be Conservative representation at the Montreal march, but he was not personally attending any events. In fact, he flew over many of them Friday as he made his way on his campaign plane from Montreal to Vancouver for an announcement in Coquitlam, B.C.   Bernier, the only national party leader to deny climate change is a crisis caused by human activity, is campaigning in his home riding of Beauce in Quebec.    Trudeau marched with his wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, and two of their three children, Xavier, 11, and Ella-Grace, 10, as well as several Quebec candidates. He was met with some cheers and some hostility. Several protesters shouted at him that he was a hypocrite because he is promising climate action but expanding a pipeline to extract more oil from Alberta.  One protester attempted to throw an egg at Trudeau but was promptly wrestled to the ground by his security detail. Xavier appeared visibly upset, and Trudeau stopped to comfort him for a few moments.  Trudeau heckled  Jaggi Singh, one of Canada's best-known anti-globalization activists and a self-proclaimed anarchist, followed Trudeau along the march route, yelling at him for buying the Trans Mountain pipeline.  ""As a man born in blackface, I denounce you,"" Singh shouted at Trudeau, referencing the recent revelation that Trudeau put on blackface makeup several times when he was younger.  Trudeau smiled and waved through most of the event, shouting, ""Thank you for being here"" at those who decried him, while his supporters around him chanted in French, ""Moving forward for the planet.""  Watch: New Brunswick marchers speak out    Earlier Friday, Trudeau sat down with Thunberg for a private meeting. Trudeau's quest for re-election next month depends heavily on convincing Canadians that his party's climate plan is enough to do Canada's part for the planet; his rivals on the left argue the Trans Mountain deal undermines any climate action he is taking. Thunberg said she told Trudeau the same thing she tells all world leaders.  ""Just listen to the science,"" she said.  Marches already took place earlier Friday in dozens of countries around the world including in India, the Netherlands and Italy. Thunberg said she believes 60,000 people took part in marches in her home country of Sweden, while 300,000 marched in New Zealand, more than three per cent of the country's entire population.",technology
301,'We don't want to be the next cancer village': Canada's plastic recycling dumped and burned overseas,"Fumes spewed from the machinery as workers — wearing only T-shirts, sandals and no masks — at a recycling factory in northern Malaysia manually sorted through mountains of plastic scrap.  The workers, mainly from Bangladesh, earned around $12 a day, sometimes toiling seven days a week.  The labour was ""very cheap,"" said one businessman, as he gave a tour to undercover CBC Marketplace journalists posing as plastics brokers from a fake Canadian company.  The factory was willing to buy the dirty plastic being offered — and said they would break the country's strict importing laws to do it, advising the journalists to lie on the shipping container labels.  ""We can start trying with two to four [shipping] containers and see,"" said the manager.  ""If the [Malaysian] government knew, they would shut it down? Illegal?"" asked one of the CBC journalists.  ""Yeah,"" replied one of the factory's business partners.    Canadians have long been taught to sort and recycle their plastic, dropping it in the blue box with the thought that it will be transformed into something new.  But an undercover Marketplace investigation uncovered huge piles of Canadian plastic dumped and burned overseas in Malaysian landfills, polluting rivers and sometimes creating toxic byproducts that people say are making them sick.     Marketplace hid trackers in Canadian recycling to find out where our plastic really ends up. Tune in at 8 p.m. Friday to see the results on CBC-TV or online.    ""I think [Canadians] will be highly disturbed… to see what actually happens to their recycling,"" said Myra Hird, an expert on waste management from Queen's University.  ""I don't think Canadians want this at all. I think Canadians would be highly shocked,"" she said. ""They should be, by realizing what is actually happening to the stuff that they're so diligently washing and cleaning and organizing into those bins.""  A fake company, lawbreaking recyclers  The global recycling industry has been under intense scrutiny in recent years. At the beginning of 2018, China stopped taking in much of the world's recycling, leaving an entire industry scrambling for new markets.  Businesses turned their attention to southeast Asia: Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand — and eventually Malaysia, which, at one point, became the world's biggest importer of plastic scrap.  Canada alone exported more than 10,000 tonnes of plastic scrap to Malaysia in 2018.  As a result of this shift, illegal and unlicensed factories have popped up en masse.  Marketplace went undercover in Malaysia to investigate the plastic industry. Here's what we learned:    Marketplace wanted to know how easy it was to get recyclable Canadian goods overseas into countries with heavy restrictions on importing post-consumer plastics, like Malaysia.  So the team posed as a fake company called MarketPlastics, and then, using shipping records, reached out to several Malaysian companies believed to be importing Canadian plastic.  MarketPlastics was pitched as a plastics broker looking to find new end markets for a glut of Canadian plastics it needed to unload. The meetings were largely set up in northern Malaysia, the current epicentre of recycling after a government crackdown in another region of the country.  'We don't want to be the next cancer village'  When Marketplace journalists arrived in Malaysia, the environmental toll to which Canadian recycling has contributed was on full display: A towering dump of plastic waste, burning, and runoff from factories streaming into rivers used by the local population.  At one location, in Ipoh, the waste was stacked two storeys high and spanned about the length of two football fields. Large pools of chemicals had formed, cascading down from the top of the heap. It was one of the many dumps in the country — this one full of Western plastic from around the world: England, United States, Denmark and Canada.    Further south, at a factory that had been shut down following a government raid, Marketplace discovered mountains of soft film plastic from major Canadian brands: Loblaws, Canadian Tire, even a grocery bag from a retailer in Langley, B.C.  ""I think this is not called [recycling], they ... polluted the environment,"" said Lydia Ong, a former Malaysian politician turned environmental activist.    Ong has been an outspoken critic of her country's rapidly growing recycling industry and the West's appetite to send its plastic overseas. ""I've been telling the government that … we don't want to be [an] international rubbish bin,"" she said.  Ong took Marketplace to a forest-turned-wasteland, where the air was noticeably acrid and plastic bits were scattered among the piles of ash. According to Ong, unscrupulous recyclers had taken 200 tonnes of unwanted plastic and burned it there.  ""So the factory … they dump all the waste that they cannot recycle anymore. Or they don't use anymore. Or low value. They dump [it] here,"" she said.    Ong said she's concerned about the health impacts illegal factories and their actions are having on the population in northern Malaysia. When plastic burns, it releases harmful and potentially carcinogenic chemicals known to harm human health. It can also have devastating effects on the environment.  ""We don't want to be the next cancer village,"" she said.  Marketplace was also taken to Sungai Petani, which sits next to two major rivers and has experienced heavy industrialization in recent years. People were fishing there and the water is used to irrigate farms in the area. But the water was also noticeably discoloured, filled with millions of floating plastics bits.    Local resident Evon Chee said she and her family have been exposed to daily burning in the region over the past year, as more factories continue to pop up.  Her son has been getting coughs and fevers, and she often has to keep him inside. She said she's scared it could become more serious.  ""My son is always getting sick,"" said Chee.  She has a message for Canadians: Don't send your rubbish here.  'We will not become a dumping ground'  The Malaysian government says it has shut down close to 150 factories. It also heavily restricted the import of plastics — only 62 companies are officially allowed to bring it into the country. But Canadian shipments continue to pour in.  ""It's a huge problem for us,"" said Yeo Bee Yin, Malaysia's minister of energy, science, technology, environment and climate change.    ""We have been receiving many garbage [loads] from developed countries.… The amount of it that came into Malaysia was just so huge that it actually impacts the environment,"" said Yin. ""It is actually very shocking when you see that, and I feel very angry.""  In June, authorities seized thousands of tonnes of Canadian plastic that arrived at a northern Malaysian port, according to local news reports. The containers were said to be lined with plastic in the front — but full of waste at the back.    In May, Marketplace producers were on the ground in Malaysia when the authorities found a shipping container filled with plastic bags and packaging from several well-known Canadian brands during a raid at Port Klang, near the country's capital, Kuala Lumpur.  Yin and her ministry have been trying to return the container to Canada, saying they could escalate the matter and take their concerns to the international community if the Malaysian company that imported the waste cannot be forced to ship it back.  ""We will not become a dumping ground and I will do the best I can to make sure that I will dump back your garbage to your own country,"" said Yin.    A spokesperson from the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change told Marketplace it was aware of ""two potentially non-compliant shipments of plastic waste from Canada to Malaysia,"" and that it was ""working closely with the Malaysian government to resolve any outstanding issues.""  Companies in Malaysia caught dumping and burning plastic could face fines, have their factories shut down or potentially be slapped with jail time. Other indiscretions, like tampering with import permits, can see those permits — or even a business licence — revoked.  But with the business of buying plastic being so lucrative, some companies had no problem breaking the law. In one instance observed by Marketplace, the CEO of a major Malaysian recycler said he gets paid a ""little bit"" — a reference to kickbacks — when helping other companies that aren't allowed to import the materials.  Canada won't ban exports  While Australia recently has vowed to ban the export of recyclable waste, Canada has not committed to going that far.  Instead, a spokesperson from the Ministry of Environment and Climate change told Marketplace it plans to heavily restrict the export of plastic through an international treaty, known as the Basel Convention, as of 2021.    It also is ""looking at what else our government can do to reduce the amount of Canadian garbage that is ending up overseas,"" the spokesperson said.  As for Hird, she says Canadians need to start demanding action from their government, as well as start keeping better track of their own garbage.  ""We're very, very clearly not taking the high moral ground here at all,"" she said. ""We are setting a horrible example for other countries around the world.""  ",technology
302,How 'organized climate change denial' shapes public opinion on global warming,"With citizens around the world filling the streets demanding climate action, it might appear that the voices of contrarians are growing fainter. But doubts about climate change still surface.  Just this week, Maxime Bernier, leader of the People's Party of Canada, told the Toronto Star's editorial board that ""while the climate may be changing, this is not due primarily to human activity.""  In the U.S., climate contrarians hold key political positions.  ""We have the president of the United States basically enunciating climate denier talking points, so it's still alive and well,"" said Robert Brulle, a professor at Brown University in Providence, R.I., who has spent years researching climate contrarians.  John Cook at the Center for Climate Change Communication at George Mason University recently completed a study tracking climate misinformation in internet articles. He discovered an increase in rhetoric denying that warming is happening — but he also saw evidence of an uptick in misinformation about climate change solutions over the last few years.  Other climate communication researchers say they've noticed a similar trend.   ""In some ways, the face of climate denial in political rhetoric has shifted,"" said Matto Mildenberger, a Canadian climate policy researcher currently working at the University of California, Santa Barbara.  ""It tends to be much more either, 'We can't do anything about it' or 'It's not important enough to do right away.'""  The researchers have also found evidence that climate misinformation is affecting public opinion about the nature of climate change and the efficacy of solutions.   'Organized climate change denial'  The phenomenon of climate misinformation has been the focus of a growing field of research, which began when social scientists noticed an emerging anti-climate change narrative in response to scientific evidence of global warming.    The first assessment of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was released in 1990, and concluded that human activities were increasing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations that would warm the earth's surface.    The evidence and scientific consensus for climate change caused by human activities has accumulated since then. This week, a new IPCC Special Report described widespread melting of ice sheets and ocean warming and stressed the need for ""ambitious emissions reductions coupled with coordinated sustained and increasingly ambitious adaptation actions.""  Environmental sociologist Riley Dunlap, one of the early climate communication researchers, was intrigued in the '90s when he recognized a ""counter-movement"" to climate activism.  ""You get these almost always conservative counter-movements that emerge when the first movement is pushing society, with some success, in a progressive direction,"" said Dunlap.   In one paper, Dunlap identified the members of the movement as ""contrarian scientists, fossil fuels corporations, conservative think-tanks, and various front groups,"" along with ""a bevy of amateur climate bloggers and self-designated experts, public relations firms, astroturf groups, conservative media and pundits, and conservative politicians.""  Over the last three decades, a series of investigative news stories as well as academic research revealed additional evidence of what Dunlap called ""organized climate change denial.""   In 1991, a New York Times story described how a campaign by coal-burning utility companies and coal producers aimed ""to 'reposition global warming as theory' and not fact.""  In 1998, leaked documents from the American Petroleum Institute, a trade organization for the oil and gas industry, described its plan to boost uncertainty about climate change. Those documents, now published online by the Union of Concerned Scientists, describe a global communications action plan where ""victory will be achieved when … recognition of uncertainties [around climate science] becomes part of the 'conventional wisdom.'""  ""The conservative movementu002Ffossil fuel complex quickly adopted the strategy of 'manufacturing' uncertainty and doubt (perfected by the tobacco industry) as its preferred strategy for promoting skepticism,"" Dunlap wrote.    ""I think it's important that the public understand that there are these powerful economic actors that have been working very hard to distort what the public thinks about this,"" said Mildenberger.   ""This is a beast, or a demon, that's been unleashed by the fossil fuel industry that's taken on a bit of a life of its own.""  Denial creates 'wait-and-see attitude'  Mildenberger said current climate misinformation has evolved. He said one tactic climate skeptics use is targeting climate activists for their personal carbon footprint, in an effort ""to discredit [those] who are trying to make reforms by accusing them of hypocrisy.""  Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, said some of these skeptics use ""Chicken Little catastrophic arguments,"" such as ""maybe we ought to do something but we don't want to destroy the economy and cause millions of jobs and send the entire world into a great depression.""    Leiserowitz calls these people climate policy ""delayers.""  ""They've always been sophisticated, arguing there's large-scale uncertainty, that we don't need to act drastically, and that we need to look at this very carefully — and if there's a need to act, we can do it through innovation and non-regulatory things,"" said Brulle.  ""This is 21st-century mass marketing and public relations technology being applied to this issue.""  In a recent paper, Cook organized climate misinformation into five categories: ""it's not real, it's not us, it's not bad, the experts are unreliable and climate solutions won't work.""  The goal ""is to slow-walk transitions away from fossil fuel,"" he said.    Research suggests exposure to misinformation is affecting the way people view  climate, polarizing debate and seeding doubt about the wisdom of switching to a low-carbon economy.  ""What we show in our work is that it's basically holding people back. It's keeping them in a wait-and-see attitude,"" said Leiserowitz.   Cook said his own research suggests that ""when people are presented with facts and myths, and they don't know how to tell the difference between the two, they end up not changing their beliefs either way. They end up cancelling each other out.""    Mildenberger worked with researchers at the University of Montreal to develop an interactive map of Canadian attitudes toward climate change based on peer-reviewed modelling that estimates climate beliefs on a riding by riding basis, providing what Mildenberger described as a ""granular understanding"" of Canadian climate beliefs.  ""The places in Canada that have lower belief in climate change are primarily in rural Alberta and Saskatchewan,"" he said, adding that these are also regions heavily dominated by the oil and gas industry.  ""You get this real sense that the impacts of climate misinformation, and the way they're politically relevant, may matter more in a very small group of ridings.""  Media's role  The climate communication researchers have identified media coverage as one factor that has amplified the climate denial movement. Specifically, the journalistic reflex to provide two opposing sides on any story.  ""You would have a climate scientist on a cable news show or a panel debating climate policy, and the media would find someone who disbelieved [it] or was from an industry group that was rejecting the climate consensus,"" said Mildenberger. ""It gives [the public] a false sense that there was real substantial scientific debate about this.""  Cook said that this sort of coverage of climate change ""really was the way in which most people were introduced to the climate issue over the last 15 years, and so the public is understandably very confused as a result.""  Cook has tested different ways to neutralize misinformation and discovered that people can be ""inoculated"" against it.  In one study, he compared the effect of climate misinformation on two groups of people using a sample of what he called the ""fake expert strategy.""    One group was shown a petition signed by thousands of ""scientists"" — even though most of them were not climate experts — who said humans have not caused global warming.   A second group was also shown the petition, but the difference is that before seeing it, they were told about the misinformation tactic of using ""spokespeople who convey the impression of expertise without possessing any relevant scientific expertise.""   Cook said by boosting critical thinking, he was able to minimize the effect of the misinformation in the second group. And he said it worked regardless of political affiliation.  ""Whether the people were liberal or conservative, it neutralized the misinformation. What that tells me is that regardless of your political ideology, no one wants to be misled.""",technology
303,"Greta Thunberg meets Trudeau, tells him he's not doing enough to fight climate change","Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg told Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau today he's not doing enough to protect the environment from the threat of runaway climate change.  Trudeau met the teenage activist ahead of Friday's mass climate rally in Montreal in his capacity as prime minister. The pair spoke in private for about 15 minutes, shortly before Trudeau joined the rally marching through the city's downtown.  After the meeting, Thunberg was asked if she had a message for Trudeau. She said that Trudeau is not doing enough — but added that she says the same thing to every political leader she meets.  ""My message to all the politicians around the world is the same: just listen and act on the current, best available united science,"" she said.  ""I try not to focus on the individuals and rather focus on the whole picture because ... of course it's easier to just blame someone and of course he has a lot of responsibility ... and he, of course, is not doing enough.  ""But we need to, because this is such a huge problem. This is a system that is wrong. So my message to all the politicians is the same — to just listen to the science and act on the science.""    In a news conference announcing a proposal to plant trees to combat climate change, Trudeau called Thunberg a ""remarkable"" young person who is driving the conversation forward.  ""She is the voice of a generation of young people who are calling on their leaders to do more and to do better, and I'm listening,"" he said.  'This is shameful'  Trudeau was asked about a June 19 tweet from Thunberg in which she questioned Canada's decision to declare a climate emergency one day and say yes to expanding the Trans Mountain pipeline the next.  ""This is shameful. But of course this is not only in Canada, we can unfortunately see the same pattern everywhere,"" she said.    Trudeau defended his government's actions.  ""We have a national climate plan that will reduce our emissions and hit our 2030 targets in a way that also includes getting a better price for our oil resources that allows us to put the profits directly into the fight against climate change,"" he said.  Trudeau had a large security detail surrounding him and his family as they joined the crowds on the streets of Montreal for the climate rally. Some in the crowd chanted slogans attacking Trudeau's embrace of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion.  At one point, RCMP tackled to the ground a protester who was carrying eggs.    As millions of young people around the world took to the streets today to call for urgent action on climate change, the Liberal leader promised to plant two billion trees if his government is re-elected.    Trudeau said the initiative would use the power of nature to fight climate change, help cities expand and diversify urban forests, better protect trees from infestation and help rebuild forests after wildfires.  The program would support an estimated 3,500 seasonal jobs in tree planting, according to the Liberal Party.  $3 billion climate fund promised  The tree planting initiative would be part of a broader $3 billion, 10-year fund to support efforts across the country to better manage, conserve, and restore forests, grasslands, agricultural lands, wetlands and coastal areas that help store and take carbon pollution out of the air.  According to Liberal Party background documents, the initiative would be an annual investment of $300 million, starting in 2020-21, with costs offset by revenues from the Trans Mountain pipeline.  Further details related to costing will be released over the course of the campaign, the party claims.    Green Party Leader Elizabeth May also attended the Montreal rally, while NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is taking part in a climate rally in Victoria later today.  Trudeau took the opportunity to attack Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer for skipping the rally. Scheer was travelling to B.C. this morning for several campaign events.  ""Andrew Scheer is choosing to hide today instead of participating in climate marches,"" he said. ""But it's no surprise he's not showing up for the climate march because he's not showing up for the fight against climate change.""  'Interesting and ironic'  At a campaign event in Coquitlam, B.C. later in the day, Scheer suggested Trudeau is hypocritical for taking part in the march.  ""I find it interesting and ironic that Justin Trudeau is actively protesting his own government's record on the environment,"" he said.    ""He'll be marching today with so many people who realize that his plan is not as advertised. It will lead to higher costs of living while not achieving our targets.""  Singh, meanwhile, criticized Trudeau for saying he's taking on climate change while promoting the oil sector.  Pipeline politics  ""Mr. Trudeau promised really clearly in 2015 that he would not build the Trans Mountain, that he would oppose it. And then once he got into office, not only did he break that promise, he bought the pipeline then approved its expansion the day after he declared a climate emergency,"" he said.  ""That is something that should have everyone pause, and that's why Canadians are saying we can't trust and we don't believe Mr. Trudeau.""    In an interview with CBC Montreal's Daybreak Friday, May said voters need to elect a party that is up to the challenge and ready with a concrete plan to reduce emissions and create jobs in the growing green economy.  ""We want to ensure that in this election, which I think is really a referendum on climate change, voters recognize that, if you really want to see a green policy, you've got to vote for a party that is really going to hold the line and ensure that we don't go above 1.5 degrees Celsius,"" she said.     Joining Thunberg at the rally earlier today was Assembly of First Nations National Chief Perry Bellegarde, who praised her for her leadership.  ""You don't have to be elected to be a leader. You are leading,"" he said.  While Thunberg has been praised for her efforts by many world leaders, she's also come in for some pointed criticism from politicians on the right, including U.S. President Donald Trump and People's Party of Canada Leader Maxime Bernier.  Bernier has described Thunberg on Twitter as ""clearly mentally unstable"" and suggested her climate activism is spreading irrational fears about the environment.  Trump tried to throw shade on Thunberg following her impassioned speech to the United Nations earlier this week, describing the activist as a ""happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future."" In response, Thunberg trolled Trump by sarcastically adding Trump's description of her to her Twitter profile.  'People want to silence us'  Today, Thunberg suggested these politicians are attacking her out of fear.  ""I don't understand why grownups would choose to mock children and teenagers for just communicating and acting on the science when they could do something good instead,"" she said.  ""I guess they must feel like their world view or their interests, or whatever it is, is threatened by us. And we should take as a compliment that we are having so much impact that people want to silence us.""  During their earlier meeting, Trudeau asked Thunberg what her friends back home thought about the march. She told the Liberal leader there will be about 60,000 people marching in Stockholm today.  ""A few more than that today,"" Trudeau responded.  Thunberg said she was pleased with the size of the crowd in Montreal.  Addressing the crowd today, Thunberg said she did not have a prepared speech but she was thrilled to be among people gathered for ""a common cause.""",technology
304,UN protocol used by youths in climate complaint not available to Canadian kids,"A children's rights advocate is urging Canada to adopt a United Nations protocol that 16 youths, including Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, are using to push for climate action.  Sara Austin, founder and CEO of Children First Canada, led the years-long global push for a UN code for children — and their adult representatives — to file complaints if their rights have been violated.  The UN General Assembly adopted the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child for a Communications Procedure in 2011 and it came into force in 2014.  ""It really is remarkable to me now to see young people like Greta and 15 of her peers now using this law to file a complaint against five governments and to seek justice for the failure of their government to protect their safe and healthy childhood,"" Austin, who is based in Calgary, said in an interview.    The complaint this month from the child petitioners — who are between eight and 17-years old and represent 12 countries — is directed at five of the 45 countries that have ratified the protocol: Argentina, France, Germany, Brazil and Turkey. It alleges those countries violate children's rights by failing to address the climate crisis.  ""This law is not yet available for kids here in Canada to file a complaint because our government hasn't ratified it, but we hope to see that change,"" Austin said.  ""As a Canadian who was leading these global efforts, I was dismayed and deeply frustrated that my own government was opposed to the law and to this day has not yet ratified it.""  Austin said her efforts were motivated by children's rights violations she witnessed through her work in Asia, Africa and Latin America. She recalled spending three years in Thailand, where she encountered kids who were victims of child labour and trafficking. Many were not getting adequate health care for AIDS and other diseases.  ""It was kids like that who motivated me to really find ways to give them a voice and seek timely justice when their rights were being denied.""  Greta, 16, has inspired climate strikes in more than 150 countries, including several planned Friday across Canada.    ",technology
305,Thousands flood city streets in 2nd wave of global climate protests,"Thousands of people flooded city streets on Friday in a second wave of worldwide protests demanding swift action on climate change.  New Zealand kicked off the global strike with tens of thousands marching to Parliament in the country's capital of Wellington. It was one of the largest protests ever held there, and organizers needed to change their security plans to accommodate the swelling crowds.  Thousands more marched in Auckland and other parts of the country.  The protests are inspired by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg, who gave an emotionally charged speech at the climate summit at the United Nations General Assembly on Monday in New York City.    New Zealand and a number of other countries focused their protest efforts on the second wave, bookending a week in which climate change was at the forefront of the global conversation.  Thunberg attended a protest in Montreal.    In Wellington, 18-year-old university student Katherine Rivers said it was great to see young people taking action and personal responsibility by marching.  ""We need to stop pandering to some of the people who are making money off climate change. The big oil companies, the dairy industry etc.,"" she said. ""And make a change for the future of these kids that are here.""  Rivers, who is studying marine biology and environmental studies, said she hopes to make her career about improving the environment, and ""hopefully I get to have a career.""    While thousands of high school students elected to take time off school to protest, parents, office workers and many other adults joined the marches. One of them was 83-year-old Violet McIntosh, who has three grandchildren.  ""It's not my future we're thinking about,"" McIntosh said.  She said it was time politicians stopped talking and started taking action. She said they should listen to the young people like Thunberg, who she described as ""amazing.  ""She stood out there by herself to start it all. Millions of people are following her now,"" McIntosh said. ""She should be very proud of herself.""    A global movement  Meanwhile in Europe, thousands of students took to the streets of Rome on Friday, with protesters gathering at a central square in the Italian capital.    The demonstration had record attendance due to an initiative of the Italian education ministry, which meant students attending the march would not be considered absent from school.  ""The real problem is not what are the solutions, because there are solutions. The problem is making people aware, because not everybody understands this is a real crisis,"" said university student Sara Brunori.    In France, climate activists staged a peaceful protest in Paris at the Louvre Museum, the world's largest art gallery, to mark its glass pyramid with hands dipped in molasses. The protest calls out the Louvre's partnership with French oil giant Total, one of the seven ""super major"" oil companies in the world, which also includes BP, Shell and Chevron.   ""We don't believe that a cultural institution, an international institution, should be receiving money from a multinational company that continues to endanger the climate, to pollute the climate and leave such a dirty environmental footprint on the earth,"" one activist said.   In Berlin, activists from the Fridays for Future group braved persistent rain to denounce a package of measures that the German government recently agreed on to cut the country's greenhouse gas emissions. Experts say the proposal falls far short of what's needed if the world's sixth-biggest emitter is to meet the goals of the landmark 2015 Paris climate accord.  Actor Javier Bardem joined dozens of young people in San Sebastian in one of several demonstrations and rallies held across Spain on Friday morning ahead of evening demonstrations in the major cities where big crowds are expected, especially in Madrid and Barcelona. Bardem was promoting a documentary he worked on with Greenpeace.  In Austria, organizers said 150,000 people participated, while local APA news agency said the number was 65,000.  'There is no Planet B'  Friday's protests follow mass demonstrations on Sept. 20, when millions of young people flooded streets around the world to demand political leaders take urgent steps to stop climate change.  ""There is no Planet B,"" read a sign hoisted by a young woman in London on Friday.    Alarmed by images of Greenland ice sheets melting and the Amazon rainforests burning, students and workers abandoned schools, shops and offices in nearly every corner of the globe, aiming to stop what they see as a looming environmental catastrophe.  The protests started in the Pacific islands, where rising sea levels threaten a way of life, and followed the sun across Australia, Japan, Southeast Asia and on to Europe, Africa, the Middle East and the Americas. The co-ordinated student ""strike"" culminated in New York's Wall Street, where some investors have embraced the fossil fuel industry.  Massive crowds overwhelmed the streets of lower Manhattan, chanting, ""Save our planet!""  ""Right now we are the ones who are making a difference. If no one else will take action, then we will,"" Thunberg told tens of thousands of people at a park with a view of the Statue of Liberty.  ""If you belong to that small group of people who feel threatened by us, then we have some very bad news for you. Because this is only the beginning. Change is coming whether they like it or not.""  Demonstrators in Paris raised a painting of Thunberg as the Virgin Mary, a halo around her head reading, ""Our house is on fire.""    Thousands gathered across Brazil to take aim at Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro, who they say is allowing the destruction of the Amazon rainforest to clear space for soy beans and cattle ranching. In August, fires there surged to their greatest level since 2010.  ""The policy of the Bolsonaro government is the policy of environmental destruction and deepening the climate crisis ... this is why we're on strike,"" said Marcela Pimentel Miranda, an organizer for Youth for Climate's affiliate in Brasilia.    Demonstrators in Thailand stormed the Environment Ministry and feigned death, while activists in Berlin and Munich stood on melting blocks of ice with nooses around their necks to symbolize the Earth's fate when the polar ice caps melt.  Protesters in Warsaw staged a performance of people drowning in a sea of plastic waste.  While Europeans filled the streets, students in the Solomon Islands gathered at the rising ocean water's edge wearing traditional grass skirts. The issue is vital to low-lying Pacific islands, which have repeatedly asked wealthier nations to do more to prevent rising sea levels.  Organizers estimate four million people participated worldwide including 300,000 in New York, organizers with the anti-fossil fuels group 350.org said. ",technology
306,"From abandoning coal to saving forests, the big pledges from the UN climate summit","Hello, people! This is our weekly newsletter on all things environmental, where we highlight trends and solutions that are moving us to a more sustainable world. (Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Thursday.)  This week:     The big takeaways from a week of climate action   The cheapest energy sources, by country   Trash talk: The truth about biodegradable bags      The big takeaways from a week of climate action    The United Nations Climate Action Summit this past week featured a lot of drama and intrigue, from Greta Thunberg's pithy speech to U.S. President Donald Trump's 10-minute drop-in appearance to climate strikes, which are set to escalate again on Friday.  Some observers expressed disappointment at the lack of bold plans from individual countries in reducing carbon emissions. But there were pledges made on the margins, as cities, civil groups, companies, banks and pension funds announced their own initiatives to meet the targets laid out in the Paris Agreement to limit global warming this century to 1.5 C.  All talk? Maybe. Here are some of the announcements that could make a difference.  More ambitious country targets  Finland has committed to achieving carbon neutrality (that is, offsetting all its emissions) by 2033 and aims to be the first industrial economy to go carbon negative (sucking up more carbon than it emits). It's pushing other EU countries to follow suit. Sixty-six countries have promised to make their climate goals more ambitious and 30 swore to be carbon-neutral by mid-century.  Abandoning coal  Canada and Great Britain lead the Powering Past Coal Alliance, which includes countries, states or regions and corporations committed to ending the building of coal plants by 2020, and picking up the pace of transition to renewables. This week, Germany, the largest user of coal in Europe, and Slovakia joined the alliance. This list tracks all the companies that have committed to divesting from coal financing.  Companies buy in  A group of 87 major companies in 27 countries — including The Co-operative Group, IKEA, Danone, L'Oréal and Nestlé — say they will set climate targets for their entire value chain in line with the Paris targets. According to the UN, these companies have combined annual direct emissions equivalent to 73 coal-fired power plants.  Responsible investing  The Asset Owner Alliance, a self-styled group of pension funds and insurers with more than $2 trillion US in investments, committed to carbon-neutral investment portfolios by 2050 in hopes of spurring others to make similar moves. The group includes Zurich Insurance, German insurer Allianz and La Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec.  Committing to nature  The Global Campaign for Nature aims to conserve 30 per cent of the Earth's lands and oceans by 2030. Central American countries are collaborating to restore 10 million hectares and Central African states set goals to preserve and restore their rainforest.  Saving the rainforest  International donors pledged $500 million US to protect the rainforest, including the Amazon, which suffered record fire damage this year. France, Chile and Colombia met on the sidelines of the UN gathering, pledging to stop deforestation and restore degraded forests. (Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a climate change skeptic, did not participate.)  Help for developing countries  French President Emmanuel Macron has the backing of European countries for the Green Climate Fund, which helps poorer countries with climate issues. With the U.S. having pulled out, Macron urged other countries to step up to bring the fund to $10 billion. A group of 24 national and regional banks that work in developing countries is putting together financing to make poor countries more resilient, aiming to have $1 trillion to invest by 2025.  A call for 'climate disclosure'  Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, told the UN that climate issues must be at the heart of financial decision-making. He called for mandatory disclosure of climate impact and climate risk management by corporations. The U.K., Canada and the EU are already moving toward such disclosure, but Carney says it must be universal.  — Susan Noakes    Reader feedback  Last Friday, an estimated four million people worldwide marched for climate action. This Friday, environmental demonstrators will do it again, with a large contingent expected in Canadian cities. Here's what What on Earth? readers are doing:  Debra Hayes said she booked off work on Friday to attend the climate strike event in Toronto. Elizabeth Robinson said she will be marching in Montreal as part of La planète s'invite en santé, a group made up of Quebec health workers.  Jane Caswell, who lives in Edmonton, said she took the last few weeks off work ""to avidly participate in and watch the global events unfold."" Caswell added that she has had a ""Sept. 27th climate strike protest sign made for a couple of weeks.""   Karl Maier wrote in to say he, too, would be striking on Friday. He added the demonstrations are ""a good way to send the message to our leaders, elected and otherwise, that 'business as usual' has ended. The climate is screaming in pain, let's answer with compassion and courage.""  Email us at whatonearth@cbc.ca.  Old issues of What on Earth? are right here.      The Big Picture: The cheapest forms of energy, by country  Transforming electrical grids worldwide is one of the biggest priorities in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Many countries have been reluctant to relinquish high-carbon sources such as coal and natural gas because for a long time, they have been the cheapest resource for creating power. But that's changing. The cost of installing wind turbines and solar panels has come way down — plus, wind and sun are free and plentiful. As a result, the cheapest energy source for many countries has changed drastically in the last five years, as the graph below shows. (Note: The graph is on a loop, so if you can't take it all in at first glance, it will change back.)    Hot and bothered: Provocative ideas from around the web      We hear a lot about the ability of trees to sequester carbon. But did you know that whales have a similar power? Scientists have estimated that when it comes to carbon capture, one whale is equivalent to 1,000 trees. Among other things, whale poop leads to the proliferation of phytoplankton, which are excellent vessels for storing carbon.     Consumers have become increasingly aware of the garment industry's exorbitant use of water, as well as its carbon emissions. The simplest way to reduce fashion's environmental footprint is to buy fewer, better clothes. This service feature from the New York Times explains how to buy higher-quality pieces, from scrutinizing the blend of materials to doing ""the tug test.""       Trash talk: The truth about biodegradable bags    Back in July, the City of Ottawa made a shift to allow its residents to put plastic bags in the compost bin. People noticed.   After the plastic bag bill passed, many people took to Twitter to voice their disapproval, calling it a ""stupid policy"" for ""the lazy,"" and ""idiotic at a time when in many jurisdictions, plastic bags are trying to be phased out.""  While it may seem odd to allow plastic bags in the green bin, many people find it makes the process of capturing household organic waste a little more tidy. Municipalities that allow it skim plastic bags off early in the disposal process.  Many jurisdictions actually encourage the use of biodegradable bags, and consumers buy them with the belief that they will decompose with the rest of the organic waste. But that isn't always true.   Even in the landfill, compostable plastics may not degrade, according to a study done by the University of Plymouth in the U.K. The study tested five types of commonly used plastic bags, including ones labelled ""compostable"" and ""biodegradable,"" to see how well they break down in different conditions. They tested the bags in both soil and sea, where they remained intact, exactly like regular plastic.  Tom Szaky, CEO of TerraCycle, a U.S. business that has gained a reputation for recycling the ""non-recyclable,"" has written about this. In his book Linear to Circular: The Future of Packaging, he writes that most consumers ""don't realize … that biodegradable bioplastics will break down only under the right conditions — those of a specific industrial composting facility.""  Szaky emphasized that ""even if that happens, [the bags] won't contribute value to the compost, unlike coffee grounds or leaves, which have a wide range of micro- and macronutrients as well as a living ecosystem of bacteria and other microbes.""  Even if they could create those perfect conditions, some municipalities have banned compostable plastics from green bins, including Toronto.   The City of Toronto website says:  ""There are many types of products that call themselves 'degradable.'  ""They may be degradable in the presence of certain components … and are made to degrade in a certain time period. This time period and conditions may not match the actual conditions in a processing facility.""  The Metro Vancouver solid waste site states that ""plastics, including those marked biodegradable, do not belong in the compost as they do not break down properly during processing.""  People who are confused or concerned about any kind of plastic have other options. Many municipalities suggest lining your bin with newspaper for an easier clean or simply not lining the bin at all. They also suggest washing out your bins regularly and putting them on the curb consistently, even when they're not full.   Or you could simply call your municipality's facility and ask what they accept.   — Taylor Logan    Stay in touch!  Are there issues you'd like us to cover? Questions you want answered?

307,'We are changing the world': Greta Thunberg addresses hundreds of thousands at Montreal climate march,"Hundreds of thousands of people thronged the streets of Montreal on Friday in a climate march that turned the city's downtown into a sea of placard-waving protesters.  To deafening cheers, Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg addressed the crowd at the end of the protest.  ""We are not in school today, you are not at work today, because this is an emergency, and we will not be bystanders,"" said the 16-year-old, whose activism has made headlines around the world.  ""Some would say we are wasting lesson time. We say we are changing the world. So that when we are older we will be able to look our children in the eyes and say that we did everything we could back then.""  Organizers said 500,000 people attended the march, making it the largest in the province's history.   Hours after protesters first gathered at the foot of Mount Royal in Montreal's Plateau district, at noon ET, the streets remained jammed with people.  Watch drone footage of the Montreal march:     Marches were also held around the world and elsewhere in Canada, including in Vancouver, Toronto, Ottawa and Quebec City.  The event comes in the middle of the federal election campaign in which the environment has emerged as a key issue.  Young activists — many not old enough to vote — demanded politicians adopt a climate action plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to zero by 2050.    Earlier Friday, Thunberg met with Indigenous youths ahead of the march, as well as with Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau.  She said afterward it was clear he hadn't done enough as prime minister.  ""My message to all the politicians is the same: to just listen to the science and act on the science.""  Inspiring students  The driving force behind the march was students, and classes at many high schools, colleges and universities were cancelled for the day.  Thunberg's presence in Montreal created even more interest in the march.  ""It's very inspirational of her to come here,"" said Maya Jonkov, who is the same age as Thunberg, and attended with several friends.  ""I think she's really going to show us that, yes, we need to take action about climate change.""    Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante, who has been outspoken about climate change and made public transit free for the day, gave Thunberg the keys to the city following the march.   Many Montreal businesses, unions and community organizations also closed so their employees could attend the demonstration.  ""Just know: every little thing we do counts, but the big things have to be done too,"" said Cedric Gray-Lehoux, a member of the First Nations of Quebec and Labrador Youth Network.  ""We have to make a drastic change. We have to change the system. We have to say that enough is enough.""  Culmination of yearlong series of strikes  Ben Clarkson, a spokesperson for La Planète s'invite au Parlement, said the Montreal gathering is the culmination of a yearlong series of climate strikes, which began in August 2018.   La Planète is one of the groups organizing Friday's climate march whose name translates as ""the planet goes to Parliament.""    More than 150 countries have participated in the #FridaysForFuture movement, launched by Thunberg.  Clarkson said Montreal's protest movement is particularly powerful, and he's hopeful it will lead, ultimately, to significant change.  ""We have a history of popular mobilization that the rest of Canada and maybe the rest of North America doesn't have here in Montreal,"" he said. ""That's been able to turn into and form into a very effective organizational group that has really grabbed onto this one day.""    Trudeau, Green Party Leader Elizabeth May and Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet all took part in Friday's march in Montreal.  The NDP's Jagmeet Singh was slated to attend a climate march in Victoria, while Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer did not plan to attend a march while campaigning in Vancouver.

308,"DoorDash data breach affects personal info of 4.9 million customers, merchants","Online food delivery service DoorDash says it's the victim of a data breach in which the personal information of 4.9 million people was stolen, including names, email addresses, delivery addresses, phone numbers, and partial banking and credit card details.  DoorDash, which allows people to order food from a website or smartphone to be delivered to them, said Thursday an ""unauthorized third party"" accessed some of the San Francisco-based company's user data on May 4.  As a result, information on customers, merchants and even some delivery drivers was stolen, including partial — but not complete — banking and credit card data, and driver's licence numbers for 100,000 delivery people.   The company said it has closed the access point the cybercriminals used, but the result is anyone who joined the service before April 5, 2018, is possibly impacted. Anyone who joined after that date is not.  Change passwords, DoorDash urges  DoorDash says it is in the process of contacting everyone affected, but as a precaution, it is encouraging all customers to change their passwords via a dedicated website.   The company operates in 4,000 cities, including 92 markets scattered across every Canadian province, so some Canadians are impacted.  But the company won't say how many, exactly.  ""The overall proportion of users affected represents a small percentage of our community,"" spokesperson Mattie Magdovitz told CBC News.  ""We remain wholly focused on our investigation and on doing the right thing for the DoorDash community, particularly those affected.""   ",technology
309,Europeans have a 'right to be forgotten' online. Should Canadians?,"Do Canadians have a ""right to be forgotten"" online that would allow them to make out-of-date or embarrassing information hard to find?  The short answer: it's complicated.  A European Union court decision this week with worldwide implications hasn't provided much clarity for Canadians. But more certainty could be on the way.  The European Court of Justice ruled on Tuesday that the EU's ""right to be forgotten"" legislation does not apply beyond its borders.  The law allows a citizen to ask Google to remove problematic or irrelevant web results that appear when their name is searched.  The corresponding web pages aren't deleted, but in many cases, the internet giant prevents them from appearing in its search results — a process known as de-listing or de-indexing.  Google says since the European law came into effect in 2014, it has received 845,501 such requests and removed 45 per cent of the 3.3 million links it was asked to take down.  The court said the EU doesn't have the tools to enforce de-listing on a global scale.    The new clarity on the limits of the EU law ""will send a signal to some countries, including Canada, about the prospect of creating their own right to be forgotten,"" said Michael Geist, a law professor at the University of Ottawa specializing in internet issues.  Canada does not have a formal, European-style rule for de-listing requests. Privacy Commissioner Daniel Therrien is seeking clarity from the Federal Court about whether Canada's Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act already provides a right-to-be-forgotten guarantee.  The commissioner's office says links to ""inaccurate, incomplete or outdated information"" should be taken down upon request. But it also says ""there is some uncertainty in the interpretation of the law,"" and that Google considers de-indexing in Canada to be ""unconstitutional.""  Pushback from Google  Google maintains that de-listing represents a slippery slope. In a statement to CBC, the company said ""removing lawful information from a search engine limits access to media properties, past decisions by public figures and information about many other topics.""    Peter Fleischer, Google's global privacy counsel, said freedom of expression is a ""broadly recognized — and passionately defended — right in Canada.""  ""We believe that every Canadian has the right to access lawful information.""  Canada's opposite take  The EU court case arose after the French privacy watchdog fined Google for refusing to de-index sites globally. The court's ruling means European authorities cannot, in fact, get search results removed abroad.  A 2017 Supreme Court of Canada decision came to the opposite conclusion. The top court upheld a B.C. ruling that instructed Google to remove certain search results worldwide — not just in Canada — as requested by the tech firm Equustek Solutions.  Sunny Handa, a Montreal-based partner at the law firm Blakes, said if a similar case were to come before the Supreme Court again, it could rule differently. He called the EU court's decision ""a step in the evolution of the issues.""  Though the ruling only applies to the EU's 28 member states, Canadian legal observers have been poring over it for a hint of things to come, and whether it could signal a global change in attitudes.  The Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada says it's reviewing the decision, too.    Eloïse Gratton, a lawyer who focuses on privacy and data protection, said the French case could have an influence on Canadian courts.  ""Perhaps courts will say there's no trend to follow"" in pushing for de-listing results abroad, said Gratton, a partner with the law firm Borden Ladner Gervais.  Fearing a court could potentially order ""politically or religiously sensitive material"" be removed, Gratton says she's ""not a big fan of the right to be forgotten.""  But it seems many Canadians do like the idea.  An Angus Reid Institute survey last year found 51 per cent of Canadian adults were in favour of a right to be forgotten online and to have search results changed. Only 23 per cent said erasing negative information ""means erasing history and facts.""  'Canadians need better tools'  The Office of the Privacy Commissioner (OPC) released its draft position on ""online reputation"" last year. It argues that requests for de-indexing search results already fall under the jurisdiction of existing privacy legislation. But OPC spokesperson Vito Pilieci said the office is holding off on finalizing its position as it awaits clarification from the Federal Court in a reference case.    ""It is clear that Canadians need better tools to help them to protect their online reputation,"" he said.  The reference case will take some time to be settled.  Geist, the law professor, said the case is still focused on procedural questions, rather than the crux of whether Canadians should have a right to be forgotten online.  For now, he said it's still not clear in Canada whether a search engine would have a legal obligation to remove links upon request.   ""I'm not convinced we have a right to be forgotten.""

310,Radar installed to watch huge Mont Blanc glacier that threatens to collapse,"A radar system has been installed to better monitor a fast-moving glacier on the Italian side of the Mont Blanc massif that risks having a large section break off into a tourist valley.  The radar system installed Thursday on the Planpincieux glacier provides constant data on movements of ice even at the sub-millimetre level. That compares with the satellite photo monitoring already in place, which requires clear skies and takes between six to 12 days to get comparative images.  The mayor of the Italian town of Courmayeur, Stevano Miserocchi, has closed a mountain road and blocked access to nearby areas due to the risk that a 250,000-cubic-metre mass of the glacier could collapse into the Val Ferret, a popular hiking area. Experts say the melting has been linked to climate change, which moved the freezing point this summer to above the top of Mont Blanc, western Europe's highest summit.  Scientists and officials sounded the alarm after the glacier saw ice movements of up to 50 centimetres (20 inches) a day were recorded, due to the creation of a deep fissure during higher-than-usual summer temperatures. The movement has slowed to 10 centimetres (four inches) a day in recent days.  The glacier itself spreads 1,327 square kilometres (512 square miles) across the Grande Jorasses mountain in the Mont Blanc massif, which straddles Italy, France and Switzerland.  Climate change has contributed to a decrease in glacial mass throughout the Alps. A new special report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change this week said that glacier melt is happening faster than before and is accelerating.    The collapse of the unstable section of the Planpincieux glacier is not inevitable. But if it does fall all at once — the worst-case scenario — it's projected to reach the valley road that has been closed, said Fabrizio Troilo, a glaciologist with the Safe Mountain Foundation, which has been monitoring the Planpincieux glacier since 2012.  ""We hope this big part of the glacier that is destabilized will fall down in smaller pieces,"" Troilo said, but added there was no way to forecast if it will happen as a single event or multiple smaller collapses. The mayor said it was also possible that no major break would happen, especially if the winter freeze arrives and stabilizes the glacier's movement.  Even though the road is opened up three times for residents, they are growing weary of the precaution.  ""I'd say this thing needs to fall. We are waiting for it to fall and we hope it will happen as fast as possible in order to save us all and free us from all this hassle,"" said Marco Belfrond, owner of the Miravalle hotel in Planpincieux, who has watched the glacier recede over the last 40 years.  Belfrond said his hotel wasn't at risk, but that the road closure was limiting the arrival of guests.    ""Thankfully it is low-season, so we don't have much movement. If it had happened in July or August, it would be much worse,"" he said.  Experts have ruled out using explosives to end the uncertainty.  ""Explosives on ice don't work well, and when the ice is fractured, it doesn't work at all. So, it would be a waste of time,"" Troilo explained.    ",technology
311,'Incredibly cute' ancient baby bottles discovered by archeologists,"Ceramic vessels, sometimes fashioned in whimsical animal forms, were used thousands of years ago as baby bottles to give animal milk to infants, according to scientists, offering an intriguing look at how and what infants were fed in prehistoric times.  Archeologists said on Wednesday they confirmed the function of these ceramic objects by finding chemical traces of milk belonging to animals such as cows, sheep and goats in three such items discovered buried in child graves in Germany.      They testify to the creativity and playfulness we often forget to attribute to our ancestors.  - Katharina Rebay-Salisbury, archeologist     The oldest of the three vessels in the study was made between 2,800 and 3,200 years ago during the Bronze Age. Other similar objects dating back as far as about 7,000 years during Neolithic times have been found in various other locations, the researchers said.    ""I think this has provided us the first direct evidence of what foods baby were eating or being weaned onto in prehistory,"" said biomolecular archeologist Julie Dunne, of the University of Bristol in Britain, lead author of the study published in the journal Nature.  ""I think this shows us the love and care these prehistoric people had for their babies.""  These objects, little enough to fit in a baby's hands, served as vessels for milk, with a narrow spout for the baby to suckle liquid. While the three objects examined for the study were somewhat plain, others boasted lively shapes, including animal heads with long ears or horns and human-looking feet.  Meant as toys too?  ""I find them incredibly cute. And prehistoric people may have thought so, too — they would certainly have a dual function of entertaining the children just like modern stuffed animals,"" said archeologist Katharina Rebay-Salisbury of the Institute for Oriental and European Archaeology of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, a study co-author.  ""They testify to the creativity and playfulness we often forget to attribute to our ancestors.""    Life at the time was not easy, Rebay-Salisbury added, with many people living in unhygienic conditions, experiencing famine and disease, and facing low life expectancy. During the Bronze Age and subsequent Iron Age in Europe, perhaps about a third of all newborns died before their first birthday and only about half of children reached adulthood, Rebay-Salisbury said.    These feeding vessels may have made life easier for mothers, as animal milk could substitute for breastfeeding, the researchers said.  ""Duties of mothering — amongst which feeding is an important one — can also be undertaken by other members of the community when children are fed with feeding vessels,"" Rebay-Salisbury said.",technology
312,Greta Thunberg was right: There is an alternative to 'eternal economic growth': Don Pittis,"In a quote heard around the world this week a 16-year-old climate activist threw down the gauntlet.  Greta Thunberg's passion reached deep into our hearts when she angrily called on our leaders to stop the suffering and dying, to stop entire ecosystems from collapsing.  But with the next sentence in that widely quoted appeal for action, Thunberg did something many of the most powerful people in the world will find harder to swallow: she thrust a knife into the beating heart of conventional economics.  ""We are at the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you!""  To most economists, money and endless economic growth are no fairy tales, they are essential to how the world works, how lives are improved, how people earn their living.  But there is another way of understanding economics that comes under the general title of sustainable prosperity, and a Canadian economist is one of the world's principal exponents of how such a system would work.  Business contribution  Tomorrow, as students and many others participate in the strike for climate change, there are signs business would like to show support. Mountain Equipment Co-op will close its doors. Upmarket fashion brand Patagonia has offered space for sign-making. Amazon's Jeff Bezos has announced he will buy electric delivery vans once they become available. Canada's financial sector has expressed concern.  Asked by host Laura Lynch on CBC Radio's The Current this week about talk of business contributions to the climate change fight, environmentalist Bill McKibben was skeptical.    ""The talk is growing, but it's not about how the financial sector is fighting climate change,"" said McKibben, a founder of the group 350.org, ""It's about how the financial sector is continuing to propel climate change.""  McKibben cited a list of the world's biggest banks that continue to invest in the carbon-intensive industries that are making climate change worse. Four of Canada's big banks — RBC, TD, Scotia and BMO — are in the global top 10.    Canadian economist and author Peter Victor, who studied at UBC and taught at Toronto's York University, says that conflict between words and investment is the crux of the collision between the traditional way of thinking about business — the idea of investing for endless growth — that has to be overcome to stop climate change.  And clearly, for most economic thinkers trapped in the long-held view that boosting GDP with industrial growth is the most important job for governments and business, Victor's newly revised second edition of his book Managing Without Growth: Slower by Design, Not Disaster may be difficult reading.  ""Most economists would really take the position that there is no choice: If you don't have growth, the system would collapse,"" said Victor this week from a cabin somewhere near Ontario's Algonquin Park.  Prosperity without growth  Victor has created a low-growth simulation model for the Canadian economy to demonstrate that there is a choice. Getting from here to there may be difficult, but in principle he says his work shows there are no economic reasons why Canada cannot be prosperous in the absence of traditional, industrial, GDP-style growth.  As he describes in a slightly out-of-date 2013 video lecture embedded below, the concept of economic growth is a relatively recent post-war invention. According to the 2016 book The Rise and Fall of American Growth, the growth era may be ending in any case.    But endless growth could be replaced by shifting growth.  ""Even in an economy that is not growing, you can have a lot of dynamic change,"" said Victor. ""We need some sectors to grow if we're going to switch from fossil fuels to renewables, for instance.""  And we will still have to keep busy, not least in figuring out ways of making our economy keep ticking in the face of climate change. Building sea walls to protect a city does not increase output like building a new factory or increasing oil output, but it is useful.  So are many things that are not traditionally seen as helping the economy grow, including creating art, looking after friends and family, participating in political activity — things not properly captured in GDP and therefore not contributing to growth. Maybe economists can recalibrate our system to value those activities.  Studies of well-being have indicated that faster growth does not give people more free time or make people happier. A low-growth economy could do that.  Repeated analysis has shown that the current understanding of economic growth is using up the planet's resources at a rate that cannot be sustained. As the title of Victor's book implies, disaster would end growth one way or another, just more abruptly.  According to Victor, adapting to a low-growth economy will be complex and demanding, but there will be many compensations, such as not destroying the planet and not driving the rest of the world's plants and animals into extinction. Of course, that was Thunberg's point.  WATCH | Canadian economist Peter Victor explains his theory of ecological economics:    Follow Don on Twitter @don_pittis",technology
313,The Liberals' 'net-zero' carbon pledge: more action and more fights,"Canada remains a long way from meeting its 2030 greenhouse gas reduction targets under the Paris Agreement, but adopting an even more ambitious goal for 2050 might actually be the best way forward, say experts and environmentalists.   In a series of campaign events on Wednesday, the federal Liberal Party rolled out a promise to commit Canada to net-zero carbon emissions —  meaning any greenhouse gases still produced would be offset — by 2050, if returned to power. Similar pledges have already been made by 65 other nations and the European Union, all of them spurred by last year's findings from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that global heating needs to be limited to 1.5 degrees C, instead of the old two degree target, in order to avoid the worst effects.   This despite the fact that even under the most-optimistic scenario, Canada is only two-thirds of the way to meeting its far-less-onerous 2015 pledge to reduce total emissions to 30 per cent below 2005 levels by the end of the next decade.   It's another hard turn from a government that sponsored a motion declaring a national climate emergency in June, then approved the expansion of the Trans Mountain oil pipeline the very next day.   But climate change activists are greeting the promise with cautious optimism.  ""The 2050 pledge is meaningful because you are kind of setting up the North Star,"" says Keith Stewart, a senior energy strategist with Greenpeace Canada.   Following UK example  He is particularly heartened that the Liberals appear intent on following the same path that the United Kingdom has been on since 2008, enshrining carbon-reduction targets in law with five-year plans,and setting up an independent expert committee to advise the government on the best way to reduce the country's footprint — industry by industry, and sector by sector.     ""It takes it from being the Liberal, or Conservative, or NDP target to being a Canadian target,"" says Stewart. ""It's no longer a tribal thing.""    A report issued last fall by the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, part of the London School of Economics, found that the U.K.'s expert committee had helped both Labour and Conservative governments make headway on carbon-reduction goals. ""The [committee] has made a material difference to the way climate policy is conducted in terms of objectives (the statutory carbon targets), process (impact on parliamentary debate) and substance (e.g. influencing new laws on energy, infrastructure, housing and water),"" wrote the authors.   Michal Nachmany, a research fellow at Grantham, where she tracks global climate laws and policy, says the combination of firm government targets and outside, independent advice on how to achieve them has made it easier to reach a consensus on greenhouse gas reduction.   Sends a clear signal  ""It sends out a very clear signal to actors — companies, investors, consumers — who need to make longer-term decisions,"" she says. ""It provides certainty and that's really good for the economy.""  And the legally binding targets seem to help protect governments from being sued over their lack of action — a growing trend since an environmental group won a landmark 2015 judgment against the Dutch government forcing it to adopt more ambitious greenhouse gas reduction targets.  ""So far, it seems to be riskier not to have a law than to have one,"" says Joana Setzer, another Grantham fellow who tracks such climate change litigation — 260 cases and counting across 27 countries (Canada accounts for 12 of them),  and another 922 suits against state and federal authorities in the United States.    The flipside, however, is that binding, national carbon emission targets could put Ottawa and the provinces on a collision course.  Clash with provinces likely  ""The devil will be in the details, but this promise seems most likely to impact provincial (greenhouse gas reduction) frameworks,"" says Sander Duncanson, a Calgary partner with Osler, Hoskin &amp; Harcourt, who specializes in environmental and regulatory law.   To date, the provinces have largely been able to pursue their own strategies via cap-and-trade agreements, carbon taxes, and large emitter levies. Any move towards a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach is likely to be met with a ""fair amount of resistance"" from the provinces and industry, notes Duncanson.  And even if the Liberals win re-election and turn their promise into law, that won't necessarily stop a future government from reversing course, as Doug Ford did when he became Ontario premier, passing a law to kill a cap-and-trade climate plan that had been adopted under Kathleen Wynne.  What is clear is that meeting Canada's current 2030 greenhouse gas reduction target — let alone the more ambitious 2050 pledge — will require heavy lifting, with lots of investment and sacrifice, regardless of which party is in power.  ""The low hanging fruit has been picked. Cheap and easy is gone,"" says Greenpeace's Stewart. ""Now, we have to do the hard things.""",technology
314,Trudeau promises to boost environmental protection and teach more kids to camp,"Justin Trudeau said today a re-elected Liberal government would protect a quarter of Canada's natural land and ocean habitats by 2025, and would become a global champion in setting international conservation targets.  During a campaign event in Sudbury, Ont. after taking a morning canoe paddle around a local lake, the Liberal leader also promised today to launch a new program aimed at encouraging more youth and families to enjoy the great outdoors.  The promised land and ocean conservation target — 25 per cent by 2025 — is an increase over the current target of 17 per cent for land protection and is nearly double the 12.4 per cent of Canada's land habitats currently being protected.  ""We know that not only can we protect 25 per cent of our land and 25 per cent of our oceans by 2025, but we must,"" Trudeau said.  ""It is an essential part, not just of protecting biodiversity, not just of fighting climate change, but of also ensuring that future generations have the opportunities we've had growing up and the economic opportunities that come with biodiversity and investments in ecotourism in general. We know that this is the path forward for Canada and that's why we're going to do it.""  The Liberals say they would work toward protection of 30 per cent of land and marine habitats by 2030 by tapping into Indigenous knowledge, stewardship and leadership and collaborating with other levels of government within their jurisdictions, according to the party's background materials.    The Liberals also promise to push for a 30-per-cent conservation target by 2030 for countries around the world at international gatherings.    Today's announcement also includes a plan to teach every young Canadian the skills to camp by Grade 8, and a promise to create a national Experience Canada program that would help 75,000 lower-income families spend up to four days in one of Canada's national or provincial parks every year.  That program would include camping accommodations and a travel bursary of up to $2,000 to allow lower-income families to experience places across like Killarney, Banff, Gros Morne and the Cape Breton Highlands, according to the Liberals. The program also would partner with Via Rail to make the opportunities accessible and affordable for even more Canadian families, the Liberals say.    According to the Liberal Party, the measures would have a net cost of $75 million in 2020-2021, which would rise to $150 million by 2023-2024.  Independent costing by the Parliamentary Budget Officer was not provided; the Liberals are saying that further details will be released ""over the course of the campaign.""  Today's announcement is the third in a series of Liberal promises related to the environment and climate change this week.  Trudeau to march in Montreal climate rally  They come as young people prepare to take part in marches around the world calling for urgent action by political leaders to tackle climate change. Swedish teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg will take part in what's expected to be a massive march drawing hundreds of thousands to the streets in Montreal Friday.  Today, Trudeau confirmed he will also be in attendance.  ""I look forward to marching with thousands of Canadians tomorrow in Montreal, like people are marching right across the country and around the world to fight for the environment,"" he said.  On Tuesday, Trudeau announced that a re-elected Liberal government would halve the corporate tax rate for companies that develop or manufacture products with zero emissions — part of the party's plan to move to net-zero emissions by 2050.  Net-zero emissions plan  Eligible sectors could include manufacturing related to renewable energy, production of renewable fuels, zero emission vehicles and batteries for them, carbon capture and removal technology and electric vehicle charging systems.  It's part of the wider Liberal promise to push Canada to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The European Union and other countries made the same climate pledge at the United Nations in New York City this week.  The Liberal Party's plan is to set legally-binding, five-year milestones to reach net-zero emissions in 30 years. The party says the net-zero plan would be based on the advice of scientists, economists and other experts, as well as consultations with Canadians.  Net-zero means some sectors could still emit carbon pollution, but those emissions would be offset by other actions such as planting trees.  On Wednesday, Trudeau said a re-elected Liberal government would give Canadians access to interest-free loans of up to $40,000 to upgrade old furnaces, replace leaky windows or retrofit their homes to make them more energy-efficient and resilient to floods and wildfires caused by climate change.  The Liberal Party says the program would offer a free energy audit and would help to retrofit about 1.5 million homes.  The Liberals have also pledged $100 million in skills training to make sure there are enough qualified workers to handle the energy audits, retrofits and net-zero home construction.  The Liberal climate change plan also would create a low-cost national flood insurance program to help homeowners in high-risk flood zones, complete flood maps, develop a national action plan to help homeowners in flood zones with potential relocation, and introduce an Employment Insurance Disaster Assistance Benefit to help people whose jobs and livelihoods are affected by extreme weather.

315,Trans Mountain oil tankers aren't the only thing endangering whales on the West Coast,"As Captain Aaron Nagler sets out onto the water, his boat navigates through a harbour full of vessels, from kayaks and sea ferries to sailing yachts.  Past the waters around Granville Island, in the heart of Vancouver, Nagler cruises by much larger ships hauling grain and coal, and another vessel filled with shipping containers. Beyond all the traffic, the horizon opens up as the engine pushes the boat further away from the coast.  ""There have been a number of recent reports from this afternoon of a certain black and white species up in Howe Sound,"" Nagler says over the speakers. ""Just keep a lookout on all sides, and if anything catches your eye, go ahead and let us know.""  About an hour after departing the harbour, he peers into the distance, transfixed by something out on the open water. Without diverting his glance, he grabs the binoculars by his side.  Nagler has found what his 67 passengers were looking for. Whales.  Passengers scramble to one side of the Prince of Whales Whale Watching boat and begin to snap pictures and videos.  These killer whales are iconic animals people travel around the world to see, and they're a big part of Indigenous culture. They are also part of a complex — and intense — discussion about the future of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion.    Construction of the pipeline is currently limited to its West Coast terminals, but activity should ramp up in and around Edmonton next month. The expansion is expected to be completed by mid-2022, and once finished, it will transport oil and other petroleum products from Edmonton to the Vancouver area.  Whichever federal party forms government after next month's election will have to handle the project, which is estimated to cost between $7.4 billion and $9.3 billion to construct. The next government will also have to navigate some choppy waters, weighing issues such as economic growth, climate change, environmental protection and Indigenous rights.  Western Canada relies heavily on B.C.'s ports. In Vancouver, the talk is largely focused on what an increase in oil tankers might mean for the ocean, the shipping industry and the killer whales and other marine life.   But the fact is, regardless of whether the Trans Mountain expansion pipeline is built, just about every type of vessel is increasing in numbers here — including whale-watching boats.  Increased tanker traffic  On this trip, Nagler and his passengers see an adult male and female killer whale, along with two young whales. These are transient killer whales, which come to the surface for about 30 seconds every five minutes or so.    They are different from southern resident killer whales, which are most often discussed in connection with the Trans Mountain expansion. One of the differences between the species is that the southern resident killer whales only eat salmon, while transient killer whales have a diverse diet. The southern resident killer whales have been called an endangered population.  Nagler's boat stays between 200 and 400 metres away from this particular pod.  ""Occasionally, boats will get too close to whales. It does happen, I've done it myself,"" said Nagler. ""It's difficult to track animals that disappear underwater and come up somewhere else. They can quite often change direction. That's why you have to keep your speed down and be as cautious as possible.""  While the whale-watching industry hasn't always had the best reputation for looking out for the animals, Nagler recounts stories of people on jet skis getting right up to the killer whales.  ""You can get off a plane in Vancouver at YVR [the international airport] and be harassing a killer whale within an hour and a half,"" he said.  While there can be finger-pointing about which type of vessels cause the most harm, it's not the whale-watching boats or jet skis attracting the most attention in recent years. It's oil tankers.  Similar to how the Keystone XL pipeline has been a lightning rod for the climate change debate in the U.S., the Trans Mountain expansion has galvanized those concerned about the killer whales and other marine life.  The Trans Mountain expansion is expected to result in a seven-fold increase in the number of oil tankers traveling through the waters around Vancouver and Victoria as they transport oil to California, China and other foreign buyers.  'Destruction of the killer whale'  When the National Energy Board (NEB) renewed its approval of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion in February, it acknowledged an increase in marine vessels would further contribute to effects that have jeopardized the recovery of the southern resident killer whales.     ""Indigenous people are not going to stand idly by and watch the destruction of the killer whale populations along the West Coast of British Columbia,"" said Grand Chief Stewart Phillip with the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs, after the NEB's report was issued.   Phillip said it's ""inconceivable"" that ""economic interests are more important than the iconic killer whale population and everything that represents for Indigenous peoples."" (The Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs, the Squamish Nation and the Tsleil-Waututh Nation were unavailable for comment for this story.)  The NEB introduced 16 new recommendations designed to better protect marine life on the B.C. coast, such as possible slowdowns in certain shipping routes and noise reduction on ferries. The recommendations are for all marine vessels, since the NEB said there would be little effect if the measures only applied to tankers from the Trans Mountain project.     The NEB's 16 recommendations for TMX re-approval    The NEB had considered other measures, such as limiting the number of whale-watching boats and the amount of time they spend on the water.  Trans Mountain has said it typically loads five tankers per month, but the expanded system would require about 34 tankers per month. Trans Mountain tanker traffic would increase from 1.1 per cent of total marine traffic volume now in the Juan de Fuca Strait — which stretches from Victoria to the outlet of the Pacific Ocean — to 6.6 per cent.  In total, about 18,500 vessels traveled in the Juan de Fuca Strait in 2012, according to figures Trans Mountain supplied to the federal government.  'It's a working harbour'  The Trans Mountain pipeline expansion has drawn more attention to marine traffic, said Stewart Muir with Resource Works, a Vancouver-based not-for-profit that advocates for the resource sector.  ""If it wasn't for the Trans Mountain Expansion, we wouldn't be talking about killer whales the way we are now,"" said Muir. ""In that sense, it's a positive, because it has brought about some positive policy steps.""  Walking along the seawall near the cruise ship dock, Muir points out all the activity on the water. There are bulk ships being loaded with sulphur and potash, a boat approaching a grain terminal, a cargo ship filled with containers leaving the port and a seaplane roaring its engine as it begins to take off.    ""It's a working harbour, it's been the heartbeat of the western Canadian economy since Confederation,"" Muir said.  So far this year, the Port of Vancouver is handling a record amount of container volume. The port has experienced about a 3.5 per cent increase in the first half of 2019, which is similar to growth levels over the last decade. Officials expect volume increases at the same rate for the next five years.  The West Coast could run out of space to handle shipments, according to the Vancouver Fraser Port Authority, which is seeking regulatory approval to construct its Roberts Bank complex site south of Vancouver.  ""We need these projects, otherwise we will be out of capacity in the early 2020s,"" said Peter Xotta, a vice president with the port authority.  Over the last year, the largest cargo increases have been in exporting wheat (22.4 per cent), specialty crops (34.2 per cent) and fertilizer (23.6 per cent). Just about every type of vessel is expected to increase in numbers, including recreational boats, cruise ships, chemical tankers, cargo ships, tugs and passenger vessels.    On the day the NEB's report was issued in February, the B.C. government announced the addition of 2,700 round trips per year on 10 routes for BC Ferries.    More ships increases the chance of an accident. The tankers carry oil from the bitumen-rich oilsands of northern Alberta, but a variety of other materials, like chemicals and coal, also travel through the port.  The spill concerns are well understood by pilots, who are in charge of navigating large vessels through the waters around Vancouver and Victoria.  Every time there is a new project, terminal or vessel type, the  Pacific Pilotage Authority is involved in the risk assessment. Pilots are on board every incoming and outgoing tanker for the voyage between Victoria and the Trans Mountain terminal in Burnaby.  ""Ever since pilots have been moving tankers on our coast, there has not been one incident on a tanker,"" said Brian Young, the director of marine operations for the Pacific Pilotage Authority. In terms of overall safety statistics for any type of vessel, he said the organization is ""in the 99.96 to 99.67 percentile of completing jobs perfectly.""  'Multiple stressors'  Beyond spill concerns, there are worries about noise, strikes and, to a lesser degree, the pollution associated with vessel traffic. These are all significant contributors to the problems facing some of the whale and marine life populations, said Kai Chan, a professor at the University of British Columbia's Institute for Resources, Environment and Sustainability.    The animals are ""being exposed to multiple stressors, several of which are new, many of which are continuing to escalate due to increasing human activity in the region,"" said Chan. ""When we have populations like the southern resident killer whales, for example, a population that is endemic to this region and is suffering significantly, imagine increasing a couple of those stressors it's facing. It's concerning, for sure.""  Chan said it's not just about the Trans Mountain expansion. ""There are all kinds of other uses of that space of the Salish Sea, of the Georgia Straight, that are taxing these populations.""    Almost every mitigation effort seems to have a drawback or the potential of an unknown side effect.  ""Ecosystems are complex,"" said Chan. ""We often don't know well enough what will work until we try it.""    Chan had wanted more robust environmental protections for the Trans Mountain expansion project, including a commitment to follow up to make sure the provisions are working as hoped.  He said the attention on the killer whales and other marine life as a result of the proposed pipeline project is positive, but it needs to go further.  ""It's clear people are concerned. But the conversation about what are we willing to let go, what are we willing to put the brakes on, is one that we really do have to have collectively,"" he said. ""It should not be reduced to a single decision around a single pipeline decision, because it's a bigger issue than that.""",technology
316,Quebec's environmental movement has had a long string of victories. What's the secret to its success?,"Since the spring, hundreds, maybe thousands, of Quebec teens have been meeting after school to lay the groundwork for a massive protest in Montreal demanding urgent action on climate change.  When it gets underway Friday at noon, led by 16-year-old activist phenomenon Greta Thunberg, it's expected to be the largest demonstration in the history of Quebec's environmental movement.   Not that the movement has struggled to get people in the streets. A march in Montreal last spring attracted more than 100,000 people; there were 50,000 at a protest following last year's provincial election.   But the strength of the environmental movement in Quebec goes beyond its ability to organize sizeable demonstrations.  A recent Canada-wide study of opinions about climate change found Quebecers were more likely than other Canadians to believe the Earth is warming. They were also more likely to believe climate change is due to human activity and more likely to support carbon pricing as a way to combat it.    That outlook has translated into a desire for federal politicians to address the issue.  Nearly 40 per cent of Quebecers who took part in CBC's Vote Compass survey listed the environment as their most important issue of the current election campaign, more than in any other region in the country.  Among Quebec respondents, the environment outstripped the economy, health care, taxes and every other issue.  So why have Quebecers come to care about environmental issues more than other Canadians (even if they don't always act on that concern)?  The benefits of 'blue gold'  Many environmentalists in the province feel their cause benefits from commonplace expressions of Quebec nationalism that invoke a special relationship with the environment.   Quebec's ""blue gold"" — water — plays an important role in the story of how the province modernized: It was the nationalization of Hydro-Québec that helped spark the Quiet Revolution.    ""Quebecers are proud of hydro power because it is a symbol of when Quebecers, who had been poor for 200 years, decided to build a modern society and seize control of their economy,"" said Karel Mayrand, Quebec director of the David Suzuki Foundation.  Hydroelectricity turned out to be an energy source that emits much fewer emissions than coal, gas or oil.   At a moment when energy is central to provincial identities in Canada, Quebecers have been quick to boast of the environmental upsides of their main power source.     And efforts by Hydro-Québec to diversify its supply beyond hydro power have often been met with resistance.   Indeed, one such effort — a plan to build a natural gas power station in Beauharnois, near Montreal — was an important catalyst for the current wave of environmental activism in the province.   Chalking up the wins   The Beauharnois project was floated in the early 2000s amid some debate about how Canada would meet its obligations under the Kyoto Protocol, which required countries to begin lowering their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.   Environmental activists in Quebec pointed out the proposed natural gas plant would emit 2.2 million tonnes of GHG emissions annually.    Much to their surprise, that argument struck a chord with the wider public. Opposition to the project grew progressively louder, eventually forcing the government to nix it.   ""There was this uprising within the population that was quasi-spontaneous,"" recalled Patrick Bonin, who took part in the protests against the natural gas project and is now a climate campaigner with Greenpeace Canada.  ""It was one of the great environmental victories that showed that with the force of mobilization, we can change things,"" he said.    Other victories quickly followed.   In 2006, the provincial Liberal government took steps to privatize a provincial park. The project was shelved amid protest.   When gas companies sought to exploit shale gas formations along the St. Lawrence River, protests prompted the government to impose a moratorium in 2011.  In 2013, the province killed another resource project — a planned methane gas plant near Quebec City — again amid noisy protests from an alliance of citizens groups and environmental activists.    So, when TransCanada sought approval to build a cross-Canada pipeline through Quebec in 2014, it was confronted with an environmental movement that had a decade's worth of successful activism already under its belt.   The company scuttled the project, citing changing market conditions. Quebec's opposition to oil pipelines is now taken as a political fact.  With each new victory, more people were brought into the movement, convinced of the merits of environmental activism, said Bonin.   That optimism is evident among the younger generation of activists.  ""We believe that we can actually win, which is one of the reasons we're more motivated,"" said Ben Clarkson, a spokesperson for La Planète s'invite au Parlement, one of the groups organizing Friday's climate march whose name translates as ""the planet goes to Parliament.""    One reason for the success of those campaigns against specific resource projects was that they were accompanied by broader efforts to educate Quebecers about climate change.   ""People came to understand that activism could not only block projects but could also propose solutions,"" said Bonin.  He credits these awareness campaigns for laying the groundwork for early government initiatives to reduce emissions.   In 2007, Quebec became the first jurisdiction in North America to implement a carbon tax.   The tax was phased out in 2014 as the province switched to a cap-and-trade system; it's currently the only province to use this method of carbon pricing.  A distinct society  A number of cultural factors have also helped environmental activism flourish in Quebec.  Mayrand said environmental measures like carbon pricing enjoy more support in part because Quebecers are used to government intervention in the economy.    In Western Canada, ""climate action is seen as a Trojan horse for more taxes and more government intervention in the economy and people's lives,"" he said. ""In Quebec, people expect the government to solve problems.""    Another factor that helps activists in Quebec is what, elsewhere, is called its ""distinct society.""    As residents of a francophone province, somewhat removed from the rest of Canada, activists find it easier to collaborate with each other and with non-traditional allies such as business groups.  ""Quebec is a smaller society, and maybe it's a little more cohesive because it's smaller,"" said Mayrand. ""The kind of social dialogue that we can have in Quebec makes it a lot easier to collaborate.""  Those cultural differences can exert themselves in other ways, too. A study published in 2012 found that coverage of environmental issues differed significantly in Quebec from the rest of Canada.  The study found that whereas French media in the province largely accepted global warming as fact, English outlets were ""happy to include claims of denial, scientific uncertainty and pro-business narratives in climate change reporting.""  'It's theirs, not ours'  As it has around the globe, the level of mobilization in Quebec increased dramatically following the publication last October of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, which concluded there are only 12 years left to keep the planet from warming beyond 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels.    ""That really alerted citizens to the urgency of acting within the next decade,"" said Catherine Gauthier, who heads the group Environnement Jenesse (ENJEU), which helps young people get involved in climate action.  ""I've been involved in the movement for 15 years, and I've never seen it this strong.""    Environmental activism in Quebec is now coming from just about every corner of society, with artists, municipalities and, above all, students driving the most prominent initiatives.   Several high schools in Montreal have cancelled classes on Friday, as have some universities and colleges, bowing to the desire of students to join the climate march.  ""The fact the youth are leading is changing things fundamentally,"" said Mayrand.  Big environmental groups, such as Greenpeace and the David Suzuki Foundation, have shifted to playing a supporting role for this new generation of climate activists.  ""Right now, they are the energy behind the movement. It's theirs, not ours,"" Mayrand said.",technology
317,"What an ice-free Arctic really means, and why it matters so much","This story is part of a CBC News series entitled In Our Backyard, which looks at the effects climate change is having in Canada, from extreme weather events to how it's reshaping our economy.    At Earth's poles, ice and snow is disappearing — and it's transforming our planet.   Snow and ice have long played a vital role in moderating Earth's climate. The white surfaces reflect the sun's radiation, which in turn helps maintain a comfortable temperature for life on the planet.  But with a warming planet, that ice melts or thins, exposing the dark water below, which absorbs that radiation. So each year the global temperature rises, melting more ice and snow. It's a positive feedback loop: warming causes ice melt, ice melt causes warming. And that process — also called Arctic amplification — leads to what we are observing now, which is a rapidly changing climate.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate, released Wednesday, suggests that we could see an ice-free Arctic once every 100 years if we limit warming to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels. If we warm to 2 C, that would increase to once every three years.  Could all that snow and ice at the poles eventually disappear altogether?  It's complicated.  The potential for an ice-free Arctic has been bandied about for decades, but it's important to know what scientists mean by ""ice-free.""    ""Usually when we talk about ice-free, it's virtually ice-free,"" said Jennifer Francis, senior scientist at Woods Hole Research Center in Falmouth, Mass. ""It's really during the late summer at the time when we usually see the minimum occur, which is right about now.""  So ice-free doesn't mean there's not one bit of ice left. It means that at minimum — which is usually in the middle of September — there is less than one million square kilometres. That may seem like a lot of ice, but the average minimum from 1981 to 2010 was roughly 6.3 million square kilometres.   This year was a bad year for the Arctic. On Sept. 23, the National Snow and Ice Data Center released the Arctic sea ice minimum for 2019, finding that it was the second lowest in satellite record, tied with 2007 and 2016, at 4.16 million square kilometres.  The lowest to date occurred in 2012, when the minimum reached a record low of roughly 3.4 million square kilometres.   The 13 lowest sea ice extents have all occurred within the past 13 years. This year, scientists were concerned that we were heading to a 2012 level, but in late August, weather patterns changed and there was some slight growth.     On top of how much area of ice is being lost, there's also the concern about how much old ice — thicker ice — we're losing, which is causing a big drop in the volume of ice contained in the Arctic.  ""It's been estimated that we've lost about three-quarters of the sea ice in terms of volume. Which is crazy. It's happened within 40 years,"" said Francis. ""It is just a mind-boggling statistic to throw at people. It still takes my breath away.""  The Arctic versus the Antarctic  Both poles play an important, though different, role in Earth's climate.   ""The Arctic Ocean is an ocean surrounded by continents, so the sea ice is kind of pinned in there and kind of protected,"" said Walt Meier, senior research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center. ""Whereas the Antarctic is a continent surrounded by oceans, so the sea ice grows outward from there.""    As a result, most of the Antarctic ice breaks up annually. There isn't much multi-year ice like there is in the Arctic. That means that the reflectivity of that ice — the albedo — doesn't play as large a role as that of the Arctic in regulating Earth's temperature.  And while there has been some back and forth with sea ice growth in the Antarctic, that's not the primary concern for glaciologists and climatologists for the region. Instead, it's the melting of the ice sheets, large areas of ice that sit atop land. Data shows that warmer ocean currents are causing rapid surface melting of these ice sheets and glaciers in West Antarctica. And that, in turn, leads to a rise in sea levels.   Effects  While some people believe that an ice-free Arctic could be a good thing — opening up a new shipping route, oil and gas extraction, and tourism — there are likely deep repercussions.  For one, oil and gas extraction is part of what is contributing to climate change. Exploration in the Arctic would release more of the very greenhouse gases that caused the rapid Arctic ice loss in the first place.   There are also concerns over Canadian Arctic sovereignty, and that a rise in shipping activity also increases the chance of an environmental disaster that could further threaten the already-delicate Arctic ecosystem.    But an ice-free Arctic has even more far-reaching effects. As the saying goes: What happens in the Arctic doesn't stay in the Arctic.  ""It's an experiment on a grand scale,"" said Paul Crowley, the World Wildlife Fund's Arctic vice-president. ""The north, the Canadian Arctic, folks in the north, our communities are already challenged. So this is just another layer.""  Crowley notes that melting permafrost in the western Arctic is causing houses to sink or collapse; roads are falling apart; airstrips are no longer facing the right direction because of changing winds; and harvesters and hunters, who long relied on traditional knowledge, are now facing new conditions like thin ice that is costing lives.    And then there's the weather around the world. The jet stream, a column of air that travels from west to east that drives weather across the northern hemisphere, relies on the temperature difference between the Arctic and the south. But when the temperature difference is not as pronounced, the jet stream begins to develop kinks. This can have widespread effects such as creating systems that prolong heat waves in southern Ontario and Quebec or even Europe, or slow hurricanes to a near standstill, as was seen with Dorian earlier this month.  So although most Canadians — and most of the world's population — live far from the Arctic, its rapid changes will have effects felt across the globe.   ""I think we have an incredible capacity to adapt, but we're going to push our limits, and we're going to live in a world that is already difficult for very many,"" Crowley said. But, he added, bluntly, ""Of course we can better prepare, and be better at giving ourselves a chance at being resilient, but we need to stop crapping in our own bed.""  ",technology
318,New high-tech weapons detection system to be tested at Metro Toronto Convention Centre,"Providing security for a two-million-square-foot building is no easy feat, according to the vice president of operations at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre.  By Vince Quattrociocchi's estimation, the centre is a hub in downtown Toronto, sitting right on Front Street West with multiple access points from the Rogers Centre and Union Station for thousands of people to get in and out. If just one of those people is carrying a concealed weapon, that can spell disaster, so for Quattrociocchi, technology that's able to detect that weapon is essential.  ""Annually, we have upwards of one million-plus people that come visit us. And to have a system that is seamless and easy to walk past ... is intriguing to me.""  Quattrochiocci says that's one of the major reasons the convention centre signed a deal with U.S. security company Liberty Defense to test their new HEXWAVE security gates.   Liberty describes the HEXWAVE system as a series of radar imaging security gates that can be installed at the perimeter of any building. The system can detect metallic and non-metallic weapons concealed on a person, the company says.  Unlike metal detectors, Liberty Defense says its gate can be placed in locations where it can't be seen, such as inside signage or pillars, and can use radar technology to scan for the shape of the weapon.   Liberty Defense CEO Bill Riker says HEXWAVE portals can flag any possible dangers before armed intruders can reach the interior of a building.   ""With the uniqueness of the design, each [gate] is a standalone sensing and analysis communication device. That gives you a lot of flexibility in how they deploy it to their most high-traffic areas,"" Riker said.       Why Ottawa is hedging when it comes to handguns     Ontario legislature to get airport-style security, new visitor screening centre     The technology used in the gates was developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and still requires more testing before they can go on the market.   Other venues built for large crowds, such as Rogers Arena in Vancouver and FC Bayern Munich's Allianz Arena in Munich, Germany, have also signed on to help test the gates beginning in early 2020.   Riker says Liberty Defense's ultimate goal for the detection system is to process ""about a thousand people per hour, to pass through the screen zones.""  Privacy concerns over radar technology  Riker says he is well-aware of concerns about personal data and privacy. He says the HEXWAVE gates do not have the technology to identify or photograph faces or bodies.   ""We're only focused on the actual weapon or article of interest itself. But most significantly, the only thing that is seeing these images, is artificial intelligence ... It's not being sent out to a human to make a decision,"" he said.    Quattrochiocci says the gates at the convention centre will be tested with security staff over a one-week period, not with the public.  He also says the current agreement does not include finalized plans for permanent HEXWAVE systems in the building.

319,Placido Domingo withdraws from Met Opera amid sexual misconduct accusations,"The Metropolitan Opera announced Tuesday that Placido Domingo had agreed to withdraw from his slate of scheduled performances at the opera house following allegations of sexual harassment made by multiple women in two Associated Press stories. The opera legend indicated that he would never again perform at the Met.  Domingo had been scheduled to sing the title role in the season premiere of Verdi's Macbeth on Wednesday night, which would have been his first performance in the United States since the AP reported that numerous women had accused him of inappropriate behaviour, including one soprano who said he grabbed her bare breast.  The Met had been under increasing pressure to cancel Domingo's six scheduled appearances, but general manager Peter Gelb reiterated to performers after a dress rehearsal Saturday that the opera house was awaiting results of investigations by the L.A. Opera, where Domingo has been general director since 2003, and the American Guild of Musical Artists, the union that represents various opera staff.  Domingo, who had sung in rehearsals, issued a statement saying his Met career was over after what the company said was 706 performances as a singer, plus 169 as a conductor.  ""I made my debut at the Metropolitan Opera at the age of 27 and have sung at this magnificent theatre for 51 consecutive, glorious years,"" the star said. ""While I strongly dispute recent allegations made about me, and I am concerned about a climate in which people are condemned without due process, upon reflection, I believe that my appearance in this production of Macbeth would distract from the hard work of my colleagues both on stage and behind the scenes.    ""As a result, I have asked to withdraw,"" he added, ""and I thank the leadership of the Met for graciously granting my request. I am happy that, at the age of 78, I was able to sing the wonderful title role in the dress rehearsal of Macbeth, which I consider my last performance on the Met stage.""  In its statement, the Met said the long-married, Spanish-born superstar had ""agreed to withdraw from all future performances at the Met, effective immediately.""  Gelb sent an email to the Met staff saying, ""We are grateful to him for recognizing that he needed to step down.""  Lengthy ovations  The Philadelphia Orchestra, San Francisco Opera and Dallas Opera previously cancelled upcoming concerts starring Domingo after the AP stories were published. But his reception has been far different in Europe, where he received lengthy ovations after concert performances of Verdi's Luisa Miller at the Salzburg Festival in Austria on Aug. 25 and 31, just weeks after the initial AP story.  One of Domingo's accusers, Patricia Wulf, called Domingo's withdrawal from the Met ""such a relief.  ""I feel like we accomplished something,"" said Wulf, who accused Domingo of repeatedly harassing her during performances at Washington Opera in the late 1990s, while he was general director of the company.  ""The Met finally stepped up and did the right thing,"" she told the AP.  In addition to announcing Domingo's withdrawal, Gelb said the Met was suspending tenor Vittorio Grigolo pending the outcome of an investigation opened Tuesday by the Royal Opera in London, which said he was alleged to be involved in a Sept. 18 incident when he sang the title role in Gounod's Faust on tour in Tokyo.    Grigolo, 42, was scheduled to sing six performances of Alfredo in Verdi's La Traviata at the Met in February and March. He did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.  The Met fired conductor James Levine in March 2018 after an investigation by a law firm retained by the company found evidence of sexual abuse and harassment. Levine, the company's music director from 1976-2016, was music director emeritus at the time and denied the allegations. He filed a breach of contract and defamation lawsuit that was settled last month.  Domingo made his Met debut in September 1968 and is known to many beyond opera for his performances as part of The Three Tenors with Luciano Pavarotti and Jose Carreras. Singing far beyond the retirement age of most singers, he shifted to baritone parts in 2009, extending his repertoire to more than 150 roles.    Next performance Oct. 13  Domingo's next scheduled performance is in Verdi's Nabucco at the Zurich Opera on Oct. 13. He is not slated to sing in the U.S. until Donizetti's Roberto Devereux at the LA Opera, which opens Feb. 22.  Zeljko Lucic will replace him for the Met's three performances of Macbeth. Domingo also had been scheduled for four performances as Sharpless in Puccini's Madama Butterfly at the Met in November.  Before Domingo's withdrawal, the New York state senator whose district includes the opera house had called for his removal.    ""I believe they have an obligation to hold their performers to a high standard, given the fact that they are one of the world's most important cultural institutions,"" said Brad Hoylman, a Democrat and state senator for New York.  ""They should be thinking also not just about his celebrity and star power, but about the 20 women who allegedly have made complaints,"" Hoylman said. ""The Met has an obligation to ensure the safety and well-being of their employees and I'm concerned that if they don't take action on this, this matter might discourage future employees from coming forward.""",entertainment
320,"Robert Hunter, Grateful Dead's poetic lyricist, dead at 78","Robert Hunter, the man behind the poetic and mystical words for many of the Grateful Dead's finest songs, has died at age 78.  Hunter died Monday at his Northern California home with his wife, Maureen, at his side, former Grateful Dead publicist Dennis McNally told The Associated Press on Tuesday.  The family did not release a cause of death.  ""We loved Bob Hunter and will miss him unimaginably,"" Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart said, adding the lyricist was ""a visionary wordsmith extraordinaire.""  Although proficient on a number of instruments including guitar, violin, cello and trumpet, Hunter never appeared on stage with the Grateful Dead during the group's 30-year run that ended with the 1995 death of lead guitarist Jerry Garcia, his principal songwriting partner.    When he did attend the group's concerts, he was content to either stand to the side of the stage or, better yet, sit anonymously in the audience. It was in the latter location, he told The Associated Press in 2006, that he received his greatest songwriting compliment, from a man who had no idea who he was.  ""He turned to me during Cumberland Blues and said, 'I wonder what the guy who wrote that song a hundred years ago would think if he knew the Grateful Dead was doing it,""' he recalled, referencing the colourful tale of hardscrabble American miners.    Other of Hunter's most memorable Grateful Dead songs include It Must Have Been the Roses, Terrapin Station, The Days Between, Brown Eyed Women, Jack Straw, Friend of the Devil, Box of Rain, Uncle John's Band and Black Muddy River.  Although the man who spoke to him during Cumberland Blues couldn't know it, he had perfectly captured Hunter's songwriting brilliance contained in all of those songs: the ability to craft lyrics that sounded so timeless that listeners were certain they had heard them before.  It was a skill he matched seamlessly with a boundless knowledge of subjects running the gamut from classic literature to street life, which in turn allowed him to write authoritatively about everyone from card sharks and hustlers to poor dirt farmers and free-spirited lovers.  All of those stories he seasoned with a poetic skill some would say rivaled even that of Bob Dylan, with whom he sometimes collaborated.  ""He's got a way with words and I do too,"" Dylan told Rolling Stone magazine in 2009. ""We both write a different type of song than what passes today for songwriting.""    ""There was nobody like Bob Hunter and there never will be,"" Hart said Tuesday. ""He explained the unexplainable and the words struck deep.""  Truckin', arguably Hunter and the group's best known song (and the one containing the memorable line, ""What a long, strange trip it's been"") was designated a national treasure in 1997 by the U.S. Library of Congress.  In more than a dozen verses it chronicled the travails of a touring band, among them the Grateful Dead's 1970 drug bust after a show in New Orleans: ""Busted, down on Bourbon Street. Set up, like a bowlin' pin. Knocked down. It gets to wearin' thin.""  Another song, Ripple, which was set to a maddening beautiful melody that Garcia composed on guitar, contains the lines Hunter once said he was most proud of: ""Reach out your hand, if your cup be empty. If your cup is full, may it be again. Let it be known there is a fountain. That was not made by the hands of men.""    Wide range of influences  Once asked by The Associated Press who his influences were, he laughed and replied that, ""just to throw people off,"" he would often cite both the great 19th century theatrical songwriting team of Gilbert and Sullivan and the American folk music balladeer Woody Guthrie.  After a moment's reflection, he added more seriously, ""Actually, that's pretty close to the truth.""  Other influencers included novelists James Joyce, John Steinbeck and Hans Christian Andersen, musician Josh White and the traditional European ballads published by American folklorist Francis James Child.    Born Robert Burns on June 23, 1941, Hunter was seven when his father abandoned him and his mother, resulting in his spending several years in foster homes. It was an experience he said scarred him emotionally and left him feeling forever the outsider.  When he was 11, his mother married McGraw-Hill publishing executive Norman Hunter, who gave the boy a new last name and an appreciation for such peerless writers as William Saroyan and T.S. Elliot.  Hunter toyed with becoming a novelist himself but music called and by his senior year of high school he was playing trumpet in a fusion Dixieland-rock band. He attended the University of Connecticut for one year where he studied drama, became a Pete Seeger fan and turned his interest to folk music.  When Bob met Jerry   He met Garcia in 1960 at a production of the musical Damn Yankees, introduced by a former girlfriend who by then was Garcia's first wife. The pair quickly formed a folk music duo called Bob and Jerry.  Both homeless for a time, they lived out of their cars, parking them side-by-side in a Palo Alto, Calif., vacant lot. They survived those days, both would say later, by eating tins of pineapple Hunter had pilfered from a military installation during his brief time in the National Guard.  Hunter had moved to New Mexico by the time Garcia, Bob Weir, Bill Kreutzmann, Phil Lesh and Ron ""Pigpen"" McKernan had formed the Grateful Dead. Hart would join soon after.  When Garcia asked him to send some lyrics along that could be set to music Hunter quickly responded with future Grateful Dead classics China Cat Sunflower and St. Stephen. Garcia then asked him to return to the San Francisco Bay Area and write for the band.    Eventually Hunter would write for all of the group's members, and when the Grateful Dead was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 he was included as the lyricist. He and Garcia were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2015.  Over the years Hunter also released nearly a dozen albums of his own, published several volumes of poetry and co-wrote songs with Dylan. He also published two books translating the works of German poet Rainer Maria Rilke.  ""Bob was an intellectual and I can't tell you that there are a lot of intellectuals in the rock and roll business. But Bob was an intellectual,"" longtime friend Barry (The Fish) Melton of Country Joe and the Fish said by phone from Paris Tuesday.  Hunter's survivors include his wife and daughter Kate.",entertainment
321,Families of Colorado shooting victims urge Joker studio to lobby for gun control,"Alarmed by violence depicted in a trailer for the upcoming movie Joker, some relatives of victims of the 2012 Aurora, Colo., movie theatre shooting asked distributor Warner Bros. on Tuesday to commit to gun control causes.  Sandy Phillips' daughter, Jessica Ghawi, was one of 12 people killed in the suburban Denver theatre during a midnight showing of the Batman film, The Dark Knight Rises, also distributed by Warner Bros.  Phillips said she and four other people who lost loved ones in Aurora sent a letter to Warner on Tuesday, asking the studio to lobby Congress for gun control, support survivor programs and end any contributions to politicians backed by the National Rifle Association.  ""When we learned that Warner Bros. was releasing a movie called Joker that presents the character as a protagonist with a sympathetic origin story, it gave us pause,"" the letter reads. ""We want to be clear that we support your right to free speech and free expression. But as anyone who has ever seen a comic book movie can tell you: with great power comes great responsibility.""  Warner issued a statement later Tuesday saying it has always supported victims of gun violence and calling on policymakers to enact bipartisan legislation to address what it called an epidemic.  'Immediately triggered'  Phillips says she was compelled to act after seeing a trailer for Joker, the name of the Batman villain portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix in the film being released Oct. 4.  ""My jaw dropped. I went, 'Oh my god.' And that was just the trailer. I was immediately triggered,"" she said.  ""Our purpose is to make the movie studios, the directors, the actors aware that when they make movie like this, they affect us directly,"" Phillips said. ""For someone who idolizes mass shooters, idolizes guns, that's the kind of movie they absolutely love.""  Phillips' support group, Survivors Empowered, and activist Igor Volsky of Guns Down America sent the letter to Warner CEO Ann Sarnoff.  ""Companies like Warner have real leverage where Congress has failed,"" said Volsky, citing recent actions by Walmart to stop selling handgun and short-barrel rifle ammunition after a string of mass shootings. ""That's why we are not calling for a boycott of this film. They have an opportunity to lead on this issue.""  Joker has been the subject of much debate since it premiered late last month at the Venice International Film Festival, where it won the top prize. It's also expected to be a major awards contender.  The film is a character study of how Arthur Fleck, an aspiring but mentally ill comedian and clown-for-hire, becomes the classic Batman nemesis.    Director and co-writer Todd Phillips told The Associated Press last month that the villain portrayed by Phoenix is presented in an ""empathetic way.""  ""You're kind of on his side until you can't be any longer,"" Todd Phillips said.  Todd Phillips also questioned why some are conflating Joker with the movie theatre shooting in Aurora in 2012.  ""Aurora is obviously a horrible, horrible situation,"" Todd Phillips said. ""But even that is not something you blame on the movie.""  Not 'a hero'  Prosecutors and a psychiatrist who evaluated gunman James Holmes have discounted some initial press reports that he had told authorities he was the Joker.  Phoenix told the AP that he thinks it's a good thing for movies to challenge an audience and that it's not incumbent on the film or filmmaker to hold back because of how an audience might misinterpret the message.  ""I don't think it's the filmmaker's responsibility to teach morality,"" Phoenix said. ""And if you don't know the difference between right and wrong, then there's all sorts of things that you are going to interpret in the way that you want.""    ""Make no mistake: Neither the fictional character Joker, nor the film, is an endorsement of real-world violence of any kind,"" the Warner statement said. ""It is not the intention of the film, the filmmakers or the studio to hold this character up as a hero.""  The Aurora theatre was remodelled and renamed after the 2012 shooting that also wounded 58 people. Holmes was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole.  Reached by telephone, an employee at Century Aurora and XD said Tuesday there were no immediate plans to show Joker at the theatre but referred calls for comment to Cinemark spokesman James Meredith.  Meredith didn't immediately return those calls.  ",entertainment
322,"Ai Weiwei sculpture made of 1,254 bicycles goes up at The Forks","A 30-foot sculptural piece created from 1,254 bicycles by internationally acclaimed artist and activist Ai Weiwei is under construction in Winnipeg.  The piece, which should be complete by the end of the week in time for the arts festival Nuit Blanche, is near the skateboard park at The Forks, against the backdrop of the Canadian Museum for Human Rights.  Titled Forever Bicycles, the sculpture alludes to the bikes that flooded the streets of China, Ai's home country, during his childhood. Despite their seeming omnipresence, bicycles remained financially out of reach for many, including Ai's family.  His father, poet Ai Qing, was denounced by China's Communist Party in 1958 and his family was sent to labour camps, first near the North Korean border and then eventually in Xinjiang province.  They returned to Beijing in 1976 after the end of the cultural revolution.    The Forks was seen as a perfect location for the piece because of its history, the number and diversity of its visitors, its accessibility to the public and its focus on public art, a news release from The Forks says.  The view from Forever Bicycles to the human rights museum is intentional. Ai is known for his human rights-related activism; he's openly critical of the Chinese government's stance on that topic and democracy.  Much of his work focuses on similar issues in other parts of the world as well. He was awarded the Adrienne Clarkson Prize for Global Citizenship in 2017.    His artwork and films have been displayed in Tokyo, Washington, New York, Israel, Mexico City and Inner Mongolia, among many other locations.  This is the first time it has been in Winnipeg.    ""This is one of the most significant examples of contemporary public art in the world today. Its message is both profound and timely,"" Winnipeg philanthropist and arts patron Michael Nesbitt said in the news release. Nesbitt's donation to The Forks Foundation funded the loan and installation of Forever Bicycles.  ""It's important that this work is being displayed at such a historic Canadian venue.""  Ai is not in the city himself. The sculpture is being assembled by London, U.K.-based installers who have put up the piece in locations around the world.  A spokesperson from The Forks said the hope is to have Ai come to Winnipeg in the spring.    The Forks CEO Paul Jordan said art helps fulfil the mission and purpose of the historic public space, which is used for celebrations and recreation.  ""Our role is to be a meeting place, open and accessible to everyone. Everything we do is run through that filter,"" he said.  ""Art is often seen as inaccessible to many. With the works coming to us, we are able to offer a space that's not only fun to visit, but thought-provoking, challenging and interesting for everyone.""  Ai's sculpture will be at The Forks site for two years, with a potential extension of one year.    ",entertainment
323,Kevin O'Leary's wife charged in Muskoka area boat crash that killed 2,"The wife of TV personality and businessman Kevin O'Leary is facing a single charge over a boat crash in the Muskoka area last month that left two people dead.  Linda O'Leary, 56, is charged with careless operation of a vessel, in contravention of the Canada Shipping Act, small vessel regulations. The charge carries a maximum penalty of up to 18 months imprisonment or a fine of up to $1 million, or both.  One other person is charged in connection with the collision, according to a news release issued Tuesday by the Ontario Provincial Police. Richard Ruh, 57, of Orchard Park, N.Y., has been charged with failing to exhibit a navigation light while underway, in contravention of Section 23 of the Canada Shipping Act, collision regulations.  Staff Sgt. Carolle Dionne, a spokesperson for the OPP, said Tuesday the charges follow ""a thorough investigation.""  ""Linda O'Leary's charges are before the courts, so there's very little other details that we can release to ensure a fair court proceeding,"" Dionne told CBC Toronto in a telephone interview.    Linda O'Leary an 'experienced boater'  Linda O'Leary's lawyer Brian Greenspan described his client as ""a cautious and experienced boater.""  He noted that police have charged the driver of the other boat with operating without a proper light, which may have contributed to the collision.  ""On this dark evening, [O'Leary], on approaching her home, tragically came into contact with an unlit boat,"" Greenspan told CBC Toronto.  ""She finds the entire matter tragic,"" he added. ""She's grief stricken.""     WATCH: The National's story on the boat crash    The collision occurred around 11:30 p.m. ET on Saturday, Aug. 24 near Emerald Island on Lake Joseph, a popular destination in the region about 215 kilometres north of downtown Toronto.  Gary Poltash, 64, from Florida, died the night of the crash. Susanne Brito, 48, a mother of three from Uxbridge, Ont., died in hospital the following Tuesday.    Three other people were taken to hospital with injuries and were released.  Linda O'Leary suffered a leg injury that required surgery, Greenspan said.  Just hours before the crash, Brito had posted a photo of the lake to social media with the words: ""Beautiful day! Enjoy.""  Kevin O'Leary issued a statement following the crash to say he was a passenger in one of the boats involved in the collision and that he was co-operating with the police investigation.   O'Leary, a businessman and former Dragons' Den star on CBC, made a bid for the federal Conservative leadership race before dropping out in 2017. He now appears on the ABC show Shark Tank in the United States.  Linda O'Leary is scheduled to appear in court in Parry Sound on Oct. 29. Greenspan said O'Leary's legal team will make the appearance on her behalf.  ",entertainment
324,Vancouver artist Stan Douglas wins $100K Audain Prize,"A Vancouver artist known for his photo, film and video installations that examine social reality and history was awarded the Audain Prize on Monday night.  Stan Douglas, 58, was given the $100,000 cash prize before a packed ballroom at the Vancouver Club.   ""The award raises the profile of visual art in the city, which has not always had the highest profile, even though we have really extraordinary artists who live and work here,"" Douglas told the crowd, calling the award ""a great honour.""  ""The best is yet to come.""  Douglas was born in Vancouver and studied at Emily Carr University. One of his most celebrated pieces sits in the city's historic Woodward's building, a 15-metre photo mural depicting the Gastown Riot on Aug. 7, 1971.  ""His ongoing inquiry into technology's role in image-making, and how those mediations infiltrate and shape collective memory, has resulted in works that are at once specific in their historical and cultural references and broadly accessible,"" reads an online biography.    Michael Audain, founder of the Audain Art Museum, which administers the prize, called Douglas one of the world's leading contemporary artists.  ""I think we should be proud throughout the province of these cultural heroes,"" said Audain in an interview Tuesday morning on CBC's The Early Edition.  The Audain Foundation also announced Monday the funding of five travel awards worth $7,500 each for students in university-level visual arts programs in B.C.  The foundation said it has issued more than $120 million in grants since it was established in 1997 to support the visual arts, mainly in B.C.    It said the foundation now includes grants for wildlife conservation, with a special emphasis on grizzly bears.  The Audain Prize is one of three annual, six-figure Canadian cash arts awards, the other two being the Giller Prize, celebrating excellence in Canadian fiction, and the Sobey Art Award for a contemporary Canadian artist under the age of 40.",entertainment
325,Toronto to host the 2021 Juno Awards,"The Juno Awards are coming back to Toronto in 2021, after a decade away from the city where the show began.  In a news release, the Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (CARAS) says the show will celebrate 50 years of Canadian music at Scotiabank Arena on Sunday, March 28, 2021 and will be aired live on CBC.   The show will be put on with the support of both the City of Toronto and the province of Ontario.  Allan Reid, president and CEO of CARAS, the Juno Awards and MusiCounts, calls it an honour to bring Canada's biggest music event back to the city where it originated.  ""This is an amazing city. It's a great music city, and a decade is almost too long,"" Reid told CBC Radio's Metro Morning on Tuesday. ""Obviously this is a major celebration, the 50th anniversary, and we felt there was no better place to celebrate that than right here in Toronto.""  He said Canada continues to produce some of the world's most vibrant artists, such as Shawn Mendes, Drake, Alessia Cara and The Weeknd.  ""Not since the '90s probably when Celine [Dion] and Shania [Twain] and Sarah [McLachlan] and Alanis [Morissette] dominated the charts have Canadians literally dominated globally,"" Reid said Tuesday.    It was in 1970 that creators Walt Grealis and Stan Klees put on the first Juno Awards show in Toronto at St. Lawrence Hall. In its first year, it was called the Gold Leaf Awards but was then changed to the Junos to honour Pierre Juneau, the first president of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission.  The Juno Awards were hosted in Toronto for its first 20 consecutive years and five more times after that. Since then, the awards show has been filling up venues all across Canada, from St. John's, NL, to Vancouver, B.C.   Mayor John Tory said Toronto is proud to have the opportunity to host the event for its 50th anniversary, calling it ""the biggest event in Canadian music.""   ""Ontario's amazing artists, industry professionals and emerging talent exemplify that we offer the world in one province,"" said Lisa MacLeod, Ontario's minister of Tourism, Culture and Sport.   Toronto itself is known for its rich music scene that has produced some of the most famous artists in the world, like Drake. While he is no longer submitting his albums to the Canadian awards show for consideration, the Junos hope to mend the relationship and have him back at the event.    Reid said he has ""put out an invitation"" to Drake's representatives, hoping to set up a conversation about getting the superstar back into the fold.  ""We would love to have Drake come back to the Junos,"" Reid said. ""No question. He's an incredible artist.""   Meanwhile, applications overall have doubled, Reid said, with 2,800 artists submitting their work for nomination consideration last year.  ""That means amazing music is being made from coast to coast to coast across this country,"" Reid said. ""The industry has a tough decision deciding who are going to be the nominees and who are going to be the winners.""    Host cities of the awards show have seen an average of over $10 million in economic impact with the combination of the awards broadcast, Juno Week and surrounding events, since 2002.",entertainment

327,Soulpepper Theatre to relaunch training residency,"The Soulpepper Theatre Company says it plans to relaunch its training program after putting it on hold last year in the wake of sexual-harassment allegations.  The Toronto-based non-profit says it hopes to accept a new class of actors, designers, directors, and playwrights to join the Soulpepper Academy next fall. The admissions process is set to kick off this spring, pending confirmation of government funding and donations.  The academy was put on hiatus while Soulpepper conducted a review of the program and looked for new leadership. Company co-founder Albert Schultz stepped down as artistic director in January 2018, vowing to vigorously defend himself in a sexual-harassment lawsuit filed by four actresses.  In August 2018, all parties said they had reached an out-of-court settlement, the terms of which have not been disclosed.    The academy is expected to resume under the leadership of Soulpepper's new artistic director, Weyni Mengesha.  The Toronto troupe is also launching a program in January that offers patrons aged 25 and under two free same-day tickets to mainstage and concert productions. Every morning, the remaining tickets to that day's performances will be made available online to young theatre-goers, who are welcome to bring a guest of any age.  The initiative was announced Monday as Soulpepper unveiled its programming for January to August 2020.  Highlights include Mengesha's direction of Jesus Hopped the 'A' Train, written by Pulitzer Prize winner Stephen Adly Guirgis, and the Canadian premiere of Roland Schimmelpfennig's Winter Solstice, directed by Alan Dilworth, with a cast featuring Soulpepper founding members Nancy Palk and Diego Matamoros.

328,"Emmy Awards: Surprises, upsets and memorable moments","A new queen of comedy, surprising upsets, a history-making award and the inevitable win for Game of Thrones: the 2019 Emmy Awards offered night of wins as fractured as the current TV landscape.  The hostless, three-hour show was both funny and head-scratching, depending on what point you tuned in.     Producers won some solid laughs by putting reliable performers such as Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Maya Rudolph and late-night hosts Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel onstage, but the decision to dispense with traditional voiceover narration and orchestra playing people onstage (in favour of comedian Thomas Lennon's commentary and contemporary tracks) made for some awkward moments.   Here are some Emmy highlights in a night dominated by wins for cable network HBO and streaming platforms Amazon and Netflix:  Fleabag's wins  Phoebe Waller-Bridge was the giant-slayer Sunday night, with the British writer, performer and creator scoring three trophies for her critically acclaimed Amazon series Fleabag, a dark comedy centred on what she called a ""dirty, pervy, messed up,"" London woman navigating life after tragedy.    Waller-Bridge won best writing in a comedy series early on, and eventually added best comedy and best lead actress in a comedy. The latter two categories were widely expected to go to the beloved and recently concluded satire Veep and its star Louis-Dreyfus. Waller-Bridge's wins in those categories blocked the Seinfeld alum from becoming the most decorated Emmy winner ever. Fleabag also won for its direction.   ""This is just getting ridiculous,"" the thoroughly delighted Brit declared upon winning the penultimate award of the night.    She also gets bonus points for her ties to another surprise winner: Waller-Bridge got a shout-out from Killing Eve's Jodie Comer (who won over her co-star, Canadian Sandra Oh, in the best lead actress in a drama category). Waller-Bridge served as head writer of the spy thriller's first season.  'I have the right to be here'  A striking addition to any red carpet, Billy Porter from FX's ball culture drama Pose made history as the first openly gay man to win the Emmy for best lead actor in a drama series. In his acceptance speech, he delivered a message that was both exuberant and powerful.    ""It took many years of vomiting up all the filth I'd been taught about myself, and half-believed, before I was able to walk on the earth as though I had a right to be here,"" Porter said, quoting writer and activist James Baldwin.  ""I have the right. You have the right. We all have the right.""  Sunday night's Emmy also puts the previous Tony- and Grammy-winner on the path toward EGOT status, with just an Academy Award left for Porter to win.  [PHOTOGALLERY]  'Listen to her'  It wouldn't be an award show without performers making impassioned pleas (Patricia Arquette took time to call out the persecution of trans people, while RuPaul urged Americans to vote). Fosseu002FVerdon star Michelle Williams addressed the issue of pay equity in accepting her award for best actress in a limited series or TV movie.  ""I see this [award] as an acknowledgement of what is possible when a woman is trusted to discern her own needs, feels safe enough to voice them, and respected enough that they will be heard,"" she said, adding that Fosseu002FVerdon's network FX ""understood that when you put value into a person, it empowers that person to get in touch with their own inherent value.    ""And where do they put that value? They put it into their work. And so when the next woman and especially a woman of colour — because she stands to make 52 cents on the dollar compared to her white, male counterpart — tells you what she needs in order to do her job: listen to her. Believe her.""   In 2017, the four-time Oscar nominee made headlines when it emerged that her All the Money in the World co-star Mark Wahlberg received $1.5 million (all figures U.S.) to do re-shoots for the drama, while she received less than $1,000.   ""The discrepancy … was so huge that it really illustrated a larger point. Not just for myself, obviously, but if it was this difficult for me — a white woman in a privileged industry — how difficult is it for women of colour across all industries?"" Williams added backstage in the Emmys press room.  ""While tonight is a kind of fairy-tale ending for me and for my own personal story, there really won't be any satisfaction for me until the larger message is heard.  The Exonerated Five  The Microsoft Theater erupted in cheers and a standing ovation when Jharrel Jerome was announced winner of best lead actor in a limited series for When They See Us, Ava DuVernay's series on the infamous Central Park Five case, in which five black and Latino teens were coerced into confessing to a rape they didn't commit.    The memorable Emmys moment acknowledged both young rising star Jerome's performance in the searing Netflix four-parter as well as the five exonerated men, who attended the awards show alongside Duvernay.  ""This is for Raymond, Yusef, Antron, Kevin, and King Korey Wise,"" Jerome declared.     'We shall never see its like again'  Perhaps an acknowledgement of the divisive final season of Game of Thrones, the sprawling fantasy epic didn't set a new record with how many trophies it added to its already mammoth haul for the previous seven seasons. Its dozen wins this year, largely awarded during last week's Creative Arts Emmys, tied the show's previous record for most Emmys won by a series in a single season.  Best writing and direction in a drama series — two major awards Game of Thrones has claimed in the past — went to HBO's Succession and Netflix's Ozark (respectively) in 2019.    Even the decision to unite the cast as Emmy presenters didn't go over as well as expected, with superfans noting the clutch of GoT actors at the ceremony not invited to share the stage.     Still, the legacy of the game-changing HBO series (and Peter Dinklage's indelible performance) proved insurmountable: the show was crowned best drama series and Dinklage picked up a fourth acting Emmy.  ""These last ten years have been the best years of our lives,"" showrunner David Benioff declared onstage.  ""I can't believe we finished it. I can't believe we did it all together and it's over. We shall never see its like again.""  And while ""You know nothing, Jon Snow"" became a popular Game of Thrones meme, the actor behind that character says he and his castmates knew the ending was right.    ""Everyone put all of their love and effort into [the final series],"" Kit Harington noted backstage.  ""I think for us, we knew what we were doing was right, story-wise. And that it was right for the characters because we lived with them for 10 years.""",entertainment

Audiences can enjoy the sounds of the 1960s and 70s in the concert-style The Simon &amp; Garfunkel Story and the musical Summer based on the life and music of disco diva Donna Summer, from American-Canadian director Des McAnuff and Colombian-born, Canadian-raised choreographer Sergio Trujillo.

An April run of Room, based on Irish-Canadian writer Emma Donoghue's 2010 novel, at the CAA Theatre.    Donoghue, who earned an Oscar nomination for her screenplay adaptation of Room, also transformed her story for the stage.  ""I just love to see what a new genre brings out in the same old story and so adaptation is a real pleasure for me,"" the London, Ont.-based writer told CBC News on Monday.  ""I'm really genuinely trying to transform my work and see what each new form can bring out in it.""    In addition to introducing songs, the forthcoming Room adaptation also made a key change to the protagonists  — one that Donoghue believes brings complexity to the story.  ""When we did the show first in Britain and Scotland and Dublin, we cast a woman of colour and a biracial kid and I have to say that brought out a whole new set of overtones to the role,"" she explained.  In addition to literally putting new face on the character of Ma following Brie Larson's Oscar-winning turn in the movie, this casting decision for the stage version ""makes you think of so many other contemporary situations of racism, human trafficking [and] the whole history of slavery, without it being all spelled out verbally,"" Donoghue said.  ""I now think that's a crucial part and we're doing the same thing for Canadian casting.""",entertainment
330,Placido Domingo to resume U.S. performances amid misconduct allegations,"When opera superstar Placido Domingo appeared in Europe last month after being accused of sexual harassment by multiple women, his performances were greeted with rapturous ovations.  This week, the spotlight moves to the U.S., where Domingo faces two investigations into his behaviour and is scheduled to help kick off the new season at New York's Metropolitan Opera. Companies in three other American cities have cancelled his performances due to the allegations.  Wednesday's appearance in Macbeth marks the legendary tenor's first performance in the U.S. since the publication of two Associated Press stories in which numerous women said he sexually harassed them or engaged in other inappropriate behaviour, including one soprano who said he grabbed her bare breast under her robe.  Domingo has called the allegations ""in many ways, simply incorrect,"" without providing any specifics.    Domingo is general director of LA Opera, which has engaged outside counsel to conduct its investigation. He also is being investigated by the American Guild of Musical Artists, the union representing many opera employees.  The Met has said it will wait for the results of the LA Opera investigation before deciding on any action against Domingo, who is scheduled to perform at the storied opera house seven times this season.  Emotional, heated meeting at The Met  The Met's general manager, Peter Gelb, held a one-hour meeting with chorus singers and orchestra musicians after a dress rehearsal Saturday to discuss the Mets' position on the allegations.  In characterizing the meeting, Gelb said, ""I said we took the allegations very seriously. For some people, allegations are enough to warrant actions, but the Met as an institution does not believe it can take action until there is corroborated evidence, which has so far not been the case.""  Gelb said he also noted the Met was closely monitoring the two investigations and ""we are prepared to take action when action is merited.""  One musician who attended the meeting and spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation described the session as heated and often emotional.  Some staff members were visibly emotional as they challenged Gelb, the musician said, with at least one telling him, ""This is exactly why women don't come forward."" But one female chorus member spoke up in support of the Met's position, the musician noted.  Several attendees complained the Met was being inconsistent, referring to the 2018 firing of its famed conductor, James Levine, amid accusations that he had sexually abused several men when they were teenagers. The company initially suspended Levine in 2017 after the allegations surfaced and then severed ties with him after conducting its own investigation.  Domingo was not at the staff meeting, but did participate in a previously scheduled sexual harassment seminar last week with fellow cast members, according to a Met staff member with direct knowledge of the meeting, who spoke on condition of anonymity for the same reasons.  Music workers union investigates  The AGMA launched its own investigation after saying it couldn't be certain that opera companies would thoroughly investigate the allegations or make their findings public.  The union's national executive director, Len Egert, told the AP that AGMA hopes its inquiry can be wrapped up ""in a couple of months.""  He said he could not provide details, but indicated the union also is taking on board the wider problem of misconduct across the industry and the fear of retaliation by men in positions of power.    ""In addition to what we have done so far, AGMA will continue to search for and implement methods to change the culture,"" he said.  Domingo is scheduled to appear in three performances of Macbeth, two of them opposite the soprano Anna Netrebko, and then return to the Met for four performances of Madama Butterfly in November.  Outside the Met, Domingo's next scheduled U.S. performance is not until February, with LA Opera, which has not said how long it expects its investigation to last.  Three major American companies — the Philadelphia Orchestra, the San Francisco Opera and Dallas Opera — cancelled upcoming concerts starring Domingo after the AP stories were published.  None of Domingo's upcoming performances in Europe have been cancelled; he has a busy fall lineup of operas and concerts in Switzerland, Russia, Austria, Germany, Spain, Italy and Poland.    The most serious allegation against Domingo comes from soprano Angela Turner Wilson, now a voice teacher in the Dallas area, who said he forcefully grabbed her breast in a makeup room during a run at the Washington Opera in 1999.  The Washington Opera issued statements saying it has ""zero tolerance"" for harassment but did not receive any ""documented complaints"" about Domingo's behaviour during his 15 years as artistic director and general director of the company. It has declined to comment on whether it plans any investigation.  LA Opera inquiry continues  During its inquiry, the LA Opera — which Domingo helped found in the 1980s, and where several accusations of sexual misconduct occurred — has removed Domingo from day-to-day operations as general director, a post he has held since 2003.  The investigation is being led by Debra Wong Yang, a former U.S. attorney and Los Angeles County Superior Court judge, now a partner at the law firm of Gibson Dunn &amp; Crutcher.    In a statement emailed to the AP, a committee of LA Opera board members urged anyone with relevant information to contact Gibson Dunn and provide statements on the record, adding that, if requested, they ""will take reasonable efforts to keep the individual's identity as confidential as possible.""  The committee added that the LA Opera ""strictly prohibits retaliation of any kind against anyone participating in this investigation in good faith.""  The union also has said it will allow participants to remain anonymous if they request it.  Sexual harassment experts say allowing confidential reports is crucial to a thorough investigation because of the fear of retaliation in an insular industry like opera.",entertainment
331,"Fleabag wins big, Billy Porter makes history at Emmy Awards","Game of Thrones resurrected the Iron Throne at Sunday's Emmy ceremony, ruling as top drama on a night of surprises in which Pose star Billy Porter made history and the comedy series Fleabag led a British invasion that overturned expectations.  ""This all started in the demented mind of George R.R. Martin,"" said Game of Thrones producer David Benioff, thanking the author whose novels were the basis of HBO's fantasy saga.  Porter, who stars in the FX drama set in the LGBTQ ball scene of the late 20th century, became the first openly gay man to win a best drama series acting Emmy.  ""God bless you all. The category is love, you all, love. I'm so overjoyed and so overwhelmed to have lived to see this day,"" said an exuberant Porter, resplendent in a sparkling suit and swooping hat.  Amazon's Fleabag, a dark comedy about a dysfunctional woman, was honoured as best comedy and earned top acting honours for its British creator and star, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, and a best director trophy.  ""This is getting a ridiculous,"" Waller-Bridge said in her third trip to the stage to collect the top trophy.  Her acting win blocked Veep star Julia Louis-Dreyfus from setting a record as the most-honoured performer in Emmy history.  [PHOTOGALLERY]  ""Nooooo!"" a shocked-looking Waller-Bridge said as Louis-Dreyfus smiled for the cameras. ""Oh, my God, no. Thank you. I find acting really hard and really painful. But it's all about this,"" she said, her acting trophy firmly in hand.  In accepting the writing award earlier, she called the recognition proof that ""a dirty, pervy, messed-up woman can make it to the Emmys.""  Porter, a Tony and Grammy Award winning actor, relished his groundbreaking moment, quoting the late writer James Baldwin, Porter said it took him many years to believe he has the right to exist.  ""I have the right, you have the right, we all have the right,"" he said.    U.K. actress Jodie Comer was honoured as best drama actress for Killing Eve. She competed with Canadian co-star Sandra Oh, who received a Golden Globe for her role and would have been the first actress of Asian descent to win an Emmy in the category.  ""My mum and dad are in Liverpool [England] and I didn't invite them because I didn't think this was going to be my time. One, I'm sorry, two I love you,"" Comer said after saluting Oh.  Bill Hader won his second consecutive best comedy actor award for the hitman comedy Barry.  Peter Dinklage, named best supporting actor for Game of Thrones, set a record for most wins for the same role, four, breaking a tie with Aaron Paul of Breaking Bad.  ""I count myself so fortunate to be a member of a community that is about nothing but tolerance and diversity, because in no other place I could be standing on a stage like this,"" said Dinklage, a little person.    Ozark star Julia Garner won the best supporting drama actress trophy against a field including four actresses from Game of Thrones.  The auditorium erupted in cheers when Jharrel Jerome of When They See Us, about the Central Park Five case, won the best actor award for a limited series movie.  ""Most important, this is for the men that we know as the Exonerated Five,"" said Jerome, naming the five wrongly convicted men who were in the audience. They stood and saluted the actor as the crowd applauded them.  It was the only honour for the acclaimed Netflix series of the evening; Chernobyl won the best limited series honour.  Streaming hit new Emmy heights, powered by Amazon Prime winners Fleabag, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel and a Very English Scandal, and Netflix's Bandersnatch (Black Mirror), honoured as best movie. But HBO again showed its strength, including with the trophies for Chernobyl, Barry and John Oliver's best variety-talk win.  Calls to action  Michelle Williams, honoured as best actress for her portrayal of dancer Gwen Verdon in FX's limited series Fosseu002FVerdon, issued a call to arms for gender and ethnic equality.  She thanked the network and studio behind the project for ""supporting me completely and paying me equally because they understood ... when you put value into a person, it empowers that person to get in touch with their own inherent value. And where do they put that value, they put it into their work.""  ""And so the next time a woman and, especially a woman of colour, because she stands to make 52 cents on the dollar compared to her white male counterpart, tells you what she needs in order to do her job, listen to her,"" Williams said.    Patricia Arquette won the trophy best supporting limited-series or movie actress for The Act. She paid emotional tribute to her late trans sister, Alexis Arquette, and called for an end to prejudice against trans people, including in the workplace.  Ben Whishaw took the category's supporting actor trophy for A Very English Scandal, admitting in charming British fashion to a hangover.  Alex Borstein and Tony Shalhoub of The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel won best supporting acting awards at the ceremony, which included early and varied messages of female empowerment after the host-less ceremony kicked off with Homer Simpson.    ""I want to dedicate this to the strength of a woman, to [series creator] Amy Sherman-Palladino, to every woman on the Maisel cast and crew,"" Borstein said, and to her mother and grandmother. Her grandmother survived because she was courageous enough to step out of a line that, Borstein intimated, would have led to her death at the hands of Nazi Germany.  ""She stepped out of line. And for that, I am here and my children are here, so step out of line, ladies. Step out of line,"" said Borstein, who won the award last year.  Shalhoub added to his three Emmys which he earned for his signature series in Monk.  'Television has never been bigger'  The awards opened without a host as promised Sunday, with an early exchange pitting Ben Stiller against Bob Newhart.  ""I'm still alive,"" Newhart told Stiller, who introduced him as part of a wax museum comedy hall of fame that included Lucille Ball and other late legends.  Kim Kardashian West and Kendall Jenner drew some mocking laughter in the audience when they presented their award after Kardashian West said their family ""knows firsthand how truly compelling television comes from real people just being themselves.""    An animated Homer made a brief appearance on stage until he was abruptly crushed, with Anderson of Black-ish rushing in to, as he vowed, rescue the evening. He called Breaking Bad star Cranston on stage to tout the power of television from its beginning to the current golden age.  ""Television has never been bigger. Television has never mattered more. And television has never been this damn good,"" Cranston said.",entertainment
332,"DHX Media changing name to WildBrain, begins reorganizing company","DHX Media Ltd. is changing its corporate name to WildBrain, the name of its child-focused YouTube business, which will be renamed WildBrain Spark.  ""WildBrain Spark now averages more than three billion views per month,"" new DHX chief executive Eric Ellenbogen said Monday in his inaugural financial report to analysts.  The former president and chief executive of Marvel Enterprises also announced there will be a reorganization of the business to have a more simplified structure as it works to grow its audience while managing a large corporate debt.  Ellenbogen, who was named chief executive at DHX last month, said that it's not news that the company has faced ""some considerable challenges"" in recent years, but the changes Monday and others ahead will ""set the stage for a path forward.""     DHX Media to cut its debt with money from Peanuts deal with Sony: CEO    ""We continue to improve our financial position by generating positive operating cash flow in fiscal 2019 and paying down debt,"" Ellenbogen said.  However, Ellenbogen said repeatedly that he would be focused on long-term, sustainable growth for the company rather than quarter-to-quarter improvements.  He said that DHX has well-run business units, including WildBrain, a content creation business, and specialty television channels in Canada, but has yet to integrate them effectively.  ""It has barely begun to exploit the value of its entertainment assets,"" Ellenbogen said.    The proliferation of new streaming services also present DHX with many new opportunities, including its deal to create Peanuts programs for Apple's streaming service.  ""And to ensure we are poised to take advantage, we're planning to increase our spend against creative development,"" Ellenbogen said.  Some of the money for that increased spending, he said, will come from savings resulting from the business and management reorganization.  Chief operating officer Aaron Ames was appointed as chief financial officer to replace Doug Lamb, who has decided to step down but remain as an adviser to the Halifax-based company until the end of October.  DHX reported a fourth-quarter loss attributable to the company of $62.8 million or 47 cents per share on $108.8 million in revenue for the three months ended June 30.  The result compared with a loss of $21.6 million or 16 cents per share on $97.4 million in last year's fiscal fourth quarter.  MORE TOP STORIES:      ",entertainment
333,Jagmeet Singh politely challenges man who urged him to 'cut off' his turban,"A campaigning Jagmeet Singh had a public encounter today with a man in Montreal who urged the NDP leader to ""cut off"" his turban to ""look more like a Canadian.""  Singh was engaging prospective voters at Atwater Market this morning in front of media cameras and reporters when he was approached by the man.  After Singh shook his hand, the man leaned in and spoke to the NDP leader in English.  ""You know what? You should cut your turban off,"" he said. ""You'll look like a Canadian.""  ""Oh, I think Canadians look like all sorts of people,"" Singh replied. ""That's the beauty of Canada.""  ""Yeah, but..."" the man said — before Singh cut him off.  ""That's okay, I don't agree, sir,"" he said.  ""In Rome, you do as the Romans do,"" the man said.  ""Hey, but this is Canada, you can do whatever you like,"" Singh said, then walked away.  ""All right, take care, eh?"" the man called after him. ""I hope you win.""  Singh, the first member of a visible minority to lead a federal party, will take the stage tonight with Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau and Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet for the TVA  leaders' debate.  The four leaders are expected to address Quebec's Bill 21, which would prevent public employees from wearing religious symbols — such as Singh's turban — on the job.  Singh, who faces significant pressure to defend his party's seats in Quebec, already has said an NDP government wouldn't challenge Quebec's religious symbols law in court — but he hopes his own public identity can change Quebecers' minds about wearing religious symbols.     ""I'm a bearded, turbaned man that's going to Quebec and saying, 'I love the French language, I respect the unique identity of Quebec and I want to fight to defend it and I'm proud of who I am,'"" Singh said last month.

334,Ontario education workers' union says they'll strike Monday if no deal,"Some 55,000 education workers in Ontario are set to walk off the job Monday after their union said contract talks have stalled with seemingly little hope of reaching a deal.  CUPE's Ontario School Board Council of Unions announced the planned move during a news conference at Queen's Park on Wednesday morning.  Council president Laura Walton said she still hopes employers and the province will return to the bargaining table to prevent a walkout, and the union is prepared to do ""the hard work"" to avoid such a move.  ""Make no mistake — CUPE members are prepared to go on strike. We are ready,"" Walton told reporters. ""We are ready to do the hard work to prevent this action.""  Support staff, including clerical staff, custodians, educational assistants, early childhood educators and more from 63 school boards in the province, began a work-to-rule campaign Monday after last-minute, weekend contract talks failed to produce a deal.  Since Monday, Walton said, it has become clear to the union that job action is not leading to renewed talks and is affecting services in schools.  ""Across the province boards are cutting more services and putting students at greater risk,"" Walton said Wednesday. ""This is not safe and this is not sustainable. We have no choice but to invoke the next step in the legal progress we follow for school board bargaining.""    Despite the strike notice, Walton said, the union is inviting all sides to resume talks this week.   ""Even as we take this step, we are prepared to get a deal that will avoid strike action,"" Walton said. ""We are inviting the Council of Trustees Association and the [Ministry of Education] back to the table for some hard collaborative work.""  Early Wednesday afternoon, Education Minister Stephen Lecce said he thought all parties were fairly close to a deal when talks broke off on Sunday. He said the province has ""provided some latitude"" on issues such as job security and compensation, but also acknowledged sick days and extended leaves remain a sticking point.  ""I think we've demonstrated some reasonableness at the table,"" Lecce told reporters at Queen's Park early Wednesday afternoon.  Lecce cited retention of educational assistants as a priority, and said the government's actions through the current bargaining process have reflected that with offers of steady pay increases.   Walton acknowledged the province views worker absenteeism and use of sick days as a sticking point in the talks, and said the union is prepared to talk about the issues that lead to sick calls: high class sizes, classroom violence and excessive workloads, for example.   CUPE Ontario president Fred Hahn also noted at Wednesday's CUPE news conference that the education workers are among the lowest paid in the public education system, making an average of $38,000 per year.   As the union representatives did, Lecce expressed a willingness to resume talks and said negotiators for the province are ready to meet as early as today.  ""I remain cautiously optimistic"" a deal can be reached before a full-scale walkout, he said.  School boards are already sending notices to parents warning of a potential strike.  The York Region District School Board, just north of Toronto, is ""strongly"" encouraging parents to make child-care arrangements.  ""This strike action may result in school closures,"" said a notice from the board posted online. The Peel District School Board, just to the west of the city, issued a similar notice Wednesday.  'What we want here is pressure'  CUPE is just one of the unions locked in talks with Doug Ford's Progressive Conservative government.  So far, none has been able to reach a deal, raising concern that a widespread school strike could happen this fall.  Hahn said that should a full walkout occur on Monday, CUPE hopes teachers would opt not to cross the picket lines.  ""That would be ideal,"" Hahn said. ""What we want here is pressure to resolve these issues.""  Hahn was also asked about whether a strike would impact voting in the upcoming federal election, with hundreds of schools slated to serve as polling stations.  Hahn said Elections Canada will ""have to deal with that,"" but added that CUPE members ""won't impede the democratic process.""  ",politics
335,Andrew Scheer's claim about foreign aid deemed false,"The claim: ""The Trudeau government today sends $2.2 billion of so-called foreign aid to middle- and upper-income countries...Worse still, some of that money is shoveled to repressive regimes that are adversarial, if not outright hostile, to Canadian interests and values.""  -- Conservative leader Andrew Scheer announcing his proposal to slash 25 per cent of Canada's foreign aid budget and redistribute the money to taxpayers at home.  The facts: Ottawa spent a total of $6.098 billion on ""international assistance"" in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018, according to the latest statistical report from Global Affairs Canada.  Of that amount, $3.41 billion was spent directly on aid to other nations and $993.82 million was devoted to ""multilateral international assistance,"" benefiting more than one country or an entire region. In addition, other federal bodies like the Department of National Defence, the RCMP and Environment and Climate Change Canada spent a total of $858.43 million that falls under the ""foreign aid"" umbrella.  In Toronto on Tuesday, Scheer said he believes that the ""vast majority"" of Canada's foreign aid is ""well spent,"" but maintained that a ""significant chunk"" is being misdirected under Justin Trudeau. The Conservative leader specifically cited assistance to ""middle- and upper-income countries"" like Argentina, Barbados, Brazil, China, Italy, Mexico, and Turkey. And he identified ""hostile"" regimes like Iran, North Korea, and Russia as also being undeserving.  In total, those 10 countries received $22.03 million in Canadian assistance last fiscal year, mostly under multinational programs for international security, food assistance, or disaster relief. For instance, the $2 million that went to Italy was to help pay for rescue and recovery efforts after a 2017 earthquake.  It's not clear how the Tories arrived at their $2.2 billion figure. The party has said that they are defining ""middle- and upper-income countries"" as those with a score of 0.6 and above on the United Nations' Human Development Index (HDI). But that's not a benchmark that any other country or international body uses to determine which nations need assistance. And it seems like a rather arbitrary point within the HDI itself — about three-quarters of the way down the list of ""medium human development countries.""  Cut would be wide-ranging  If Canada were to adopt that cut-off it would mean that Ghana — ranked 140th of the 189 nations currently scored on the development index — would be the wealthiest country to qualify for our foreign aid. And it would disqualify five of Canada's top 20 aid recipients — Jordan, Bangladesh, Iraq, Lebanon and India — from future assistance.  Last fiscal year, those countries received a total of $387.55 million, $211 million of which was classified as emergency humanitarian aid, going mostly to support Syrian refugees in the Middle East and Rohingya Muslims who fled a genocidal regime in Myanmar.     During his Toronto speech, Scheer said that a Conservative government would continue to assist Ukraine — ranked 88th on the development index with a score of 0.751 — which received $54.51 million last year. But applying the 0.6 HDI mark would exclude every other European nation from Canadian assistance, as well as every country in Central and South America and every Caribbean nation except Haiti.  North African nations would no longer qualify for Canadian aid, nor would South Africa. And in the Middle East, only Syria and Yemen would make the grade. The list in Asia would be whittled down to Afghanistan — Canada's top foreign aid recipient at $237.97 million last year — Pakistan, Myanmar and Nepal.     That would account for the $1.5 billion that Scheer is promising to cut from the aid budget, but not the additional $700 million he claims the Trudeau government is wasting on well-to-do countries and corrupt dictatorships.   Experts say they are puzzled  Experts in the field are mystified by the Tory claims and their number crunching.   ""This is not the standard way of looking at country income classification. No one does it that way,"" says Aniket Bhushan, an adjunct research professor at Carleton University, who oversees the Canadian International Development Platform, a database that tracks aid spending. ""There's nothing in the empirical literature that says anything about 0.6 HDI.""    Bhushan says that Canada doesn't actually provide any official development assistance to high-income countries — they are excluded under agreed international definitions. (The cut off, as per this OECD eligibility list, is ""Upper Middle Income Countries,"" with per capita Gross National Incomes of between US $3,956 and $12,235 in 2016.)  And he suspects that the Conservatives are including the funds that go to multinational programs — some $2.4 billion in 2018 — and the money that Canada spends at home — like the $462.19 million that went to support newly arrived refugees last fiscal year — in their calculations of direct foreign aid.   'A Trump-like response'  ""It's all bizarre,"" says Bhushan. ""It's sort of a Trump-like response.""  But regardless of how it is justified, a 25 per cent cut to Canada's foreign aid would be a serious blow to the developing world, says Liam Swiss, a Memorial University sociologist who serves as president of the Canadian Association for the Study of International Development.  ""Fundamentally, you're talking about immunizing fewer children, more mothers dying in childbirth, less potable water and more refugees suffering in conflict zones. That's what it means in terms of Canada's aid,"" says Swiss.    And then there's the question of Canada's commitments to the international community.   It was Lester Pearson, the former prime minister, who helped the UN set a development spending target for wealthy nations — 0.7 per cent of GDP — back in 1970. It's a goal that Canada has been committed to for 50 years, but has never come close to attaining. At present, Ottawa's $6.1 billion aid budget is 0.28 per cent of GDP. The proposed Conservative cut would drop that figure to 0.21 per cent.  Not paying fair share now  ""We're already well below our fair share,"" says Nicolas Moyer, CEO of the Canadian Council for International Co-operation, an association representing aid organizations. ""We rank 15th in the OECD, and this would drop us to 19th, and make us second-last among G7 countries.""  Moyer says past Conservative governments have been strong leaders on foreign aid, citing the almost $3 billion that Stephen Harper devoted to child and maternal health initiatives.     And he's not sure why Andrew Scheer is talking about cuts.  ""Is it a signal that we're withdrawing from the rest of the world?"" asks Moyer. ""In an era of climate change, mass migration and challenges to the international order, Canada needs to engage more in the world, not less.""  The verdict: False. Scheer's claim that Canada is sending $2.2 billion to upper- and middle-income countries and corrupt dictatorships isn't supported by the numbers.

336,Border officers mistakenly gave RCMP passcodes to Meng Wanzhou's phone,"Canada Border Services Agency officers who seized Meng Wanzhou's phones, laptop and tablet when she arrived at Vancouver's airport in December 2018 later mistakenly gave the phone passcodes to the RCMP.  Lawyers for Canada's attorney general admitted the error in B.C. Supreme Court on Tuesday as they tried to shoot down a theory that the CBSA and RCMP had conspired to violate the Huawei chief financial officer's rights at the time of her arrest.  Meng's lawyers claim the agencies acted at the behest of the RCMP to conduct a ""covert criminal investigation"" against their client.  But Crown lawyer Diba Majzub told B.C. Supreme Court Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes that one error doesn't prove a larger conspiracy.  ""When we consider this part of the process, and the fact that there was an error — that has to be looked at in the entire context,"" said Majzub.  ""The fact of an error in the process is not an air of reality that the process was a sham.""  Accused of violating U.S. sanctions  The Crown has spent the past two days refuting the defence allegation that Meng was the victim of an abuse of process when she was screened and questioned by CBSA officers before being officially arrested on an extradition warrant.  American prosecutors want the 47-year-old sent to the U.S. to stand trial for allegedly violating U.S. sanctions against Iran by lying to banks about Huawei's control of a hidden subsidiary.    The company — which Huawei claimed was a ""local partner"" in Tehran — was accused of attempting to sell American telecommunications equipment in violation of the U.S. regulations.  Prosecutors claim Meng's alleged misrepresentations placed financial institutions at risk of breaking the law.  Meng is living under house arrest in a multimillion dollar home on Vancouver's West Side; she has denied the allegations.  Law allows CBSA to seize and search phones  Meng's extradition hearing is set to begin in January 2020, but this week her lawyers are trying to convince Holmes to issue an order for records to bolster their abuse of process claim.  The Crown has said the CBSA and RCMP acted appropriately, making sure that Meng was screened for admissibility before she was arrested.    Majzub argued that the law allows border officers to take phones from travellers, ask them for the passcodes and even to search them — all in the name of deciding if someone should be allowed into the country.  He said CBSA officers had legitimate reason to question Meng and to take her electronic devices because of the existence of fraud allegations which suggested she might be ineligible because of serious criminality.  Majzub said the law allows CBSA officers to search all ""goods"" crossing the border with travellers — and that the definition of ""goods"" includes cellphones.  'They did not access the devices'  Meng was carrying an iPhone 7 Plus, an IPad Pro, a Macbook Air and a Huawei Mate 20 phone when CBSA officers met her on the jetway after she landed in Vancouver on arrival from Hong Kong.  According to the defence, the FBI had asked that the devices be immediately seized and placed in special bags designed to ensure that their contents could not be remotely wiped.    The CBSA officers who took the phones also compelled Meng to give them the passcodes.  The Crown lawyers claim the devices have never been searched, but were passed to police by mistake.  In an email included in an affidavit filed with the court, Vancouver airport CBSA chief of passenger operations Nicole Goodman said she wrote to the RCMP after learning of the error.  ""I advised the RCMP the passcodes should not have been provided by CBSA as the passcodes were CBSA information obtained during the CBSA examination, and that the passcodes could not be used to access the devices nor shared with a third party (ie. other law enforcement agency),"" Goodman wrote.  ""The RCMP confirmed they did not access the devices, and do not intend to access the devices at any time as it was not their investigation.""  'Not a deliberate action'  In order to reach a decision, Holmes has to decide whether there is an ""air of reality"" to the theory the defence has put forward — not whether a conspiracy actually exists.  Holmes asked Majzub what he had to say about the fact the passcodes were passed between the agencies.  He asked her to consider the extraordinary powers of the CBSA and their duties to screen passengers thoroughly, suggesting that any mistake considered out of context can be misleading.  ""When Your Ladyship does that, the result should be the conclusion that that was not a deliberate action but an error,"" Mazjub said.  Meng has attended the proceedings in person, walking past a phalanx of cameras daily as she leaves her home to head to the downtown courthouse each morning.    According to the court documents, Meng owns homes in both Hong Kong, where protestors have been marching against authoritarian rule and in Shenzhen in Mainland China, where Huawei has its headquarters.  As China marked the 70th anniversary of Communist rule with a show of force, Meng wore a Chinese flag pin on a long red dress which hung just above the ankle monitor she wears as part of her release.  The court proceedings are expected to last all week.",politics
337,"No easy fix for Roxham Road crossings, says refugee advocate","Two years after asylum seekers began pouring into Quebec at Roxham Road, north of Plattsburgh, N.Y., dozens still step across the border at that unauthorized crossing every day, despite the Liberal government's attempt to stop them.  The Liberals included a new provision in an omnibus bill last April, barring anyone from applying for asylum in Canada if they had already done so in one of the so-called Five Eyes countries which Canada shares intelligence with: Australia, New Zealand, the U.S. and the U.K.  At the time, Border Security Minister Bill Blair said the intent of the provision was to curb what he referred to as would-be asylum seekers ""shopping around,"" making claims in multiple countries.  ""If people are pursuing their claims in the United States, we wanted them to understand that they should stay there, because that's a safe place, and to pursue their claim in that place,"" Blair told CBC News recently.  Despite that change in the law, the latest figures from the government show that at least 9,965 people were intercepted by the RCMP crossing into Quebec by land this year — only ten fewer people than this time last year. At least 3,547 of them crossed after the provision came into effect in June.  On Sept. 29 alone, 65 asylum seekers were intercepted crossing into Quebec, according to the provincial Immigration Ministry.    The provision has also had unintended consequences. Canada has placed a moratorium on deportations to Haiti, leaving Haitian asylum seekers stranded here, unable to proceed with their asylum claims and therefore unable to obtain services and financial assistance from the federal government.  These are the kinds of problems that the Montreal-based Canadian Council for Refugees flagged when the Liberals introduced the change to the law last spring.  ""It was rushed through and not given proper study because it was part of the budget bill,"" said Janet Dench, the council's executive director. ""People are living the consequences for this poorly conceived piece of legislation.""    Blair, who is seeking re-election in Scarborough Southwest, stands by the provision. In an interview with CBC News, he said the Liberal government wanted claimants to know that they ""put themselves at a disadvantage"" when they abandon a claim in the U.S. to make one in Canada.  Blair would not say if the provision is working as intended.  Human rights and immigration issues will be the topics of debate when the federal leaders go head-to-head on Oct. 7 and 10.  Here are how the other federal parties intend to address the asylum-seeker issue, if elected.  Conservative Party  The Conservatives did not respond to a CBC News request for comment on whether a Conservative-led government would change the Liberals' Five Eyes provision.  The party told CBC News that it would close what it sees as a loophole in the existing Safe Third Country agreement negotiated between Canada and the U.S., ""in order to preserve a fair, orderly and compassionate immigration system.""     Under that treaty, a refugee claimant must make a claim in the first ""safe country"" they arrive in. That means asylum seekers who come into Canada from the U.S. are turned away at an official Canadian port of entry.  However, anyone seeking asylum is still allowed to make a claim if they can land on Canadian soil. That's why so many asylum seekers have crossed into Canada illegally, at places such as Roxham Road, to make their claims once they are apprehended by the RCMP on the Canadian side.    Conservative immigration critic Michelle Rempel has suggested making the entire length of the border an official port of entry, meaning that the Safe Third Country rule would apply no matter where asylum seekers crossed.   It's a solution Dench calls ""absolutely absurd,"" since Canadian and U.S. citizens are often asked to present themselves to a port of entry — which in this case, could be anywhere along the border, under Rempel's proposal.  ""I haven't heard anybody spell it out in a way that could possibly be viable,"" Dench said.    Dench said the Conservatives also need to consider that ""you can't just unilaterally change an agreement"" with another country.  The People's Party of Canada also suggested making the entire length of the border an official port of entry, as well as fencing off portions ""where illegal border jumping is prevalent,"" such as Roxham Road.  New Democratic Party  The New Democratic Party says it would suspend the Safe Third Country agreement, if elected. If the treaty was suspended, asylum seekers could present themselves at any official border crossing to apply for refugee status.  In a statement to CBC News, the NDP said it would suspend the Liberal government's Five Eyes provision, as well.  ""This is another example of the Liberals closing Canada's borders to vulnerable asylum seekers who are fleeing for their lives,"" the party said in its statement.  ""Canada has international obligations under the UN Refugee Convention and we must continue to provide protection to those who need it. We also have to ensure any changes to our asylum system are not buried in an omnibus budget bill.''    Green Party  Like the NDP, the Green Party said it would suspend the Safe Third Country agreement with the U.S.   While Dench agrees that Canada should withdraw from the agreement ""because the U.S. clearly is not a safe country for all refugees,"" she also said it may not have a tangible impact.    ""At the moment, anybody who does actually want to cross into Canada can very easily find out that they can do so at Roxham Road,"" she said.  ""So it's not even clear that suspending the agreement would make much difference in terms of the total number of people that would be coming to Canada and making a refugee claim.""  As far as the Five Eyes provision is concerned, the Green Party said that right now, the U.S. alone is ""violating rights.""  ",politics
338,"At Trudeau event, Toronto-area mayors say Liberal firearms policy doesn't go far enough","Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau had mayors from the Greater Toronto Area on hand Tuesday as he touted his party's vow to crack down on firearms — but all those assembled suggested the federal government should go further and promise a handgun ban.  After Trudeau delivered a speech extolling the virtues of banning semi-automatic ""assault"" rifles as a means to reduce gun-related crime, a reporter asked all the mayors — including leaders from major suburbs like Mississauga and Markham — to raise their hands if they'd support a national ban on handguns. They all did.  ""I can tell you I heard clearly from [the mayors] that many of them want us to bring a national [handgun] ban,"" Trudeau said afterward.  While rejecting the idea of a national ban, Trudeau promised a re-elected Liberal government would give individual municipalities the authority to ban or restrict handguns on their own.  But the reaction of the assembled mayors to a signature Liberal campaign pledge shows that some municipalities want Ottawa to do much more.  ""We would obviously prefer that the handgun ban be national. They're not prepared to go forward right now,"" Mississauga Mayor Bonnie Crombie told reporters after the event. ""But they have introduced other measures, including funding, enhanced funding, that will go directly to the cities and they are banning semi-automatic assault weapons.""  Asked why his party would pursue a limited ban instead of one covering handguns, Trudeau punted the question. ""We are taking the strongest step in Canadian history to move forward on tougher gun legislation,"" he replied.  NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh also has proposed giving municipalities the power to ban handguns. Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer has said these policies would do little reduce gun violence because they target legal firearms owners instead of criminals. Scheer has promised what he's calling a tough-on-crime approach to gangs, including new bail restrictions and longer sentences for gang-related offences.  Instead of a cross-country handgun ban, the Liberal Party has promised to pursue a ban on ""military-style assault rifles"" like those used in recent mass shootings in the U.S.  ""These guns are designed to inflict mass casualties and have no place in Canada. Canadians are tired of excuses and know that 'thoughts and prayers' don't make our communities any safer,"" the Liberal platform reads.    Most gun-related homicides in Canada — 65.3 per cent of the total in 2018, according to Statistics Canada — are carried out with handguns.  While police don't have accurate data on the origin of crime guns, hundreds of guns are confiscated by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) every year as gang members procure illegal firearms from the U.S. to carry out their crimes.  'Military' and 'assault' style firearms to be banned  The Liberals haven't said which firearms would be classified as ""military"" or ""assault"" style according to their policy. As it stands, those terms have no legal definitions.  Trudeau said Tuesday he'd rely on the advice of experts to determine ""which guns are which.""  A re-elected Liberal government would offer owners of such military-style weapons a ""buyback program"" at ""fair market prices"" for firearms legally purchased in Canada.  There are more than a million restricted and prohibited firearms in Canada. But not all of them are considered ""assault"" weapons — making it very difficult to estimate the potential cost of a buyback program.  For a similar program, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern earmarked $125 million to buy back about 175,000 firearms in that country.    Canada's current classifications are based not on how menacing a particular firearm looks but rather largely on its physical characteristics.  For example, all handguns and some semi-automatic firearms are already classified as ""restricted"" under Canadian firearms law, meaning they must be registered with the provincial chief firearms officer.  To legally own a restricted firearm, an owner must go through a lifetime background check — which can take months — complete a weekend training course and then pass a test to be eligible for a possession and acquisition license (PAL) with restricted privileges.  After passing the test and buying a firearm, the owner must then also obtain an Authorization to Transport (ATT) from the firearms officer each time they want to carry the gun to any place other than a government-approved gun range.  A person can only legally shoot a restricted firearm if they have a license, or if they're under the direct supervision of an adult who has one of their own.    Moreover, under existing Canadian law, high-capacity magazines — which have been used south of the border in multiple mass shootings — are illegal already. So are fully automatic firearms that can unleash a flurry of bullets in seconds.  When asked Tuesday why he's principally focused on firearms that are used less often in homicides, Trudeau pointed out there's still a grim history of violence associated with such weapons — the 1989 Polytechnique massacre and the 2017 Quebec City mosque shooting being the better-known examples.  ""We need to strengthen gun control in this country. And the choice is clear. Liberals are going to strengthen gun control. Conservatives want to weaken gun control,"" he said.",politics
339,Scheer promises to slash foreign aid spending by 25 per cent,"A Conservative government would slash Canada's foreign aid spending by 25 per cent, withholding international assistance from what the party is calling ""middle- and upper-income countries as well as hostile regimes.""  Speaking in Toronto, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said he would use the $1.5 billion in savings to pay for other policies in the Conservatives' yet-to-be-released platform.  He's also promising to redirect $700 million toward aid for the world's poorest countries, with an additional focus on children in conflict zones.  The Conservatives are defining ""middle- and upper-income countries"" as those with a Human Development Index above 0.6, which includes Argentina, China and Barbados. The United Nations figure measures life expectancy, education and standard of living and was created to assess the overall development of a country, not economic growth alone.    Scheer also went after the Liberals for giving aid dollars to Iran, North Korea and Russia. Canada gives money to a number of programs run by a number of international groups in those countries to cover programs that include fighting tuberculosis, strengthening the rule of law and providing loans to help women start small businesses.  Between early 2015 and 2017, Canada donated close to $900,000 to help fund a UNESCO study of the education system in Iran. The funding started under Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper and helped identify ""effective education policy reforms and models of best practice.""  ""At a time when Canadians are working harder than ever and not getting ahead, Trudeau is using their hard-earned tax dollars to support anti-Semitic organizations and prop up foreign dictatorships,"" Scheer said.  ""It is time for Canada to put our money where our mouth is and only use foreign aid to support the Canadian values we hold dear.""  Scheer said today that Tuesday's announcement would not affect groups receiving aid to provide abortion and maternal health services to women and girls abroad.  ""We are not reopening this debate at any level. What this is about is which types of countries will receive financial assistance. And so, groups that are receiving funding will continue to receive funding going in future,"" he said.  ""This decision does not affect groups or programs going forward.""  Scheer blasted Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau's record on the world stage, citing his opponent's trip to India and his ""gushing"" praise for Fidel Castro.    The National's face-to-face interviews  CBC is hosting a series of face-to-face interviews between undecided voters and federal leaders campaigning for next month's election.   How to watch: Watch the interviews on CBC News Network starting at 8 p.m. ET Watch on the CBC News App or CBC Gem at 8 p.m. ET Watch on The National at 10 p.m. on CBC TV across the country.    Scheer was asked whether the cuts could affect Canada's bid for a seat on the UN Security Council. ""It's more important to me that I help Canadians get ahead than curry favour at the United Nations,"" he replied. ""That is our priority. That is our focus.""    During his announcement, Scheer also committed to providing additional support to Ukraine and using Canada's Magnitsky law to target countries like Iran. That law allows the Canadian government to impose sanctions and travel bans on foreign officials responsible for human rights violations.  According to Global Affairs, Canada spent more than $6 billion on international assistance during the 2017-2018 fiscal year. The top five recipients were Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Mali and Nigeria.  While the rich members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (of which Canada is a member) have agreed to spent 0.7 per cent of gross national income on aid, Canada spends about 0.28 per cent.    The Canadian Council for International Co-operation, an umbrella group that represents many Canadian development groups, put out a statement expressing concerns about Scheer's announcement.  ""International development and humanitarian assistance are important parts of Canada's global leadership that contribute to visible impacts,"" the CCIC said in a statement.  ""For example, South Korea went from a major aid recipient to an important trading partner for Canada and the world. In as little as 25 years, Rwanda, after suffering a vicious genocide, has gone from crisis to develop into a model of economic development for many on the African continent.""  ",politics
340,"Amid global unrest, Canada's political parties say little about security, defence","In order to know what most of the major parties think about the uncertain state of the world, and Canada's place in it, you have to dig — really dig — to find it.  The ideas, solutions and proposals around security and defence from the Liberals, New Democrats and the Green Party  are buried, in some cases, at the very back of their platform documents. The Conservatives released their detailed platform plank on Tuesday.  The relative positioning of the policy pitches  — along with the dearth of debate about the turbulence beyond the country's borders — has alarmed defence policy experts who say now is not the time for politics as usual.  ""This is the time we need the clearest, most strategic thinking since the end of the Second World War, in terms of how we do Canadian security,"" said Rob Huebert, a defence expert at the University of Calgary. ""It is not an exaggeration to say we are on the cusp of the most dangerous geopolitical environment we've seen in our lifetime.""    The rise of authoritarianism throughout the globe, notably in China and Russia, and the undermining of Western democracies through a variety of circumstances has increased the likelihood of conflict in the eyes of many experts.    The retreat of the United States from its traditional role in the globe has enormous consequences for Canadian domestic policy.   Yet, Huebert said, there is ""a total lack of meaningful discussion about the type of direction we need to be taking"" by the Liberals and the other parties in the campaign.      I'm surprised every political party in this country has been muted on these topics  - Dave Perry, Canadian Global Affairs Institute     The conventional Canadian political calculus is that issues of security and defence policy are not vote-getters and previous elections, with one or two exceptions, have borne out that notion with ballot box issues being defined by either social or pocketbook considerations.  Huebert, however, describes it as a ""very disturbing calculation"" at this moment in time.  He is not alone in his concern.  ""There's a lot going on, but near radio silence,"" said Dave Perry, a senior analyst at the Canadian Global Affairs Institute. ""I'm surprised every political party in this country has been muted on these topics.""  The Liberal platform, released Sunday, recycles the title of their marquee defence policy, delivered in 2017 — Strong, Secure and Engaged.  The new campaign document's foreign policy and defence section is titled: ""Keeping Canada Strong, Secure and Engaged,"" and offers up as a pledge to ""renew Canada's commitment to peacekeeping efforts,"" which harkens back to the Liberal election platform in 2015.       ""To ensure that Canada continues to make a positive contribution to international peace and security, we will move forward with new investments to support United Nations peacekeeping efforts — with more help to advance the women, peace, and security agenda; support conflict prevention and peacebuilding; and respond to grave human rights abuses,"" said the Liberal 2019 platform.   The document does not explain what the new investment might look like, but the Liberals say they're committed to spending additional $50 million per year on UN peacekeeping commitments.  Liberal commitment in 2019 echoes 2015  However, Walter Dorn, a professor of defence studies at the Canadian Forces College and one of the country's preeminent experts on peacekeeping, said he finds the overall language of the Liberal promise curious.  ""Those were the same words used by Liberals in 2015,"" he said. ""So, are they renewing it because they haven't done it in the last four years?""  Dorn said the Liberal government, for a variety of reasons, did not get substantially engaged in peacekeeping during its mandate. It made a number of splashy commitments at an international meeting in Vancouver in 2017, but only delivered a year-long deployment of helicopters to Mali and the more recent secondment of a C-130J Hercules transport for United Nations operations in Africa.  ""I hope they can learn from their first term,"" said Dorn. ""Their performance is going to have to be much better if they're going to renew Canada's commitment to peacekeeping and secure a seat on the [UN] Security Council.""  He also noted the ""average number"" of uniform personnel deployed in UN peacekeeping missions under the Liberals was lower than during the former Conservative government era.  There's a promise in the Liberal platform to focus international military training activities to include instruction for other countries on how to respond to ""disasters due to climate change.""  NDP, Greens light on detail  The NDP's platform, released weeks ago, also leans heavily on peacekeeping, but also promises to work toward nuclear disarmament.  The Green Party makes a similar pledge, but also nods tentatively toward the instability beyond our borders.   ""Canada now needs a general purpose, combat-capable force that can provide realistic options to the government in domestic security emergencies, continental defence and international operations,"" said the Green's recently released platform.    The Conservatives promised on Tuesday to buy new submarines, join the U.S. ballistic missile defence program,  expand the current military mission in Ukraine, take the politics out of military procurement and lease a second supply ship for the navy.  Some of their proposals are revivals or retreads of previous Conservative policies. For example, the party is proposing to share RADARSAT-2 images with Ukraine — a policy the previous government embraced that was dropped by the Liberals.  The Conservatives also pledge to buy replacements for Canada's aging CF-18s fighter aircraft — something they would be required to do anyway because the Liberals issued a tender call last summer.    The Liberal platform pays specific attention to the Arctic, but within a foreign policy context promising to ""strengthen continental defence"" and in the North, moving ""forward with better developed surveillance and rapid response capabilities.""  Huebert was left scratching his head.  ""That blurs together so many talking points, it creates a sense of nothingness,"" he said.  There is no mention of NORAD modernization, including the planned replacement of the North Warning System chain of radar stations, a cost-shared endeavour with the United States that some experts have estimated could cost up to $11 billion (with Canadian taxpayers on the hook for 40 per cent or roughly $5 billion of that bill.)  Huebert said, when the Liberals talk about ""rapid response capabilities,"" they're referring to better search and rescue coverage in the North, something he said will become a necessity as more and more regions become ice-free in the summer.  ""Problem is: We just don't know what they're talking about,"" he said.  A Liberal campaign spokeswoman said the party understands how crucial it is to support the Canadian military and pointed to the government's defence policy as well as all of the social improvements that have been made for serving members.  ""Our platform lays out our vision for moving our country forward and how we plan to build on the progress we have made over the past four years,"" said Eleanore Catenaro.  Canada supported the UN with ""real capabilities,"" she said, adding that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau addressed the uncertainty in the world in a foreign policy speech at the end of August.  New framework for intelligence  Interestingly, the platform specifically promises to create ""a new framework governing how Canada gathers, manages and uses defence intelligence.""  That caught the attention of Perry who said the promise was likely red-circled by officials at the Department of National Defence.  Few Canadians realize that the military is home to the largest intelligence organization in the federal government, in terms of sheer numbers.   Precise figures are hard to establish, but the defence intelligence establishment is believed to be the country's second-best-funded intelligence organization  The National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians, earlier this year, signalled it wanted to see the military's intelligence branch put on a tighter legislative leash, similar to legal constraints on civilian spy agencies.  The committee recommended the Liberal government think seriously about drafting specific laws to govern how and under what circumstances military intelligence missions can take place.    The Liberal platform promises to create a specific defence procurement agency, which is curious in the sense that a series of government ministers and senior officials have lauded how well military procurement has been going since the Liberals came to power.  ""There is a bit of a disconnect here,"" said Perry. ""The message [with the platform promise] is that you're not happy with the way procurement has gone and you want it to go differently, better or make some substantive change.""

341,'The personal touch': Why lawn signs survive in the digital age,"When election signs started sprouting in his neighbourhood, Stan Gallant decided to jump on the bandwagon.   He commissioned his own custom sign for the front yard of his St. Albert, Alta., home.  It carries his name, a graphic of a glass filled with red wine and the slogan: ""Not running for anything. Just wanted a sign.""  It was meant as a joke, to lighten the mood and have a laugh, said Gallant, a real estate sales representative.  ""It cracks up the neighbours,"" he said. ""It was, in no way, meant to put down the political process. It's just a sign.""  But in the race to the ballot box, a lawn sign is never just a sign. Common in every race and at every level of politics, it's considered a powerful campaign tool.  There's a reason these relics have stubbornly survived the digital age, said Zain Velji, a political strategist with the Calgary firm Northweather.  Signs work  They work.  ""A thousand years of marketing history shows, awareness matters,"" Velji said in an interview with CBC Radio's Edmonton AM.  ""If every sale was directed by a Facebook ad, every company would be successful constantly. And we know that's not the case.""   Political candidates rely on campaign signs for name recognition. And not every sign is equal in the eyes of political strategists, Velji said.  Lawn signs on private property are the most prized, and convey a powerful message to anyone passing by.       We make decisions based on trust and the people around us.   - Zain Velji     ""They broadcast your opinions to the people closest to you, and campaigns know that,"" Velji said. ""So they put a disproportionate time and energy into it.""  ""For a campaign, they don't have the resources to reach out to every single person, regardless of their ambition. So having someone to take on that responsibility, it's a very overt message.  ""And we make decisions based on trust and the people around us.""     Coveted real estate  There is a strategy around earning the best real estate for lawn signs, said Duane Bratt, a political scientist at Mount Royal University.  Campaign teams will identify key streets and the busiest intersections within given ridings and do their best to earn the support of voters living on those coveted spots.  ""There are particular houses, particularly on corner lots, that are seen as more valuable,"" Bratt said. ""They've identified key intersections, key homes.  Bratt helped conduct two studies on lawn signs, counting each one in a given riding. The surveys were conducted in key battleground ridings in Calgary during the 2014 provincial byelection and the 2015 federal race.  The counts showed lawn signs are a key predictor of who will ultimately win, Bratt said.   ""You often hear, 'Signs don't matter.' But they really do matter on private land,"" he said.   ""There is a reason parties continue to door knock and put up signs, even if it takes a lot of time and money.""      Engineered-in-Edmonton Twitter bot combats misogyny on the campaign trail   What campaign songs tell us about Canadian political parties    Bratt doesn't expect lawn signs to wane in popularity, even as targeted ads on social media sites like Facebook become more common in political campaigns.  ""It's the personal touch,"" Bratt said. ""With lawn signs, you don't have to worry about fake ads.  ""A homeowner is willing to put this sign on their property and tell their neighbours who they're voting for and that's important. It's a show of support that is stronger than just voting.""

342,"The Bloc Québécois has been cruising to a comeback, but now faces big debate test","Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet surrounded himself on Monday with union leaders in Sept-Îles, Que., and appealed to the blue-collar workers of the northeastern iron town to help make his party kingmaker in the next Parliament.     ""Imagine the potential gains that would mean for the workers of Quebec,"" Blanchet said, outlining his hope of holding the balance of power should the election end with a minority government.  For most of the campaign, Blanchet has been closely following a path laid down by Quebec's centre-right provincial government, led by François Legault and the Coalition Avenir Québec (CAQ).   To Legault's desire for fewer immigrants, a values test for newcomers and restrictions on religious symbols, Blanchet has said yes, yes and yes.  ""The demands of the Quebec government are clear. They are legitimate and they are reasonable,"" Blanchet said. ""We will be its voice.""     Sure, it may lack originality, but there are signs the Bloc's platform is resonating with voters.  Whereas the Bloc's two main rivals in Quebec — the Liberals and Conservatives — have lost some support in the province since the election began, the Bloc's poll numbers have ticked upward.  CBC's poll tracker puts the party at around 21 per cent in the province, about the same as the Tories. And while that's still well behind the Liberals, who are polling around 35 per cent, this was a party that had been pronounced dead by many of its own members just a year ago.    Under the leadership of Martine Ouellet, seven of the party's 10 MPs quit the caucus; the end looked nigh for the sovereigntist party formed in 1991, following the failure of the Meech Lake Accord.   Taking over from Ouellet seemed like a fool's errand. Blanchet, a former Parti Québécois cabinet minister turned political pundit, was the only candidate in the race.  He quickly shepherded the erstwhile MPs back into the party and set about rebuilding its image. Gone now are the obituary-style headlines, replaced in recent days with more upbeat phrases: ""The Bloc gaining ground in Quebec,"" ""The Bloc unblocked,"" ""The stars align for the Bloc,"" and ""The Bloc's free ride.""  But on Wednesday, Blanchet will take part in his first debate as leader of a federal political party.  He's about to find out how far he can ride the coattails of a popular provincial government.  All eyes on the new kid  From the outset of the federal election campaign, Blanchet aligned himself with Legault's CAQ government, which is still polling well a year into its mandate.  ""We have a government that, for the first time in a longtime ... displays an unabashed nationalism,"" Blanchet said at his campaign kickoff speech. ""I have to say it: that feels good.""    The Bloc's long-standing partner at the provincial level is, of course, the Parti Québécois (PQ). So the Bloc's affection for this new party, the CAQ, which is not even sovereigntist, might appear, well, unfaithful.     But Legault's nationalism won him a majority, while the sovereigntist PQ is now the smallest party in the provincial legislature.  And it was Legault's conservative nationalism that delivered Quebecers sweeping legislation limiting religious symbols in the civil service, in the face of opposition from federalists.     Asked to explain his popularity, Legault told the Journal de Montréal he was giving power back to Quebec's ""historical majority."" It is nationalism, not sovereignty, that is the safer bet in Quebec politics these days.  But there's competition on this front. The Conservatives are vying for the same CAQ voters the Bloc is courting.  At a recent campaign event, the Conservatives' Quebec lieutenant, Alain Rayes, sketched his view of the battleground.    ""In some parts of the province, the Liberals are our adversaries,"" Rayes said. ""But we won't hide it, in the northern ring around Montreal, on the south shore [of Montreal] and in the centre of Quebec, it's the Bloc who is our adversary.""  Like the CAQ, Rayes and his fellow Conservative MPs from the province are pitching themselves as nationalists. And their angle is to remind voters of the Bloc's sovereigntist outlook.   ""When we speak with people who voted for the CAQ, more than a majority have the tendency to align with the Conservative Party,"" Rayes said.  ""These are people who decided to set aside the constitutional question, who are fed up with constitutional disputes.""  Is this when the gloves come off?  Up to this point in the campaign, Blanchet has largely been able to avoid discussing sovereignty, or how he will implement his promises.  As several observers have pointed out, there are few journalists travelling with Blanchet, and his policy proposals have endured far less scrutiny than those of the national parties.  That free ride will likely come to an end on Wednesday, when Blanchet takes part, along with Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer and NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, in a French-language debate hosted by TVA.    As Blanchet doesn't have a seat in Parliament, this will be the first time he will confront, and be confronted by, the other party leaders (he didn't take part in the Citytvu002FMaclean's debate).  TVA's unique debate format, which features one-on-one exchanges between the leaders, will only heighten the confrontational nature of the event.  Oh, and Blanchet's nickname while he was in provincial politics? Goon.  On the campaign trail, he's attracted the most attention when goading the other federal leaders into taking positions on Quebec's secularism law, Bill 21, which bans some civil servants, including teachers, from wearing religious symbols at work.  He even upped the ante last week by proposing that all federal services be delivered and received with an uncovered face, effectively an anti-niqab measure.  But Blanchet is on less sure footing when it comes to the other major theme of his campaign so far: the environment.  His policies closely mirror those of the CAQ government, itself no darling of the environmental movement. Blanchet's own history as Quebec environment minister — which included approving fracking and pipeline projects — is also starting to raise questions.  If his federalist rivals want to cut short the sweetheart story of the comeback kid, now is the time.  ",politics
343,Liberal promise to wipe out citizenship fees would cost $100M a year,"The Liberals are promising to eliminate the application fee for Canadian citizenship, removing what some immigrant advocates have called a key barrier for many newcomers.  Tucked in the party's platform released Sunday is a promise to make the path to citizenship ""more affordable."" The estimated cost is $400 million over four years.  ""Becoming a citizen allows new immigrants to fully participate in Canadian society and the process of granting citizenship is a government service, not something that should be paid for with a user fee,"" the platform reads. ""To make citizenship more affordable, we will make the application process free for those who have fulfilled the requirements needed to obtain it.""  The processing fee is now $530, which was hiked from $100 by the previous Conservative government. There is also a $100 ""right of citizenship"" fee.    Cost is considered a hurdle for many newcomers hoping to become Canadian citizens, especially low-income refugee families.  The Canadian Council for Refugees (CCR) has pressed the government to eliminate it.  Added costs for citizenship  ""The application fee is only one of the costs people have to assume — for example, many people have to pay for a test to prove they speak English or French well enough,"" said CCR executive director Janet Dench.  Andrew Griffith, a former senior immigration official and author on immigration issues, said while he has long railed against the ""steep"" increase brought in by the Conservatives, he doesn't see the need to eliminate fees entirely.  Becoming a citizen benefits Canada in terms of improved integration and participation and benefits the citizen with the right to a Canadian passport and voting rights, he said. Griffith said a fee of $300 would reflect that balance.  Shouldn't be free  ""Waiving the fees completely, at a cost of some $100 million a year, is excessive and will likely be perceived as political positioning to attract immigrant voters, rather than being evidence-based,"" he said.  ""To my knowledge, no Western country offers free citizenship.""  According to Elections Canada, there were 337,265 Canadian citizens added to the national register since the 2015 election.  In 2017, the Liberals loosened some rules around citizenship. They reduced the length of time that would-be citizens must be physically present in Canada. They lowered the age range for language and knowledge requirements. The fee remained the same.  In a statement to CBC, Ahmed Hussen, the immigration minister who is seeking re-election as an MP, said the promise stems from consultations on how to improve the system.  ""We heard from groups across the country who have said that the prohibitive fees were stopping families from finally becoming Canadian. Currently, the cost of applying for citizenship for an average family of four is almost $1,500,"" he said.",politics

Singh said that if elected next month, he would immediately declare a public health emergency and stop the criminalization of people dealing with addiction. But he stopped short of committing to regulating a safe supply of drugs.

""I'm exhausted. What are you going to do?""    Then there's Sierra Lawson-Bell, from Coquitlam, who works at a café where two people overdosed in the washroom in the past few years.   ""We noticed someone had been in the bathroom a long time,"" she said. ""Someone heard a thud. They called us. We found a young man on the floor and his lips had started to turn blue."" She performed CPR until paramedics arrived and resuscitated him.  But Lawson-Bell said that a year earlier, they weren't as lucky. A teenager she knew since middle school died from fentanyl.  ""It was quite emotional,"" said Lawson-Bell. ""It's hard ... I see addiction as a mental illness and it should be treated as such.""    Vancouver mayor calls for safe supply  These are just some of the personal stories Singh faced along the campaign trail in the Lower Mainland and Vancouver Island.

345,Justin Trudeau met 5 undecided Canadian voters. Here's what happened,"Access to Canada's supply-managed agriculture sectors is off limits in all future trade negotiations with other countries, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau said Monday.   ""As we negotiate any more trade deals, I can tell you access to supply-managed sectors is not on the table for any more deals,"" he said.   Trudeau said that goes for any post-Brexit trade negotiations with the United Kingdom.  ""If there is a deal with the U.K., there will be no more concessions than we already have given to [the Canada-EU trade deal] through that,"" he said.  Trudeau made the remarks during the first instalment of The National Presents: Face to Face with the Federal Party Leaders, where five undecided voters get five minutes to ask one of four federal party leaders about an issue close to their hearts as they go about making up their minds about whom to vote for.    Trudeau was questioned by Alain Philippot, a third-generation Manitoba dairy farmer, who expressed his concern over the foreign market access given to Canada's supply-managed dairy sector in recent international trade deals.   Between trade agreements already in effect — with the European Union and Pacific Rim trading partners — and the still-unratified rewrite of the North American Free Trade Agreement, dairy farmers have said they believe at least 10 per cent of Canada's dairy market has been given up to foreign suppliers.  Poultry and egg farmers will also see a significant share of their supply-managed market opened to American producers if the new NAFTA proceeds.  ""We need to have a strong agricultural sector in this country. We need strong family farms. We're going to make sure you are confident and your son is confident in his future,"" Trudeau said in response to Philippot's questions, assuring the farmer that his industry has given enough and would not be asked to give more.   Watch: Trudeau answers a question from dairy farmer Alain Philippot:    In August, Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau said no further dairy market-access would be granted in trade deals, but Trudeau's comments Monday indicate that access will also be barred for Canada's egg, chicken, turkey and hatching egg industries.

'Is that my prime minister?'  Inaara Hasmani, from Toronto, questioned Trudeau over photos that emerged two weeks ago showing that he had dressed up in blackface on at least three occasions, one of which occurred when he was 29 and working as a high school teacher at a private school in Vancouver.  ""I know you're an accepting person, but when pictures come out with brownface and stuff like that, it kind of creates a question like, 'Wow, is that my prime minister that's representing Canada out there?'"" Hasmani said to Trudeau.   Trudeau answered by saying he had made ""terrible choices"" when he was a younger man, but that he is an ally of people fighting against discrimination in Canada today.    Rosemary Barton, co-anchor of The National and moderator for the Face to Face events, pressed Trudeau on the issue, pointing out that she is roughly the same age as he is and she would have known better.   ""I genuinely thought that intent mattered,"" Trudeau replied. ""I thought that because I wasn't a racist, I could do this and it wouldn't be a bad thing and I didn't understand back then — and I'm fully up front about it — that it actually really hurt people.""  Watch: Trudeau answers a question from first-time voter Inaara Hasmani:    Coming up this week on The National Presents: Face to Face with the Federal Party Leaders:     Tuesday, Oct. 1: Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer.   Wednesday, Oct. 2: Green Leader Elizabeth May.   Thursday, Oct. 3: NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh.    Watch: What it was like talking to Trudeau    Methodology:  The undecided voters chosen to question the leaders have been carefully selected from across the country and represent the diversity of the electorate groups — regionally, racially and ethnically, socio-economic, different ages, different priorities. Each voter is undecided, but open to voting for the leader they are across from and looking for the answers they need for a question that relates to their lives.  We invited leaders who are running national campaigns. We provided a date range in order to have them all recorded and aired in the span of one week. Maxime Bernier and the PPC declined, citing scheduling issues. Yves-Francois Blanchet was not invited as the Bloc Quebecois is only running candidates in one province.",politics
346,Andrew Scheer's experience in the insurance industry: '6 or 7 months',"Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer has talked for years about his private sector experience as an insurance broker, but under questioning Monday, he admitted he only worked in the industry for ""six or seven months.""  CBC News asked him exactly how long he'd worked in a Regina insurance office.  ""I worked from approximately spring to some time in the fall,"" he said, saying he'd have to go back and check his personal records for the exact dates.  CBC News also asked Scheer to clarify exactly what his role was in this office.  He said his job was ""supporting the whole team … answering questions from customers and clients and doing preparatory work."" He added that he would also explain and pass on information to people coming into the office.     When CBC News suggested this meant he'd never actually worked as a broker, Scheer said that although he (eventually) received his accreditation under the Canadian Accredited Insurance Broker Program, ""at this particular office, the licensed brokers finalized all the transactions.""  Conrad Shenher, who owned the insurance firm where Scheer worked and is now retired, told CBC News in a phone call that he doesn't remember what Scheer's duties were because it was so long ago.    In response to an earlier question from The Canadian Press, Scheer had said ""I left before obtaining the full licence but I did receive that accreditation for general insurance.""  He also said he had many different jobs before being elected, including waiting tables.  Bio still says 'broker'  When Scheer ran for the leadership of the Conservative Party, the biographical information on his website said he ""passed the Canadian Accredited Insurance Broker program and began his working career in the insurance industry in Regina.""   That's the opposite order of events Scheer now describes.  Derek Lothian, chief executive officer of the Insurance Brokers Association of Saskatchewan, confirmed that Scheer completed a course with the association ""that would form part of the eligibility requirements for licensing.""  As of Monday afternoon, Scheer's biography on the Conservative Party's web page continued to say that ""before entering public life, Andrew worked in the private sector as an insurance broker.""    On Saturday, The Globe and Mail reported that despite Scheer's claim to have been a broker, the newspaper could find no evidence that he had received the accreditation needed to be a broker before he was elected to the House of Commons in 2004, when he was only 25.  Scheer worked as a political staffer before and after his brief stint in the insurance business in Regina.    Provincial legislation prohibits calling yourself a broker unless you hold a licence.  On Sunday, Liberal candidate Marco Mendicino suggested Scheer had been misrepresenting his qualifications and called for an investigation by the Financial and Consumer Affairs Authority of Saskatchewan and the Insurance Councils of Saskatchewan.  Ron Fullan, executive director of the insurance councils, confirmed receipt of Mendicino's letter.  ""We are currently reviewing it. At this point, we have no further comment on the issue.""

347,Forever 21 to close all 44 locations in Canada as retailer in bankruptcy proceedings,"Fashion retailer Forever 21 plans to close all 44 of its stores in Canada along with 168 of 534 stores in the U.S. as the chain undergoes bankruptcy proceedings.  The Los Angeles-based chain filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy code on Monday. A similar filing is underway under the Canadian equivalent, the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act.  The plan could see the chain maintain stores in the U.S., Mexico and Latin America, but an ""orderly wind-down"" of all Canadian locations is underway, the chain said in a release.  ""Forever 21 has made the difficult decision to discontinue further financial and operational support for Forever 21 Canada as we reposition the brand and global business to adapt to the current retail environment,"" the chain said.    ""All 44 Forever 21 Canada stores in Canada will close before the end of the year, and we have plans to liquidate our store inventory in the near term.""  16% of sales online not enough  The chain, founded in 1984, at one point booked $4.1 billion in annual sales and employed 43,000 people worldwide. But those numbers have fallen this year to $3.3 billion and 35,000 as the chain has become just the latest to tumble into the pitfalls that have brought down numerous retailers of late: dwindling sales and growing debt loads at a time when online shopping is on the rise.    Bankruptcy filings suggest about 16 per cent of the chain's sales came from its digital or online properties, but that wasn't enough to offset problems elsewhere.  Farla Efros, president of HRC Retail Advisory, said that's just not good enough to survive and thrive in retailing today.    ""Most retailers today are ... up to 25 to 30 per cent,"" Efros said. Typically every sale online cannibalizes one you may have made in store, which is why e-commerce sales have to be much higher than they are at the chain to be sustainable.  ""You really have to have that visibility, because every customer counts.""    The chain was a pioneer of the ""fast fashion"" trend, where retailers such as Forever 21, H&amp;M and others can quickly take runway looks and produce them affordably for the masses. That was a licence to print money for a while, Efros said, but the game has changed.  'Fast fashion' no longer en vogue  Retail consultant Bruce Winder said fashion is always tricky, because you are at the whim of fickle consumer tastes. If you guess poorly, you have a bunch of merchandise you can't sell, and that seems to have happened to the chain of late.  ""Once you lose some of that cachet with young people, it's very difficult to get that back,"" he said in an interview.  Another problem in the fast fashion world is that producing basically disposable clothing that lasts barely one year is becoming less fashionable with younger consumers.  ""The new sort of … millennial customer … and the people below them are incredibly environmentally conscious,"" he said.  ""If young people sort of start to feel that a certain brand is disposable, that they buy, they use it a few times, and then throw it out, that's not going to resonate well with them.""  While Efros says there's still money to be made in the fast fashion world, he said Forever 21 failed because their costs were too high.    That particular fate may have been sealed some time ago. The chain started expanding in a major way when U.S. department store chain Mervyn's liquidated more than a decade ago. Forever 21 moved into some of those prime locations — in the process committing to huge square footage more akin to a department store than a nimble clothing store that sells out of the latest fashions as quickly as it brings them in.  ""It shouldn't be a department store, it should be a one-floor store,"" Efros said. Those stores are ""super unproductive because you have to fill the space with clothing and people.  ""It's really a real estate issue... the fixed costs become so astronomical that you can't make a dime.""    Filings show the chain spends $450 million US a year to lease more than 12 million square feet of retail space around the world.  In its court filing, the chain admits its massive retail footprint is likely its biggest problem.  ""Many Forever 21 storefronts are located in malls,"" the chain said. ""As its neighbours have closed, the number of customers walking past Forever 21 has declined.""  While the chain said it is trying to boost its online presence to make up for it, it ""remains saddled with excessive floor space from leases entered almost a decade ago or more in unprofitable markets.""    It also admitted it expanded too quickly. Canada was the site of the chain's first non-U.S. in location, in 2001, but many more countries followed suit, and at its peak the chain had 251 locations in 39 countries outside the U.S.  While stores in the U.S. are still doing OK, locations in Canada, Europe and Asia are ""losing approximately $10 million per month on average over the past 12 months,"" the company says.  CCAA filings show the chain has assets worth $78.5 million in Canada, and liabilities of $107.6 million.  Forever 21 currently employs about 1,600 full-time and 350 part-time workers in Canada, more than half of which work in one of the chain's 22 stores in Ontario and the rest at another 22 stores scattered across Nova Scotia, Manitoba, B.C. and Alberta.  Almost all of them were given layoff notices on Monday, but the chain expects most of those jobs to remain through to the end of the year as the chain winds down operations.",business
348,Square Canada doesn't have a tech issue: it's a Cuban coffee issue,"The owners of a Toronto coffee stand say Square Canada has told them they can no longer use the popular payment technology because of concerns the coffee stand is selling beverages made from Cuban coffee beans.  Square Canada allows customers to tap or swipe their financial cards to pay for things — in this case coffee from Toronto's Little Havana coffee stand.  Little Havana's co owner, Monica Mustelier, said she'd been in contact with the technology company regularly since late August, after $14,000 in customer payments collected using Square never made it into her TD Canada Trust bank account.  In an earlier CBC News report, she said the company led her to believe the missing money was being held due to problems with an ""acquiring processor."" A Square Canada spokesperson had told CBC News, the situation wasn't ""one-off"" — but wasn't widespread, either.  It turns out, that's not the case, Mustelier says.  According to Mustelier, Square Canada told her the tech company uses the U.S. bank JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. to process payments, and the bank cannot or will not release the funds due to potential concerns over Little Havana's Cuban coffee beans.  ""I was kind of shocked and mad, because we're a Canadian company using Cuban goods bought and sold in Canada,"" Mustelier told CBC News Monday.  Mustelier legally imports the coffee beans through a Montreal distributor.    Today, Valerie Jackson, Square Canada's communications manager, confirmed to CBC News the issue isn't a tech problem after all.  ""I want to clarify that Square is not experiencing a technical glitch. While I cannot speak with you about Monica's individual case, I can tell you that Square's Customer Success team spoke with Monica yesterday, and she now knows the reason,"" she wrote in an email to CBC News.    The U.S. has a financial and commercial embargo against Cuba, severely limiting dealings with Cuban interests. Mustelier is Canadian and says she has no idea why a U.S. embargo is affecting her Canadian business.  ""For the U.S. sanctions against Cuba to affect us so directly is a shock, because I know Canada and Cuba have good relations,"" she says.  Money missing since August  Mustelier had been using Square technology for the past three years without incident.  Then, in late August, thousands of dollars Square Canada was supposed to transfer into her bank account never made it.  Ever since, Square Canada had been working with Mustelier to find out what went wrong.  ""I don't know why they would be using a third party in the States to process Canadian funds,"" Mustelier says about Square Canada's use of the U.S. bank.  ""If I knew Square's policy, I probably wouldn't have used them in the first place,"" she adds.  She says Square Canada has told her, the company is still working on refunding her the $14,000.  In the meantime, Mustelier is now looking for a payment system that uses Canadian banks only, to process transactions.  CBC News has contacted Square Canada for further comment on its plans.",business
349,Promising back-to-back deficits isn't political suicide in Canada anymore,"The church of the balanced budget — inaugurated by Saint Paul of Windsor in 1995 — has been losing power for some time now, even if it retains significant allure.  But with balance no longer universally accepted as the be-all and end-all, a more interesting choice has emerged for voters.  The first blow against balance came in January 2009 when Stephen Harper, who had once vowed never to spend into a deficit, was compelled to acknowledge that running a deficit wasn't necessarily a bad thing — that sometimes it's even the right thing to do.  In that case, it was the Great Recession that necessitated a quick influx of government spending. For the fiscal year of 2009-2010, the Harper government ran a deficit of $56.4 billion. Before they were done, the Conservatives ran six years of annual deficits, totalling $157.8 billion.    Still, it was considered heresy when Justin Trudeau announced in 2015 that a Liberal government would run three years of deficits to boost a sluggish economy. One newspaper described the plan as ""political suicide."" Shortly thereafter, Trudeau's Liberals won a majority.  Once in office, the Trudeau government pushed things further — first because of economic circumstances, then because of its own choices and priorities — resulting in deficits of $19 billion, $19 billion, $14 billion and $19.8 billion.  Tax cuts vs. spending hikes  Harper's deficits could be traced to his decisions to cut taxes — the GST in particular. Trudeau's deficits had more to do with new spending on federal programs.  While running for the leadership of the Conservative Party in 2017, Andrew Scheer vowed to balance the budget within two years of forming government. But as the 2019 general election neared — and with budget cuts by Doug Ford's provincial government angering voters in Ontario — Scheer lost some of his enthusiasm for swift deficit elimination. In May, he announced that a Conservative government would instead take five years to balance the budget.    The Liberal platform released on Sunday nudges the goalposts again. With promised new spending, a re-elected Liberal government would run larger deficits, starting at $27.4 billion in the first year and declining to $21 billion in the fourth.  The Conservative response was notable for what it lacked. Conservative finance critic Pierre Poilievre's primary argument was not that the deficits were themselves immoral or fundamentally unsound. Rather, he claimed the deficits inevitably would lead a Liberal government to increase taxes — tax hikes the Conservatives claim Trudeau is concealing now.  That attack might resonate more if the Harper government's deficits had triggered the same consequences.  The difference between 1995 and now  Economists like Kevin Milligan argue that the current deficit is not a matter for great concern — that government debt is not like household debt, borrowing rates are low, the situation in 2019 is not what it was in 1995 and recent deficits have been relatively modest.  The debt-to-GDP ratio — the debt as measured against the entirety of the national economy — was 31.5 per cent in 2014-2015. The Liberals now project that, even after eight years of deficits, it will be 30.2 per cent of GDP in 2023-2024. (For the sake of comparison, the debt-to-GDP ratio was 66.8 per cent in 1996, when Jean Chrétien and Paul Martin were compelled to cut spending.)    But the bottom line still resonates in political news coverage and partisan debate. It's an easy way to measure a budget or a platform, something that can be quickly understood — unlike the relative value of the actual spending and tax commitments that a government or party makes. ""Is the budget balanced?"" is a much easier question to answer than, say, ""How much should the government be spending to help families?""  Spending into a deficit can be easily described as reckless. But it's not clear the public is much more concerned than the average economist.  Other priorities  Just 13 per cent of respondents to an Ipsos Reid survey earlier this month said government debt was among their three most important election issues. An Angus Reid Institute poll found only three per cent of uncommitted voters considered it their top issue. In both polls, issues like climate change, the cost of living and health care rated much higher.  That combination of economic and public sentiment may have given Trudeau room to promise more. But it's also not clear how far the public's patience with red ink might last.  The most expensive item in the Liberal platform is the promise to raise the personal income tax deduction, but its new commitments also include a boost to the Canada Child Benefit for families with children under a year old, new breaks for post-secondary students, a boost to Old Age Security and new spending to mitigate climate change. In all, the Liberals are effectively offering to push slightly harder in the direction they've set out over the last four years.    Scheer's Conservatives are still committed to a greater degree of frugality. That, along with a series of promised tax cuts, should compel them to present a different picture of what a federal government would do when they table their complete platform — to present their own approach as a stark contrast with what the Liberals have planned.  In 2011, Harper's Conservatives promised $1.6 billion in new spending, while Michael Ignatieff's Liberals countered with a platform that included $5.5 billion in new initiatives, all of it covered by corresponding tax increases or spending cuts.  In 2019, instead of arguing within a box created by competing desires to both balance the budget and avoid broad-based tax increases, the platforms of the two main federal parties could be upwards of $20 billion apart.  That is not a small amount of money.  If the orthodoxy of the balanced budget has weakened, it has left room for a clearer choice.  ",business
350,China warns U.S. investment curbs would hurt global economy,"China warned the U.S. against trying to limit investment ties between the two countries, even as the Trump administration contradicted a report that Washington might be considering removing Chinese companies from American stock exchanges.  The foreign ministry appealed to Washington to ""meet us halfway"" and resolve disputes amid a tariff war that threatens to depress global economic growth.  China's warning comes two days after a U.S. official tweeted a Treasury Department statement saying the administration ""is not contemplating blocking Chinese companies from listing shares on the U.S. stock exchanges at this time.""  Stock markets slid after Bloomberg News reported last week that U.S. officials were considering restricting investment ties with China. It said other options including banning investments in Chinese companies by government pension funds.  ""To exert extreme pressure and even attempt to force the decoupling of China-U.S. relations will definitely damage the interests of U.S. and Chinese enterprises and people, cause financial market turmoil and endanger international trade and the world economic growth,"" said a foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang.  Negotiators are due to meet next week in Washington for a 13th round of talks aimed at resolving the tariff war over complaints about Beijing's trade surplus and technology ambitions.    The two sides have announced conciliatory measures including lifting or postponing punitive tariffs. But there has been no sign of progress toward settling their core disputes. Economists say a temporary agreement is possible but a permanent deal is unlikely this year.  ""We hope that the United States will work with China to deepen economic, trade and financial co-operation between the two countries,"" Geng said. ""We hope the United States will meet us halfway to work out a resolution in a constructive manner.""",business
351,Enbridge shares fall after regulator ruling on pipeline contracts,"Shares in Enbridge Inc. fell by about two per cent Monday morning after the Canada Energy Regulator ordered it to suspend an open season it was holding for service on its Canadian Mainline oil pipeline system.  Enbridge says the CER decision announced Friday after markets closed changes the timing but it still intends to proceed with signing firm contracts with shippers on the system that moves about 70 per cent of Canada's crude exports into the United States.  The pipeline system's current operating model, which makes space open to all bidders on a monthly basis, expires in June 2021.  The regulator says it shut down the open season after reviewing submissions from more than 30 parties, including complaints from producers Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., Suncor Energy Inc. and Shell Canada Ltd. that the process was unfair.  Analysts rate the CER decision as slightly negative for Enbridge because it means the Calgary-based company must now apply to the CER to approve the tolls, terms and conditions of the proposed service change before another open season can proceed.  In a report, analysts at Tudor Pickering Holt &amp; Co. say that could mean it will have to settle for lower tolls than it expected.",business
352,A week of tax promises that are more about politics than policy,"The week began well. Both the Liberals and the Conservatives unveiled broadly based tax cuts for the lowest tax bracket. Both plans were simple, fair and efficient — a welcome departure from years of boutique tax credits that narrowly targeted small groups of voters.  Then, much to the dismay of economists across the country, both parties rolled out a series of very specific, very targeted tax credits:      The Conservatives offered up tax cuts that would allow businesses with more than $1 million in assets to shelter money made through stock market investments.     The Liberals offered interest-free loans to those renovating their homes to make them more energy efficient.     The Conservatives unveiled a $20,000 tax credit for energy-efficient home renos.     The Liberals offered $2,000 bursaries to encourage low-income Canadians to visit national parks.     That sound you hear is economists across the country grinding their teeth.  To understand why these boutique tax proposals are so disappointing to policy experts, look first at why the broadly based approaches met with their approval.    Both the Liberal and Conservative broadly based tax proposals targeted the same group of Canadians. Two-thirds of Canadians make less than $46,000 a year; both the Liberal and Conservative plans would apply to that large cohort and reach a huge number of Canadians.  The duelling tax plans took different slightly approaches — the Conservative plan lowered the tax rate in that bracket, while the Liberal plan raised the amount of income that is exempt from taxation. But tax experts on either side of the aisle said they were a step in the right direction.  ""[It's] a fair approach,"" said Aaron Wudrick of the Canadian Taxpayer's Federation. ""A simpler approach is preferable to what we've seen, which is increasingly micro-targeted boutiques, which ... again, are designed for their political impact rather than their policy soundness.""  Broadly based tax policies reach large swaths of the population. Economists say they benefit the most people and let them decide what to do with the money.    Economist Trevor Tombe of the University of Calgary said he's a fan of such tax policy precisely because ""it doesn't care how you make your money, where you make it or what you choose to do with it.""  ""It leaves those decisions to you, your business and your family,"" he said.  Boutique tax gestures, like the ones the parties unveiled this week, ""distort decisions and add complexity to the tax code itself,"" he said.    Most economists say the best tax policies are simple and easy to understand. They're good for the bottom line and they make tax filing less of a hassle, renowned tax expert Allan Lanthier said.  Small, targeted tax cuts like the ones we saw this week ""significantly increase the compliance cost [for] taxpayers,"" Lanthier said. Filers have to find their old receipts for their kids' art programs or fitness classes, decide whether the new windows they installed meet the new requirements, and send everything off to an accountant in the hopes of getting some money back.  ""It adds complexity and costs,"" he said. ""And it adds a cost to the [Canada Revenue Agency] as well, because they have to process all these claims.""  And yet, such boutique tax cuts have dominated fiscal and tax policies for years.    ""Most boutique measures end up being more about their political saleability rather than their policy soundness,"" Wudrick said.  There's a reason parties like boutique tax cuts: they're easy to sell. People see themselves in those boutique credits and feel like the government is doing something for them. If you have kids in a sports or arts program, you'd welcome a tax credit. If you run a small business, you're probably cheering for the tax changes proposed by the Conservatives.  But Lanthier said their political utility doesn't make them good policy.  The return of passive income tax breaks  As an example, he points to the small business tax changes that were hotly debated last year. They were framed as a way of helping small businesses, the biggest source of jobs in the country. But a closer look at the fine print shows the changes would provide tax shelter to businesses with more than $1 million in so-called ""passive investments"".  That's not investment in new equipment or new mortgages. Passive investments tend to be in stocks or bonds. Less than three per cent of small businesses have more than $1 million in passive investments, meaning these changes would allow just a tiny fraction of Canadian businesses to lower the tax rate they pay on the earnings those investments bring in.    ""The stated objective [of the small business deduction], when it was introduced, is to assist small businesses in growing and to create more employment,"" said Lanthier. ""The legislative objective was not to provide for someone's retirement.""    ""Moving toward something that's broad-based and simple is better,"" said Tombe. ""It costs less to administer, it costs us less to comply with and it leaves us to make decisions based on their merits, rather than their provisions in the tax code.""  Tombe pointed out that there's still a lot of campaign left to go and the campaign to date has seen more actual policy talk than he expected. The parties saw how experts of all stripes applauded the broadly based tax policies while denouncing the boutique measures. So maybe future campaigns will see a shift toward an emphasis on tax policies that are more clear, more fair and more efficient — policies that make the tax code simpler.  Or maybe the 2019 campaign will end up proving that boutique tax measures are here to stay because they work — politically, at least.    ",business
353,WeWork shelves plans to go public,"WeWork's parent The We Company said on Monday it will file to withdraw its initial public offering, a week after the SoftBank-backed office-sharing startup ousted founder Adam Neumann as its chief executive officer.  The withdrawal of its IPO prospectus formalizes the end of the New York-based company's pursuit of a near-term listing and allows Neumann's successors to proceed with the company's financial turnaround without disclosing as much information publicly.  The decision to abandon the IPO marks the conclusion of a tumultuous few weeks for the office-sharing firm, which failed to excite investors who raised concerns about its burgeoning losses and a business model that involves taking long-term leases and renting out spaces for a short term.  Furthermore, experts pointed out that removing Neumann from the CEO role and addressing governance issues was not enough, and that such a business model was unlikely to thrive during an economic downturn.  According to the IPO prospectus it filed earlier in September, We Company had cash and cash equivalents of roughly $2.5 billion as of June 30. However, while revenue doubled to nearly $1.8 billion US in 2018, its losses also more than doubled to $1.9 billion.  Pressure to find new funding  The decision to scrap the public share sale will also put pressure on WeWork to secure alternative funding, given that a $6 billion loan deal with banks, agreed last month, hinged on a successful share sale of at least $3 billion. Analysts have projected that WeWork will burn through several billion dollars over the next few years and thus needs to keep on raising fresh funds at favorable valuations.  According to two sources familiar with the matter, the company is currently looking to trim its workforce and slow down its expansion in order to burn through less cash and be less dependent on fresh funding.  The company is in talks to raise fresh funding from investors, including SoftBank Corp., the sources added.    SoftBank, which had been pushing WeWork to postpone its IPO and is currently attempting to raise its second $100 billion-plus Vision Fund, is under pressure to assuage key backers of the fund who have raised concerns over the long-term viability of the investment fund.  The decision to withdraw the IPO was no surprise, though. It was widely expected after the company postponed the share sale earlier in September, following push-back from prospective stock market investors over its widening losses and Neumann's unusually firm grip on the company.  ""We have decided to postpone our IPO to focus on our core business, the fundamentals of which remain strong,"" WeWork's newly appointed co-CEOs Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham said on Monday.      We have every intention to operate WeWork as a public company and look forward to revisiting the public equity markets in the future.  - Artie Minson, co-CEO, WeWork     ""We have every intention to operate WeWork as a public company and look forward to revisiting the public equity markets in the future,"" Minson and Gunningham added.  SoftBank, which owns nearly a third of We Company, invested in the startup at a $47 billion valuation in January. But investor skepticism led to it earlier this month considering a potential IPO valuation of as low as $10 billion, Reuters reported.    We Company had vowed to pursue the IPO and complete the share sale by the end of the year after Neumann stepped down as CEO. However, sources had told Reuters last week that the IPO was unlikely to be completed this year.  Rough ride for startup IPOs  WeWork's doomed IPO marks a rough period for startups that have been going public in recent weeks. Last week, U.S. entertainment and talent agency company Endeavor Group Holdings pulled its IPO, while shares of Peloton Interactive Inc., the fitness startup known for on-demand workout programs on its exercise bikes, slid as much as seven per cent in their market debut.  Earlier in September, teeth alignment firm SmileDirectClub Inc. opened to an underwhelming debut.  Ride-hailing companies Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc. also went public earlier this year with high expectations, but their shares have tumbled since then after investor concerns over their steep losses.

In the U.S., a tentative $3-billion agreement has been reached that would propose to resolve court claims against Purdue entities and Sackler family members, ""part of the global resolution,"" according to a statement by Purdue Pharma's head of corporate affairs and communications.  But any settlement needs to include Canada, notes the department's statement.  ""To the extent that there is a real desire on the part of Purdue entities and members of the Sackler families to achieve 'global resolution,' then any proposed agreement ought to account for and include payment for the Canadian claims.""  The province says if it isn't included in this settlement, it is ""determined to continue to pursue our claims against the Purdue entities and also against the members of the Sackler family to the fullest extent permitted by law.""  ""While the province is encouraged by a stated desire to resolve global claims, the opioid crisis is unfortunately not limited to the U.S., and continues to have a devastating impact in Canada, with a correspondingly extraordinary toll on our health care system to the ultimate detriment of Canadian taxpayers.""   Class action alleges false marketing of opioids  Newfoundland and Labrador is part of a national class action launched by British Columbia last year seeking compensation from Purdue Pharma, the drug company that began selling the powerfully addictive painkiller, OxyContin in Canada in 1996. Members of the Sackler family founded and own the company.  The Canadian class-action lawsuit alleges opioids were marketed as less addictive than other pain drugs. It seeks to recover government health-care and other direct costs incurred due to opioid-related disease, injury or illness.  Newfoundland and Labrador is also part of a working group that is sharing information on opioids with other provinces, including Ontario and New Brunswick, that are also part of the lawsuit.  The Newfoundland and Labrador government struck a task force in December 2003 to study OxyContin, which at the time had been linked to at least seven deaths in the province.  The task's force final report contains 50 recommendations including tamper-proof prescription pads, educational programs, and  a methadone program.

355,How urban design can help people with dementia navigate neighbourhoods and public spaces,"Roger Marple stood in front of the door to his condo unit, yet he didn't even know it.  ""I'm walking up and down the hallway, I don't even know where the hell I am,"" said the 61-year-old, who was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease a few years ago.  ""It took me a while to figure out I was at home.""  Marple says such disorientation is ""something that a lot of people with dementia face"" and argues that better urban design — such as signage, landmarks and clear-cut paths — can allow people to be ""safely open and out and about in the community.""    Marple, who lives alone with his cat Bernie in Medicine Hat, Alta., is one of over half a million Canadians living with dementia. According to the Alzheimer Society of Canada, that number is expected to reach nearly a million by 2031.    As waitlists for care facilities grow longer and more people with dementia are choosing to live within their own communities, urban planning and design will play an increasingly important role in helping them live safe, comfortable and independent lives.  Exercise and social interaction are ""incredibly important"" for people living with dementia, says Samantha Biglieri, an urban planner working towards her PhD at the University of Waterloo.    Shops, landmarks and pedestrian medians  Inspired by similar research in European cities, Biglieri wanted to figure out how to create dementia-inclusive public spaces in a Canadian suburban context.  Between April 2018 and February 2019, she worked with 15 people living with early-onset dementia in Ontario's Waterloo Region, walking with them in their neighbourhoods, tracking them on GPS devices and having them fill out travel diaries. All of the participants self-identified as living with milder stages of dementia, which allowed them to go out for walks on their own.    During their walkabouts, Biglieri says she realized the importance of shops, parks and community centres within residential neighbourhoods for people living with dementia.    ""For participants who could walk to a store — that made all the difference in their life…. Otherwise, you end up just walking around the block, which is what some of my participants ended up doing.""  She recommends creating more commercial nodes within residential neighbourhoods. For example, building corner stores and ensuring there is a grocery store within walking distance.  ""The default still in new communities and areas around the [Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area] is still this single-detached homes with commercial on the edges,"" she said.  Biglieri also noted the importance of landmarks — not just large structures, like statues or monuments, but smaller, unique features, like a stone garden in front of a house. Participants relied on these markers to help them with wayfinding, she explained.  ""They also would say things like, 'I can see the Wal-Mart or the McDonald's sign from far away, and I know I'm going in the right direction.'""    Biglieri offered other design decisions that could make all the difference, such as lining more streets with trees so that people are shaded from the sun, and building pedestrian islands in the middle of roads so people can cross safely.  ""One of the symptoms of dementia can be impaired depth perception, and so not being able to judge how far away a car is can be a real issue.""  Canada's first 'dementia village'  This past summer, a senior care facility that uses similar design principles to create a dementia-inclusive community opened in Langley, B.C.  Called The Village, it's billed as ""the first memory care community of its kind in Canada,"" modelled after communities in Holland and the U.S.    The facility consists of six cottages, each with 12 or 13 private bedrooms tailored to those living with dementia.   Karen Tyrell, a dementia specialist who helped design some of the wayfinding cues at the facility, says the team behind the project wanted to ""make it look like a home, not like a hospital.""    Some of the cottages have porches and white picket fences, so that they look as familiar as possible to houses in the communities the residents are used to. Noise and visual clutter are kept to a minimum, since they can sometimes be overwhelming for people with dementia. There are also distinctive paths, lots of signage and landmarks in order to aid with wayfinding.    ""Evidence has shown that well-planned, enabling environments can have a substantial positive impact on the quality of life of someone living with dementia,"" Tyrell said.  Biglieri says that while models like The Village may work for some, she would also like to see solutions where people with dementia are a part of the larger community.  ""We have to bring people into the community, we can't just always rely on segregation,"" she said.      We need to see dementia from all the faces, not just end of days.  - Roger Marple, advocate and person living with dementia     Biglieri, who will be defending her dissertation in December, says it was important for her to consult people with dementia directly. ""We have to ask groups that have historically been marginalized: how did they experience the city?"" she said.   Marple, who is now an advocate and public speaker, says that in addition to design, the key to making communities more dementia-friendly is to reduce stigma of the condition through education.  He wants Canadians to know that people with dementia are out in the world living full and productive lives — not just sitting in care facilities, unable to communicate and staring out of windows.  ""There are a thousand faces to dementia … We need to see dementia from all the faces, not just end of days.""",health
356,"Outdoor play essential for kids, so get them out there","For Mark Tremblay,  the worst punishment he ever got as a kid was a good grounding.  ""[It] meant you had to stay indoors. And isn't that very telling?"" says Tremblay, a father of four and the director of healthy active living and obesity research at CHEO.  ""Today, if you told your kids they had to stay indoors they'd shrug their shoulders,"" said Tremblay, who's also the chair of the new group, Outdoor Play Canada.  The group will advocate for active lifestyles for young people and was launched at Breath of Fresh Air Outdoor Play Summit, which got underway Friday in Ottawa.  The two-day ""national forum on outdoor play"" will feature workshops, lectures and panel discussions involving experts in the field, according to the summit's website.  It takes place at the Ottawa Forest and Nature School and at Wesley Clover Parks Campground.    Physical, social, emotional benefits  Tremblay said parents — often with the best intentions — tend to keep their children inside with music lessons and unlimited digital media use.  Even active families rarely allow for unstructured outdoor time, he said. And when you add in fears around kids being outdoors after dark, there's little time for them to just be kids.  ""Lack of calibration with natural instincts and natural play desires is seriously affecting the health of our children — socially, emotionally, mentally, physically,"" said Tremblay.  Fortunately, the remedy is easy and inexpensive, Tremblay said — and the benefits are immediate.  ""If you put children, or youth, or you or me outside, we will be more active than if we're inside. Even if there was no intent to be active, it will happen. Every research study that's ever been published shows that. Lots of Canadian data shows that,"" he said.  ""We're breathing fresh air instead of the stale, contaminated air indoors. We're not as exposed to infectious diseases which contain themselves indoors ... all of this good stuff just happens. It doesn't cost anything. You just need to go out.""    'Green agenda'  Ottawa-based Children and Nature Alliance of Canada is also helping to organize this weekend's summit.   Operations director Heather Wilson thinks it's also important to tie a renewed interest in outdoor play to the ""green agenda.""  ""We're really happy this summit is happening this weekend because we see a direct connection with the youth-led movement, with the current climate change crisis, and the activities this weekend around that,"" Wilson said.    ""And it's really helping to connect youth and children and families with the natural world.""  Wilson thinks schools also have a role to play, pointing to a project called ""Nearby Nature"" they run in conjunction with the Ottawa Carleton District School Board.  ""That's to encourage educators in the schools to look at ways they can engage their students outside,"" said Wilson.     ",health
357,"U.S. vaping-related death toll is 13, with 805 illnesses reported","Hundreds more Americans have been reported to have a vaping-related breathing illness, and the death toll has risen to 13, health officials said Thursday.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control said 805 confirmed and probable cases have been reported, up 52 per cent from the 530 reported a week ago. At this point, illnesses have occurred in almost every state.  The confirmed deaths include two in California, two in Kansas, two in Oregon and one each in Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Mississippi and Missouri. The deaths in Oregon and Mississippi was announced by officials in those states Thursday.  An Oregon state official urged people to immediately stop using all vaping products.  ""People should stop vaping immediately,"" said Dean Sidelinger, Oregon's state health officer. ""If you vape, whether it's cannabis, nicotine or other products, please quit.""  Canada has no confirmed cases related to vaping or e-cigarettes.  There are three incident reports from two provinces under investigation, with at least one dating back to 2018, Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam said on Monday. London-Middlesex's is among the three reports on which provinces need to gather more information to determine if they're cases.  In the U.S. over the summer, health officials in a few states began noticing reports of people developing severe breathing illnesses, with the lungs apparently reacting to a caustic substance. The only common factor in the illnesses was that the patients had all recently vaped.  As a national investigation started and broadened, reports have increased dramatically.  It's not clear how many of the 275 added cases occurred in the last week, and how many are being logged long after they happened. The CDC has not released details on when symptoms began in each case.  The agency's count includes only illnesses that have met certain criteria. Other illnesses are also being investigated.  Most patients have said they vaped products containing THC, the ingredient that produces a high in marijuana. The investigation has been increasingly focused on products containing THC, with some attention on ingredients added to marijuana oil.    But some patients have said they vaped only nicotine. Currently, health officials are advising people not to use any vaping product until the cause is better understood.  ""Vaping is not without risk, and the potential long-term effects of vaping remain unknown. Non-smokers, people who are pregnant and young people should not vape,"" Health Canada advised.  Health-care professionals are asked to report severe adverse reactions or incidents related to vaping products, including nicotine or cannabis, to Health Canada.",health
358,"Toronto-area man out $2,775 after e-transfer fraudsters impersonate him on email","A Toronto-area contractor says it was ""pretty creepy"" to discover someone had hacked into his email and impersonated him — convincing customers of his family-owned granite countertop business to send thousands of dollars via e-transfer.   The fraudsters then stole the payments.  ""You can't think of something like this happening,"" said Sarmen Sinani, of Markham, Ont.  ""They [fraudsters] were saying, 'Send me the money. And don't send a cheque. Just e-transfer it.'""  Sinani is one of more than 200 people Go Public has learned were recently targeted by fraudsters who stole tens of thousands of dollars, sent via Interac e-transfers, by breaking into email accounts and redirecting the money.       Been wronged and you're not the only one affected? Contact our Go Public team     It has some experts questioning why the popular electronic money transfer system involves email at all, when other jurisdictions have stronger security.   ""Canadian customers deserve the best safety and security for their banking and e-transactions,"" said cybersecurity expert Claudiu Popa, who advises governments and companies. ""Unfortunately, we are far from getting there.""  Sinani was working on a customer's order when he emailed her in March, asking for a 50 per cent deposit. By May, he still hadn't received it, so he asked again.   To his surprise, his client said she had e-transferred it on March 15. Sinani searched through deleted emails and discovered a fraudster had impersonated him and told his client to e-transfer $2,775.  ""The hacker would alter my conversation to them [his customer] and alter their conversation to me,"" said Sinani. ""Basically they were taking full control of two people, just going back and forth. It's unbelievable.""  Posing as Sinani, the fraudster told his client he had an out-of-town family emergency and instructed her not to stop by the store to drop off a cheque.   Instead, the fraudster told her to send an e-transfer to a new email that appeared similar to the actual email for Sinani's family business, Sinco Marble and Granite.  Then, the fraudster posed as Sinani's client and altered her emails, telling Sinani that she was dealing with a family emergency and couldn't come to the shop to pay the deposit.  ""It was insane,"" said Sinani. ""They played us good.""    No help from Interac, CIBC  Sinani says when his customer contacted Interac, the company said its e-transfer system had worked — moving money from point A to point B — and that it was not going to investigate.  ""They're just not being co-operative,"" he said. ""I'm sure there's an easy way to see where the money went. But no one wants to work on it, I guess.""  Interac declined an interview request with Go Public, but in a statement said each fraud case is ""unique and customers should speak to their bank directly.""  Interac would not address Sinani's — or other customers' — concerns. Interac is a private company and Canada's big banks and credit unions are among its shareholders.  Sinani's customer lost the money through her account at CIBC. The bank would not tell Go Public what — if anything — it was doing to help trace the money, but in a statement said funds sent ""to an email impersonator are very difficult to recover.""  York Regional Police are investigating.   'Turning into an arms race'  A cybercrime expert who specializes in password cracking says many people aren't aware of the underground community of fraudsters who buy and share email and password information, aimed at draining bank accounts.  ""There's people doing offensive research to determine new ways of attacking,"" security systems, said Dustin Heywood, with IBM's X-Force Red.   ""It's turning into an arms race.""  Heywood estimates that the average person uses their email and password on about 300 sites — from the local library to pizza delivery — and any one of those databases can get hacked.    ""The problem is, not every site has the same level of security around their passwords,"" he said. ""So if a weaker site gets hacked, then all of a sudden your password is being leaked out.""  Heywood says hackers then use bots — custom software — that can lurk undetected on hundreds of thousands of computers.  ""They could have something sitting there for months and when the right keywords come through"" — such as ""payment"" or ""deposit"" and — ""Bang! We've got ourselves a transfer.""  So Interac's e-transfer system, he says, is only as secure as users' email and passwords.  Interac system 'unique'   On the heels of a Go Public story published last week about e-transfers, we heard from a number of people who have lived in other countries that use systems that allow people to electronically transfer funds directly from bank to bank.  ""One does not have to worry about payments being intercepted,"" Andrew Dunning wrote, about e-transfers in the U.K.   ""Everything is practically instantaneous, and it's all traced between the banks. It's shocking to me that the [Canadian] government has not mandated the implementation of this system.""    Rajesh Vijayaraghavan, who studies risk management in financial institutions, says Interac's system is ""unique"" because it relies on email, unlike most in other developed countries.  Vijayaraghavan, an assistant professor at the University of British Columbia's Sauder School of Business, says the U.S., Australia, New Zealand, India and other countries have had systems in place for years that allow e-transfers directly from bank to bank — using only a bank code and a person's account number.   ""The rest of the world can't be wrong,"" he said. ""It's the better system.""  Two weeks ago, the European Union went a step further, requiring all financial institutions to offer two-factor authentication — a system which only allows a user to log on to an account once they've received a code on a separate device or an email at a different email address.  Vijayaraghavan says shifting away from an email-reliant system would require work.  ""It's a legacy system,"" he said. ""So this has to be a co-ordinated effort from all banks.""    Popa, the cybersecurity expert, says the only way banks will improve security for e-transfers — and the auto-deposit option — is if the government forces them.   He says requirements for strong authentication are needed immediately, instead of the convenient, but less secure, system currently in place.  ""No more secrecy and downplaying these issues,"" Popa said. ""Canadians need to demand reform from their politicians.""    Sinani the contractor, says he's no longer a fan of e-transfers, since he and his customer are now in a ""stressful"" dispute over who should cover the stolen $2,775.   But he says about 80 per cent of his customers want to pay using e-transfer because it's so convenient.  ""Convenient is great, until something like this happens to you,"" he said. ""Improving the system would be better.""         Submit your story ideas   Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

359,'How dare you!': Young activists are harnessing the power of social media to capture the world's attention,"  In just one year, Greta Thunberg went from being one lonely demonstrator stationed outside the Swedish parliament to a climate star joined by hundreds of thousands of people in cities worldwide.   Seattle youth activist Jamie Margolin, 17, testified before United States' lawmakers alongside Thunberg this week. Like Thunberg, she too started small. Margolin started organizing climate rallies about a year ago with other young activists under the hashtag #ThisIsZeroHour.   In her senior high school year, Parkland shooting survivor Leonor Muñoz and her classmates spearheaded numerous demonstrations after their hashtag #MarchForOurLives went viral. Since then, a number of gun control laws have been passed across U.S., but mostly at the state level.   During the 1960s, flower power was used by anti-war demonstrators to get their message across, but the current young generation has more than just an image and a message — they've got social media, and they are masters at putting it to work.   The platform has existed for about half of this generation's lifetime, allowing them to have a unique fluency older people lack, explained Buzzfeed News curation editor and Party Lines podcast host Elamin Abdelmahmoud.  ""You have to imagine that social media is shaping their lives in a different way than it is shaping ours,"" he said.  Here are two moments of youth activism going viral:    They're grabbing the agenda and forcing politicians, the mainstream media, and adults in general to pay attention.  ""We know how to post at the right times, get hashtags trending, get people involved,"" said Muñoz. ""We know social media and we know its limits.""  'Emperor has no clothes'  Social media's power to connect high volumes of people comes from its accessibility. Posts are able to be made and viewed in real-time, reactions can be publicly seen.  ""Everyone else could see that so much easier than they could ages before,"" Abdelmahmoud said. ""I think that kind of changes the quality of the message.""    But he said while the quality of the conversation has shifted, the protests have yet to make the political impact they want.  Watch: Wendy Mesley speaks with Parkland shooting survivor Leonor Muñoz and youth climate activist Jamie Margolin    ""For now, politically, no, they're not having results because it's still mostly older white men who are in control of most of the policies that they want to change.""  But as Muñoz sees it, politicians are feeling the pressure and that message is spreading.   ""We've realized the emperor has no clothes and more important than that, we realize that for us, our silence will not protect us.""   And they're not about to stop now.   ""We're really making momentum and politicians are now really feeling the pressure that they have really two options. Either be a climate champion or get out,"" said Margolin.  ",technology
360,"Big Manitoba fish make a run for the border, biologists find","For decades, Winnipeggers have headed south to Grand Forks or Fargo, N.D., in search of a deal.  Turns out, some of our biggest fish have been doing the same thing.  Biologists working on both sides of the Canada-U.S. border have found two species of fish found in the Red River — channel catfish and the carp-like bigmouth buffalo — can travel hundreds of kilometres, sometimes swimming all the way from Winnipeg to Fargo and back, possibly in pursuit of food or the perfect place to spawn.  The long-distance travels of channel cats and bigmouth buffalo are among the findings of research aimed at illuminating what happens beneath the surface of the famously muddy water in the Red River drainage basin.  Since 2010, University of Nebraska-Lincoln biologist Mark Pegg and other U.S. researchers have been implanting T-shaped tags in Red River drainage-basin catfish in the hopes anglers and commercial fishers will call a 1-800 number when they discover one of the identification markers. So far, they've tagged 15,849 fish and received about 1,100 reports about their movements.  Then in 2016, Winnipeg research biologist Douglas Watkinson and his colleagues and Fisheries and Oceans Canada started implanting transmitters in seven species of fish and installed a grid of 205 receivers on the bottom of Lake Winnipeg, the Red River and some of its tributaries.    To date, Watkinson's team has tagged 786 walleye, freshwater drum, common carp, burbot, lake sturgeon, channel cats and bigmouth buffalo — and has detected their movements about 12 million times.  The scientists, who plan to present their findings Monday evening at a seminar in Winnipeg (Victoria Inn, 6:30 p.m., free admission), say they were surprised how far channel catfish and bigmouth buffalo travel along the Red River, especially considering the obstacles the fish face at the St. Andrews Lock and Dam in Lockport, Man., and a weir at Drayton, N.D.  ""Buffalo are ripping back and forth all the way to Fargo,"" said Watkinson, co-author of the seminal Freshwater Fishes of Manitoba.  ""We're not sure why, right — if it's related to feeding, maybe some exploring and just looking for potential spawning in the future? We're not even sure if they spawn every year, at this point.""    Despite their status as one of the largest fish in Manitoba — and the longest-lived freshwater fish on the planet — bigmouth buffalo are little-known in this province because they're rarely caught by anglers or commercial fishers. They can live to be 112, recently published North Dakota research says, and prefer swimming in rivers rather than lakes, Watkinson said.  Unlike carp, bigmouth buffalo are native to North America. They feed on zooplankton — tiny animals that float in the water column — rather than vegetation or fish.  Bigmouth buffalo are, however, similar to carp in that they spawn in flooded vegetation. The species could be sensitive to the loss of wetlands, Watkinson said.    His team found lake sturgeon prefer swimming around river mouths rather than open water in Lake Winnipeg, despite the species' common name, and invasive carp that spawn in Netley-Libau Marsh, at the bottom of lake, tend to spend most of the summer near the mouth of the Winnipeg River.  Watkinson's team also found that most Lake Winnipeg's walleye, the most commercially valuable fish in the world's 11th-largest lake, move from the southern basin to the northern basin rather than remain in place.     Manitoba aims to restore fish supply in Lake Winnipeg by buying back quotas, changing net sizes   Fewer fish or fishy science? Industry, biologists differ over Lake Winnipeg walleye    This has big implications for the commercial walleye fishery, as some scientists had surmised there were two separate populations of walleye in the lake.  Using transmitters and receivers, the Canadian researchers also found what Pegg's team in the U.S. found by implanting identification tags: channel catfish move great distances, as well.  ""My suspicion is that they're following food,"" Pegg said.  Catfish feed on smaller fish such as cisco and goldeye and may chase them all the way up into Lake Winnipeg's northern basin, he said.  ""The extent of the movement is a bit surprising,"" he said. He did not expect catfish to swim 1,200 kilometres.  His said his research also helps settle the question of whether sport fishers are catching the same catfish over and over or different fish most of the time.  The data suggests there are about 1.5 million channel cats in the Red River downstream from Lockport, he said.  This too has big implications for commercial fishers, who want to harvest catfish that wind up in their nets as bycatch.     Commercial fishers want province to claw back ban on channel catfish catch    Pegg said it's unclear what impact a commercial harvest would have on channel cats, other than it's likely Red River catfish would become smaller.

361,Climate lessons from the classroom spill into the streets,"Thirteen year-old Adlyn Gilbert has pushed her way the front of the stage at Queen's Park. She's got her backpack slung over both shoulders and she keeps checking her phone as the global climate strike gets underway in Toronto.  Before long, she is listening intently to the speakers. This is her twelfth climate rally. She says it won't be her last.   At first, Gilbert seems quiet. Unassuming. That is, until she starts belting out her chant as the climate strike march begins in the streets.  The contrast in her demeanour is startling.  ""Hey, hey! Ho, ho! Fossil fuels have got to go!""    She's joined by her two friends, Tenzin Tethong and Lauren Robinson. And they're all concerned about their future.  ""I'm here to fight for my future, for the future my grandchildren for my great-grandchildren, and anyone who is on this planet, all living beings,"" says Gilbert.  ""It's just terrifying how bad in such a deep hole we've dug ourselves into.""  Gilbert says her knowledge about climate change comes from school and her many teachers. What she's learning in the classroom frightens her. In particular, she's concerned about floods — not just in cities, but around the world.  ""There are a lot of places in the world that will definitely be gone if we stay at this rate,"" she says. ""There are so many places that will be off the map soon. That's really scary.""    Many of the children in the streets do not know the details of the science, but they are convinced that they're heading into a different world than the one that exists today.  Zoe Keary-Matzner was one of the speakers at the rally ahead of the march. After a fiery speech, she, like Gilbert, seems quiet and reserved.  ""I'm scared about my future,"" she says. ""But I'm mainly scared about ecosystem destruction and the destruction of the environment.""    She's been to many rallies, and she's happy to have seen them grow in size from just a few dozen youth to the thousands gathered in Toronto, and the millions around the world.  Does she think the policymakers are hearing her and her generation?  She's hopeful.  ""Some people are taking us seriously,"" she says. ""Some people aren't, but mainly people are taking us seriously.""  'It's still helpful'  Along the march route, not far from Gilbert, 9-year-old Ella Tomczak grasps a handmade sign reading ""How dare you?"" It's a nod to global climate activist Greta Thunberg's recent speech at the United Nations.  Tomczak and her classmates, Noa Nicholishen and Lucas Garson, are marching because they want to ""save the planet."" They say they get most of their information from their parents.  ""If you don't do something about the climate, everyone would die, and there would be nothing left,"" she says.    But Tomczak is keenly aware that the protest isn't going to save the planet in and of itself.   ""Even though it's a protest — it's not stopping polluting cars — it's still helpful.""  And that helpfulness, she hopes, will incite governments to make effective change.    Gilbert, now ahead of Tomczak, weaves from side to side in the horde of people. She's taking in the crowd, people-watching. Whenever the crowd stops chanting, Gilbert confers with her friends Tethong and Robinson about what might be another good chant. (""Who let the carbon out? You! You! You!"")  She says this won't be the last protest she attends. She wants change. She may not be able to vote yet, but she's doing what she can to ensure her voice — and that of a generation that potentially faces a dangerously changing world — is heard.    And she has words for those who criticize this generation's call to action.  ""They're underestimating children,"" Gilbert says. ""As far as our opinions and how much we might know and understand.""

362,J. Lo and Shakira to team up for Super Bowl halftime show,"Jennifer Lopez and Shakira are going to bring the heat to the 2020 Pepsi Super Bowl Halftime Show.  NFL, Pepsi and Roc Nation announced Thursday that the superstar performers, who have each released music in Spanish and English, will perform on Feb. 2 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Fla.  Lopez and Shakira both posted a photo of them standing side by side on social media to announce the news.  ""Going to set the world on fire,"" Lopez wrote.  ""It doesn't get any bigger than this! So excited about getting on that #SuperBowlLIV #PepsiHalftime stage!"" Shakira wrote.  The choice marks the first time two Latino artists will headline the show. Gloria Estefan was the Super Bowl's first Latino headliner ever when she performed in 1992. She also served as headliner in 1999.    Lopez and Shakira have had major success on the pop and Latin charts over the years, with multiple hit songs and albums.

365,Canadians will soon have even more options in streaming — but can they afford them all?,"Jessica Gallos-Pronyk already has Netflix, but she wants to be among the first Canadians to sign up for Disney Plus, the new streaming service that will launch here mid-November.   ""We're a Disney family,"" said the Winnipeg mother of four — two boys aged 11 and 10 and twin girls, aged 8. ""We watch all the Star Wars movies, we watch Marvel movies. And they've pre-advertising some original content.""  The family watches shows on Netflix almost every day, and they pay for a cable package that includes Crave, HBO and various sports channels. Even so, Gallos-Pronyk isn't concerned about paying an additional $89.99, the annual fee for Disney. She points out it costs almost that much to take the family to a movie at a local theatre.   ""I mean heck, it's Winnipeg,"" says Gallos-Pronyk with a smile. ""We have long, cold winters.""      Couch potatoes everywhere in Canada can rejoice: there will soon be more TV-viewing options than ever before. The list of new services entering the market just keeps growing:     Disney Plus will offer its service for $8.99 a month, or a year long subscription for $89.99.   Apple TV Plus will launch Nov. 1 for $5.99 a month — with a limited selection.   Roku — maker of a $49.99 set-top streaming device — will add 14 free channels in Canada by the end of September.      Some consumers intend to experiment with a combination of services.  ""I may keep the cable and Netflix,"" says Raymond Adams-Rajinderdeepkumar, of Scarborough, Ont. ""I may just keep the Disney and Netflix. I may keep them all. I'll see.""     WATCH: The National's story about how the Disney+ and Apple TV+ launches could affect Netflix and consumers    Expensive business  The new selections may be a delight for customers, but they're creating a brutal battle for the companies behind the services who have to scramble — and pay a fortune — to line up the type of content that will lure subscribers.   Netflix just reportedly paid more than $500 million US for the rights to stream Seinfeld reruns, while HBO Max paid a billion for the rights to The Big Bang Theory. And there are skirmishes over exclusivity: Warner pulled Friends from Netflix in the U.S. in order to stream it on its HBO Max service. Netflix also lost The Office to NBCUniversal's new streaming service called Peacock.     All the services are pouring huge amounts of money into original programming as well. Apple TV Plus paid big bucks to Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon for its showcase drama, The Morning Show. Netflix is spending a reported $14 billion on its own programming this year.   ""They've got to invest in content, because content is, in a sense, their best marketing tool,"" says Ramona Pringle, who runs Ryerson University's TransMedia Zone and writes a technology column for the CBC.  ""If there's nothing to watch, people aren't going to stay.""  Pringle points out that ""buzz"" plays a big role in helping people discover new services and shows.   ""We've all had that moment of 'OK, well there's nothing on Netflix,' and the next question is 'well, everyone's talking about this other show. Should we test it out?' And I think that's going to be what opens the doors for these other services.""   Who loses?  Kaan Yigit runs Solutions Research Group, a consumer research firm in Toronto that conducts an annual survey of 1,000 Canadians about media and entertainment trends. When Yigit heard Disney Plus was coming to Canada, he added a question about participants' willingness to pay for the service.    The results showed that 30 per cent of participants would sign up — a proportion that roughly corresponds with the number of households with children under the age of 18. Yigit also asked that group about their willingness to pay for additional services.     ""You have 15 per cent who said they may drop their pay TV altogether, and 38 per cent said they may drop some channels.""  He notes that the cord-cutting trend — to unsubscribe entirely from cable providers such as Bell, Rogers, Shaw and Telus — has been growing in the marketplace for several years now, and will likely accelerate.      ""A typical household if they have cable or satellite or an IPTV subscription, they might be spending $70 to $90 a month on that,"" he says. ""So as new companies, new services come in, the consumer will have to look across the board at what they are spending, and make some tough decisions. I think this is a big concern to cable companies.""  More monthly bills  A poll sponsored by CBC News ahead of the upcoming federal election determined that Canadians' biggest concern these days is the cost of living. It ranked as the top worry for every segment of Canadians polled, including indigenous Canadians, new Canadians, first-time voters and visible minorities.  But Jessica Gallos-Pronyk has no reservations about adding to her family's monthly expenses. She's already signed up for emails from Disney to get updates about the coming service.    She hopes all the new options may even give consumers leverage, in terms of negotiating better deals with cable providers.  ""Perhaps coming down the road is an option to say to your cable provider, 'We're getting this, we're getting that, what else can you do for us as far as pricing?'""",entertainment
366,Morden fossil museum launches Cree-language audio guide,"The Canadian Fossil Discovery Centre has added a new language option to its audio guide for visitors wanting to learn more about the world's largest collection of marine reptile fossils: Cree.  The audio guide, which has existed for about three years, already had English and French options. When staff at the museum decided it was time for an addition, they wanted to go in a new direction.  ""We understand and know that Indigenous languages are incredibly important to our country,"" said executive director Peter Cantelon. ""Cree was something that came up as an opportunity for us to exercise our responsibility as a museum focused on heritage and education to do something as part of a First Nations [language] effort.""  The Morden, Man. museum is best known for Bruce, the world's largest publicly displayed mosasaur.    Cantelon said they chose Cree because statistically it's the most-spoken Indigenous language in Canada and Manitoba.  ""It made sense,"" he said. ""We saw it as an opportunity to contribute a little bit to the effort of preserving and educating in the area of Indigenous languages.""  Cantelon said developing the new language option and making it available on the app took about six months.  The museum worked with Indigenous Languages of Manitoba to ensure an accurate translation of the existing guide. The Winnipeg-based Bit Space Development created the app and Golden West Radio provided the studio space for recording audio. The museum also received funding through the province for the initiative.  ""It all came together as this all-Manitoba effort to put something spectacular out there that wasn't there before,"" said Cantelon.    Cantelon said he hopes the new audio guide will spark conversations with museums across the country about making their content as accessible as possible.  ""It's great to be in the museum, to see it — but there's so much content, so much creativity, and it's so vividly described, that anybody anywhere can download [through] the CFDC audio guide,"" said Cantelon. ""I think that's invaluable and I think that too often institutions fail to go beyond their walls. We have to if we want to truly fulfil our mandate as an educator.""  Cantelon said the museum has plans to keep adding language options to its audio guide, including German, Russian and Tagalog, to reflect other large communities it serves.  The CFDC audio tour app is available to download for free on iPhones or Android-based mobile devices.",entertainment
367,"'I am personally pro-life,' Scheer says, vowing not to 're-open' abortion debate","Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said today he is personally opposed to abortion — but a government led by him would not move to restrict access to the procedure.  Speaking to reporters in New Brunswick, Scheer, a practising Catholic, said that while he opposes abortion, a government led by him wouldn't enact any government legislation to ban the procedure or support the efforts of any Conservative backbench MP to limit the practice.  His declaration comes a day after three of the major party leaders pressured Scheer in a French election debate to say publicly how he feels personally about abortion. Scheer ducked the question last night, saying only that the abortion debate in Canada is settled.  ""My personal position has always been open and consistent. I am personally pro-life but I've also made the commitment that as leader of this party it is my responsibility to ensure that we do not re-open this debate, that we focus on issues that unite our party and unite Canadians,"" Scheer said Thursday at an announcement about tax credits for volunteer firefighters.  ""And that's exactly what I'll do and that's why I'll vote against measures that attempt to re-open this debate.""  Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau said today Scheer's reassurances aren't enough.  ""I'm going to fight for everyone, and I think women can see that. Andrew Scheer will not be there to defend their rights and that's very important. It's very important to understand the type of leadership that the various leaders have to offer,"" said Trudeau, campaigning today in Montreal.  Scheer has long identified as a social conservative. In 2005, he spoke out against same-sex marriage in a speech in the House of Commons. He also has said recently that the debate on same-sex marriage in Canada is settled.    When running for the party's leadership in 2017, Scheer told the anti-abortion group RightNow that he would allow ""freedom of conscience"" for backbenchers.  ""I think that's one of the things that makes the Conservative Party stronger, that we allow for a diversity of views on these issues within our own caucus and we don't tell anyone that they have to park their conscience or their faith at the door,"" he said, according to a transcript of the interview.  In that interview, Scheer also said he has always voted in favour of ""pro-life"" legislation.  ""I can assure you that I support the right to individual MPs to speak out and bring, introduce matters that are important to them, but our party policy is clear on that and I think in order to maintain unity of our caucus it's important that the prime minister respects that,"" he said.  Scheer has said he would allow individual Conservative MPs to introduce legislation they want to pursue, while affirming that he, as leader, would vote against legislation that seeks to limit abortion access.",politics
368,As they approach the ballot box Canada's veterans are told: Read the fine political print ,"Canada's veterans, many of whom shifted their support in 2015 from the Conservatives to the Liberals, are being encouraged during this election campaign to take a closer, more critical look at the details of the parties' election pitches.  Advocates who represent them say veterans have learned the value of the old maxim: Read the fine print.  The Liberal pledge in 2015 to give veterans the ""option"" of a lifetime pension for injuries sustained in the line of duty was a key element of the party's efforts to capture their votes, the advocates say.  Rightly or wrongly, that promise left many former soldiers with the impression that there would be a wholesale return to pensions-for-life — and those allowances would be equal to what was paid out under the old Pension Act.  Since then, there has been an extraordinary and divisive debate about the Liberal government's pension-for-life plan, implemented last spring. Among the skeptics is the Parliamentary Budget Office, which said the program will be slightly more generous than the one it replaces, but not a match for the pre-2006 system.  That's why the details are so important to veterans now, said veterans advocate Aaron Bedard.    ""There were just some fine details that people were willing to overlook [in 2015] for the sake of change,"" said Bedard, who was at the heart of a now-defunct class lawsuit over the disability pension system.  Bedard said that, in 2015, there was ""nowhere else"" for veterans disillusioned by the Conservatives to turn, apart from the Liberal Party.  The NDP and the Green Party will no doubt take umbrage at that claim, but Bedard said that, in the four years since, those parties haven't spent much time meeting with his group of former soldiers and advocates to understand their concerns.  However, the NDP and the Green Party now seem to be the ones most interested in upending the status quo on veterans. Both parties are calling for a review of veterans' services and benefits.  The Green Party platform specifically proposes ""a national re-examination of veterans' issues"" as well as a restoration of the pre-2006 benefit payment regime.  Conservatives promise changes  The Conservative platform, meanwhile, promises to create ""a reliable, dependable pension system"" that is fair to the most disabled veterans.  Defining ""fair"" should be a simple task, said one advocate.  Brian Forbes, chair of the National Council of Veterans Associations, said the disparity between the benefits paid to older and younger veterans is a key ballot box issue for his community.  ""What we are looking for from these political parties is for someone to stand up and say, 'Look, we should not have two or three layers of pension benefits,'"" said Forbes. ""We should have one model for all disabled veterans.""  Forbes pointed to the cases of two former soldiers, both double amputees — one wounded before the 2006 introduction of the New Veterans Charter (NVC) and one injured afterward. He said their compensation packages do ""not resemble one another.""    And many veterans still feel lingering resentment over Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's comment during a 2017 town hall. Defending his government's handling of the class-action lawsuit by veterans, Trudeau said former soldiers were ""asking for more than we are able to give right now.""  ""The outrage from that comment is still palpable,"" said Forbes. ""There are veterans who've never forgotten that exchange.""  For their part, the Liberals say they want to move beyond the pension-for-life debate and focus on wellness and care. They're proposing swifter and broader access to mental health services.  The party promises that each veteran would be eligible for $3,000 in free counselling services before they file a disability claim under a re-elected Liberal government.    The Liberals also say they would also simplify and shorten the benefits process to include ""automatic approval for the most common disability applications, including depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and arthritis, among others.""  Guy Gallant, a spokesman for the Liberals, said medical conditions that already have high approval rates (80 per cent or more) would be eligible for fast-track approval of benefits.  The Parliamentary Budget Office, in its recent analysis, warned that ""the perception of automatic approval may increase take-up or application rates"" for those programs. That could lead to bigger budgets for those programs.  The Liberal government appears to have laid the groundwork already by redesigning the post-traumatic stress disorder questionnaire filled out by medical professionals.  As CBC News reported last spring, the new form is shorter and more general, which troubles some psychologists. The  new, more generic application gives the bureaucracy more latitude to reject or approve the claim; when the new form was introduced, officials insisted they wanted to see swifter endorsements.    As of last November, the backlog of disability applications had grown to 40,000 — something both the New Democrats and Conservatives vow to fix. The Tories commit to doing it within 24 months.  The Liberals have acknowledged the problem, but defend their record.  ""We have worked hard to ensure veterans and their families get the services they need and benefits they deserve,"" said Gallant.  The Liberals also promise to ""move forward with a new rapid-response service staffed by social workers, case management counsellors and peer support workers.""  They say their mission would be to ""proactively reach out to every Canadian veteran to make sure that they know about the help that is available, and how to access it.""  The party is vague on what that policy would entail. ""This will likely involve the hiring of several hundred social workers, case management counsellors and peer support workers,"" said Gallant.  Promise more housing  There is a separate Liberal proposal for ""building new, purpose-built accessible and affordable housing units, with a full range of health, social and employment support for veterans who need extra help.""  It would be a $15 million per year commitment.  Jim Lowther is president of VETS Canada, an organization that works to get homeless veterans off the streets. He said he is intrigued but added the Liberals will have to realize that they cannot create ""barracks-style"" housing for former soldiers.  ""As long as it is community housing,"" he said. ""One of the things we've learned over the years is that veterans don't want to live together. A lot of veterans who are homeless have been out for 10 years and don't ... want to go back to a barracks setting.""  Lowther said he believes a stipend to help veterans having trouble paying rent might be just as effective as investing in bricks and mortar. It would, he said, prevent veterans from becoming homeless in the first place.  No matter which party is elected, Lowther said, the next government is going to have to wrap its head around a different definition of veteran homelessness.  Work on homelessness  ""People think of a guy holding a cup. That's not what it is like,"" he said. ""That might be one per cent of what it actually is. Most [homeless] veterans are couch surfing and doing other things.""  It has been tough, many veterans advocates say, to get all the parties to make the kind of sophisticated distinctions that Lowther talks about.  Which is why Forbes argues that, as veterans are making up their minds in the current election campaign, they should be asking all parties the same question: ""What do you mean when you say you were going to take care of us?""

369,How a school strike in Ontario could affect the federal election,"As hard as Ontario Premier Doug Ford is trying to stay out of the federal election campaign, the provincial political climate is threatening to drag him back into the spotlight in a big way.   That's because some 55,000 education workers in Ontario are poised to strike on Monday if they do not reach a contract deal by then. Such a strike has the potential to shut down classes for many of the two million students in the school system.   Even though education is a provincial issue, federal Conservatives are worried about the potential impact of a strike on their political hopes in Ontario, particularly in swing ridings around Toronto, because they keep hearing from voters at the doors that Ford's record makes them reluctant to vote for Andrew Scheer.  A school strike under Ford's government wouldn't help Scheer in any way.   The strike notice came from CUPE, which represents janitors, clerical staff and educational assistants in 90 per cent of Ontario's school boards. Some of those boards are already warning parents to make alternate child-care arrangements, and at least one district says it will definitely close schools on Monday should the strike begin.   Although Ontario Education Minister Stephen Lecce declined to speculate on what's behind the timing of the strike notice, Conservatives active in both the federal and Ontario parties say privately they are convinced it has everything to do with the election campaign.     They believe at the very least the union is trying to leverage the election — and the Ford government's fear of how a strike could hurt the federal party — to get a better deal. These Conservatives also wonder if there's an even bigger political play going on: an attempt to weaken Scheer's chances by forcing Ford back into the public eye.  Ford has been keeping a low profile for weeks, insisting he's too busy governing to get involved in the campaign. It's a sharp change of tone from the past year when he took many opportunities to swipe at Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau. But federal Conservatives admit an outspoken Ford is no longer of political advantage to their party.     The federal Liberals clearly agree and want to exploit this, which is why Trudeau keeps blatantly aiming to link Scheer to Ford in the minds of voters in Ontario and beyond.   If there is a strike on Monday, the Ford government would have two options:     Recall Queen's Park from its lengthy adjournment to bring in back-to-work legislation.   Let the strike continue.     If the government chooses legislation, Ford's party would have to face question period, putting a media spotlight on the polarizing premier, if he attends the sessions.     If the government chooses to let the strike go on, there's a chance that public opinion would not favour the union as parents scramble to figure out what to do with their children all day. There's equally a chance that public opinion turns squarely against Ford. Statistics provided by the union (and not disputed by the government) suggest their members earn on average $38,000 a year — not the sort of salary that lends itself to accusations that the workers are greedy.     There's still time to stave off a strike. The two sides have agreed to go back to bargaining table Friday afternoon and to negotiate through the weekend if necessary.    Lecce said the parties were close to a deal when talks broke off last weekend. But with the political stakes as high as they are right now, anything could happen.   I asked the union leaders in their news conference Wednesday whether the timing of their strike notice was connected with the election campaign. They didn't deny it.",politics
370,4 federal leaders fight to woo Quebec voters in fiery French-language debate,"Four federal leaders clashed on the environment, the economy and Quebec's place in Canada as they sought to appeal to Quebec voters in the TVA French-language debate on Wednesday night.  Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet appeared on TVA, one of Quebec's most widely watched networks and reaches a large audience of francophones outside of Montreal.  The station is also known for its unique debate format, which features one-on-one exchanges between the leaders that tend to make it particularly confrontational.  The debate started off with a fiery exchange between Blanchet and Scheer, who were asked to defend their positions on abortion. Blanchet said that he is unequivocally against opening up the abortion debate and that anyone in his party who had a differing position would be removed.  Scheer responded by saying he would always vote to support a woman's right to choose — but the ambiguity in his answer opened the floor to questions from all three leaders about what he, personally, believed.  Watch: Justin Trudeau presses Andrew Scheer on his views on abortion    The three-against-one dynamic continued into the second part of the debate, when Trudeau and Singh faced off on legislation regarding medically assisted dying.  Singh said that he felt the current criteria regarding the right to die are too restrictive and Trudeau said his government could be open to adjusting those restrictions.  When the floor was opened to all four, Singh asked the leaders to state their positions on a woman's right to choose and medically assisted dying. When Scheer wavered in his answer, Trudeau alluded that there were three leaders being clear in their positions and one not being direct.  Environment and economy  The leaders also faced tough questions from moderator Pierre Bruneau, who pointedly asked Scheer how he would explain to the 500,000 people who marched in the Montreal climate strike that he plans on being a champion of the oil and gas sector.  Scheer argued that the carbon tax ""doesn't work"" and that Canada's oil and gas industry has very high environmental standards. He struggled to give a clear answer when asked to defend his position on imposing a pipeline on Quebec.    Blanchet retorted that Scheer believes ""the free market and divine intervention"" would solve the climate crisis.  Trudeau was also asked how he would respond to Canadians who feel ""betrayed"" that he purchased the Trans Mountain pipeline. He responded that his government has a better record on the environment than any other government in Canadian history.  The leaders also clashed on asylum seekers, drug policy, and Quebec's place in Canada.  Trudeau needs to appeal to francophone voters outside of Montreal, a demographic whose support he is counting on to offset potential losses in other regions. Trudeau said he is against Bill 21, and hasn't ruled out intervening. He argued his government is committed to defending minority rights, drawing a comparison to francophones outside of Quebec.  Watch: Justin Trudeau, Jagmeet Singh and Yves-François Blanchet spar over Bill 21    Singh went slightly further, calling the bill ""discriminatory"" and calling on Quebec to not isolate itself. He largely focused his debate efforts on jabbing Scheer, saying a Conservative might cut taxes for some, but would severely slash services.  Blanchet makes his mark  The debate was especially high-stakes opportunity for Blanchet, a rookie debater, who is hoping the Bloc can make major gains in this election.     On his home turf, he challenged his counterparts to define Quebec's place in Canada, sending the three leaders scrambling to defend their positions in support of Quebec values.  When Scheer appealed to Quebecers to vote for Conservatives as the only way to get rid of a Trudeau government, Blanchet asked Scheer if that means he's accomplished nothing in the past four years, just because he didn't form a government in 2015.  Watch: Scheer tells Blanchet that Quebecers must elect Conservative MPs to defeat Trudeau    In his closing statement, he appealed for voters in Quebec to ""vote for women and men who resemble you"" and will defend Quebec.  Green Leader Elizabeth May and People's Party Leader Maxime Bernier were not invited to this debate.  ",politics
371,"Trudeau 'blackface' discussion surged online and then waned after 3 days, report finds","The day Time magazine published its report on a photo of Justin Trudeau wearing blackface, discussion exploded online. But less than a week later, online posts about the scandal had all but disappeared, according to new research from McGill University.   In fact, the online discourse around Trudeau's history of wearing blackface dropped off dramatically within three days, according to an analysis of social media posts published today by the Digital Democracy Project, an effort led by the Public Policy Forum and the Max Bell School of Public Policy at McGill University.    ""The story breaks and within a couple hours is trending on Twitter, there's a massive amount of coverage,"" said lead data analyst Aengus Bridgman. ""By the next day, it's about half. By the third day, it's about a quarter and it goes down from there to very little discussion by the end of the week.""   The findings are based on a dataset of 3 million tweets from the general public from Sept.17 to Sept. 28. A separate dataset of Facebook posts that mention Trudeau and blackface or link to a story covering the issue showed a similar sharp decline in just a few days.     Journalists and politicians on Twitter also followed a similar pattern, with a high amount of tweets about blackface in the first few days that dropped off significantly toward the end of the week.   ""We think that the brownfaceu002Fblackface story offers a pretty unique research moment in an election where an unexpected discourse emerges that nobody could have planned for,"" said Taylor Owen, the director of the Digital Democracy Project.   The researchers also took a look at accounts that are likely partisan based on the politicians they follow from each party. This showed that, while partisans of all stripes tweeted about the story, it was largely pushed by Conservative supporters.  An analysis of the hashtags used by accounts from these groups, however, show that most likely they were circulating among like-minded people: most of the blackface-related tweets coming from Conservative partisan accounts, for example, were only seen by other Conservative partisans, the report found.  ""Among partisan Twitter users, Conservatives are driving the conversation about the controversy,"" the report found. ""The blackface-related hashtags are disproportionately populated by right-leaning partisans who are largely speaking among themselves.""",politics
372,Do some province's votes count more than others? Your election questions answered,"Hundreds of you have texted your questions since we launched our election texting service earlier this week. Some common themes have emerged: the climate, carbon tax, health care, electoral reform, debts and deficits.  We've broken some of those out into separate articles — explaining the difference between debt and deficit and where the parties lie on electoral reform given the Liberals' broken 2015 promise.  But we've also rounded up some of the most intriguing questions here. You can ask us yours by texting ELECTION to 22222.  Do some province's votes count more than others?  It's not that they count for more, it's that provinces with greater populations have more seats in the House of Commons. More seats, more say.  Here's how it works: seats are allocated based on provincial population. A province with a large population, such as Ontario, will have more seats than, say, Prince Edward Island. Ontario has 121 seats — more than British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba combined.  The more seats Ontario voters give to a specific party, the greater chance that party's leader has of becoming prime minister.     What you need to know to vote in Canada's federal election    Since Confederation, the formula for determining how many seats a province gets has changed many times as the overall population of the country has grown and provincial populations have shifted. Some smaller provinces, including Saskatchewan, Manitoba, P.E.I. and New Brunswick, have a slightly higher number of seats than their population, as a percentage of national population, would dictate.  There's a simple explanation, says Gerald Baier, political scientist at the University of British Columbia. ""No province can have fewer seats in the House of Commons than it had senators at the time that it joined Confederation."" So absent a constitutional amendment, P.E.I. will never have fewer than four seats, even if its population decreases. Because of that, votes in P.E.I technically may count more than those in other parts of the country, if only because its average riding population is much smaller than the national average.  What's more, the 1985 Representation Act guaranteed each province would never have fewer seats than it had in 1976 or during the 33rd Parliament.       When should I be getting my voter card?  Elections Canada says it has now sent 28 million voter information cards out. If you are on the voters list, expect yours by Oct. 4.

You don't need your voter card to vote though. Here's all the forms of identification you can use.    Why do polling numbers change from outlet to outlet on the same day?  It depends on the way polls are conducted and what a poll's margin of error may be. Polling analyst Éric Grenier likens it to a pot of soup.   ""If you dip your spoon into the soup, no two spoonfuls will be identical. But even if one spoonful has a bit more pepper and the other has an extra piece of carrot in it, it still tastes generally the same. It is the same way with polls,"" he said.     See what the polls say right now with Poll Tracker    That means, even though there are variations, Grenier thinks they are still ""broadly reflective of the population as a whole.""      Have any parties mentioned making the CRA responsible to someone?  No party leader has made oversight of the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) a platform issue for 2019. The minister of national revenue is responsible for the CRA.  Earlier this year, the Liberals came under fire when CBC's The Fifth Estate and Radio-Canada's Enquête reported the CRA had settled out-of-court with KPMG clients who had dodged tens of millions of dollars in taxes as part of an offshore tax scheme.     Here are the tools you need to follow the federal election    In terms of oversight, the Canada Revenue Agency is overseen by a board of management, as is mandated by the Canada Revenue Agency Act. It also undergoes regular internal and external audits and evaluations. According to the CRA, the board of management oversees the organization and administration and the management of agency resources, services, property, personnel and contracts.   The overall performance of the CRA is publicly reported every year in a departmental results report.    What if I accidentally mark the wrong box when voting?  It happens. If you put a mark beside someone you didn't want to vote for or make a mistake like ripping your ballot, let a polling staffer know. Your ballot will then be counted as a ""spoiled ballot"" and will be kept secret. They are tracked, but the number of ""spoiled ballots"" aren't made public.

374,Trudeau's municipal handgun ban promise leaves key questions unanswered,"What would municipal handgun bans accomplish and how would they work?  These questions persist after Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau pushed gun control to the fore of his campaign again this week.   The Liberals say they would empower local governments to ""further restrict"" or outright ban handguns as part of a bigger plan to curb crime. At the same time, they've rejected the idea of a countrywide prohibition on handguns and haven't explained how local bans would be more effective.  The commitment left A.J. Somerset, the London, Ont.-based author of Arms: The Culture and Credo of the Gun, wondering if the Liberals are ""throwing a sop"" to mayors and advocacy groups calling for action on gun crime.     Somerset argues that ""there is no level on which it makes logical sense"" to bypass a national handgun ban in favour of local ones.  That's because it's not clear that even a countrywide ban would seriously reduce gun crime, Somerset said — a position also taken by the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police.  Certainly there could be some laudable outcomes, such as possibly increasing the street price of illegal handguns. But it wouldn't end the flow of weapons into Canada from the United States — a primary source of handguns used to commit crimes on this side of the border.  Take Toronto, for example. Police Chief Mark Saunders recently estimated that at least 80 per cent of illegal guns seized on the city's streets can be traced to sources in the U.S. Many of the remaining weapons are funnelled from other Canadian towns and cities.    That means that municipal bans would be even less effective at addressing the movement and sale of illegal weapons, Somerset said.   ""You can easily move a handgun in and out of a city, regardless of a ban. And criminals are already doing that every day.""  Cities in the United States have imposed handgun bans, only to have guns come in from outside.  Outlawing handguns in a city like Toronto would not safeguard against these realities, Somerset said.  Bill Blair, a Liberal candidate and minister of border security and organized crime reduction, suggested Tuesday that the party chose not to propose a national ban due to the high cost of a buyback program (there are more than 900,000 legally owned handguns in Canada) and because it would target law-abiding handgun owners.  The Liberal plan would allow individual municipalities to set parameters that work for them, Blair told reporters.    Legal uncertainty  But there are also questions about how local bans would work from a legal perspective. The Liberals have not explained how they would go about it.  Trudeau said Tuesday that the necessary ""tools"" would be made available to municipal governments, but it is not clear what that means.    There is the potential for some tricky legal wrangling, said Carissima Mathen, a professor and constitutional scholar at the University of Ottawa.  Prohibitions that come with the risk of punishment fall under criminal law, which is federal jurisdiction. But municipalities are creatures of the provinces. Therefore implementing local handgun bans would require at least some co-operation from all three levels of government, she said.    That could prove difficult in some cases. In Ontario, for example, Premier Doug Ford's Progressive Conservatives have rejected the idea of a handgun ban in Toronto, saying it would unfairly punish legal firearms owners.  Potential political hurdles aside, Mathen said it is certain that giving municipalities the option of outlawing handguns would, at the very least, require amendments to the federal Firearms Act and likely require changes to the Criminal Code as well.  ""We would need a framework of actual statutes,"" she said. ""I'd be very surprised if this policy was effected without some kind of law on the books.""    CBC News sent a series of questions to Trudeau's campaign, asking for clarity on whether a re-elected Liberal government would pursue legislative action to help municipalities.  In an emailed response, a spokesperson for the Liberal campaign declined to directly address any of the questions.  Instead, the spokesperson reiterated Trudeau's boilerplate messaging, saying that a Liberal government would ""work with provinces and territories"" to make it possible for those communities which want to further restrict or ban handguns to do so.   ""This is a priority commitment in the interests of public safety.""",politics
375,'It's terrifying': Calgary mayor calls for national groundswell against Quebec's religious symbols law,"Calgary city council voted this week to condemn Quebec's religious symbols law, Bill 21.  Bill 21 bars certain civil servants from wearing religious symbols at work. Critics have accused the law of undermining religious freedom and singling out minorities, although it remains broadly popular in Quebec. Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi has said the law targets some people — particularly Muslim women who wear the hijab — and not others.  In this Q&amp;A with Mayor Nenshi, he talks about why he thinks the Calgary resolution is only a good first step in challenging the law.  This interview has been edited and paraphrased for clarity and length. You can WATCH the complete interview here.    A: Why is this issue important to you?  Q: It's a question of fundamental human rights.  I was in New York last week and I was saying to people at some international meetings, ""Name a country in which there is a law that says you have to choose between your faith and your job, a law that restricts people from certain religions from having certain jobs in the public service.""  They were like, Saudi Arabia?     Montreal mayor says city will not disobey Quebec's proposed ban on religious symbols    When I said Canada, they were shocked. They said, ""Canada is supposed to be a paragon of pluralism, what is going on here?""  For me, I have been really surprised at the lack of conversation around Bill 21 and what it really means.  It's terrifying. It is flagrantly unconstitutional. It's violating the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in a really, really transparent way, and because of the notwithstanding clause, it is in some ways protected from legal challenge.     Calgary council unanimously votes to condemn Quebec's 'regressive' Bill 21    I was thrilled when the first question each of the party leaders got, when the federal election campaign was kicked off, was about Bill 21. And I was surprised when every one of them mouthed platitudes about human rights and dignity but were then very forceful that they are not going to do anything about it.  We deserve better from our federal leaders, and this is a good time for us to have that discussion.  Q: What would you like to hear from federal leaders?  A: To be fair, three of them have the same script, ""We are not going to do anything.""  Mr. Trudeau was slightly different, ""We are not going to do anything, right now.""  But really what I want to hear is a more forceful defence, because there are things the federal government can do. It is not just court challenges.     Fears of 'secularism police' raised by CAQ's last-minute changes to religious symbols bill    The federal government has the constitutional right to disallow provincial legislation. It is very rarely used, but they could do it.  They could do what the United States federal government did when certain states were being recalcitrant on civil rights legislation, which is withhold federal funding.  So there really are things they can do and they are too scared to do it. So it is time for Canadians to give them some courage.  Q: Will the Calgary motion make a difference?  A: Every little drop helps fill the puddle.  I was really proud of my city council. It would have been easy for them to say, ""It is not our jurisdiction, we have to worry about the garbage collection,"" and we do.  At city council, we disagree on some things. The fact that they did that unanimously was a really strong signal.     Here are the jobs subject to Quebec's proposed religious symbols ban (the list is longer than you'd think)    I thought it was helpful that they said, ""Not only are we going to do it, we are going to encourage every other city to do it.""  That's the critical part of this. We have to create a groundswell of Canadians who are speaking out for basic decency.  Q: In the spring, you didn't support the mayor of Montreal, who was against this bill. Why didn't you?  A: We were having a sidebar conversation and I said, ""Hey, how are you doing with all this Bill 21 stuff?""  She said, ""We are fighting it hard, but sometimes I feel isolated in this conversation.""  I wish I had gone back into that meeting of mayors, pounded my fist on the table and said, ""Guys, we have to support Mayor [Valérie] Plante, and we have got to make a statement today.""  I regret not doing that. It's not too late. I am calling on all municipalities to speak out against this.  Bill 21 is also an extraordinary encroachment by a provincial government on municipal rights. They are telling cities who they can and cannot hire. That's ridiculous.  Ultimately, the change has to happen with the federal government. If you want to be prime minister, you need to say how you are going to safeguard everyone's human rights.

376,Jagmeet Singh challenges man who urged him to 'cut off' his turban,"A campaigning Jagmeet Singh had a public encounter today with a man in Montreal who urged the NDP leader to ""cut off"" his turban to ""look like a Canadian.""  Singh was engaging prospective voters at Atwater Market this morning in front of media cameras and reporters when he was approached by the man.  After Singh shook his hand, the man leaned in and spoke to the NDP leader in English.  ""You know what? You should cut your turban off,"" he said. ""You'll look like a Canadian.""  ""Oh, I think Canadians look like all sorts of people,"" Singh replied. ""That's the beauty of Canada.""  ""Yeah, but..."" the man said — before Singh cut him off.  ""That's okay, I don't agree, sir,"" he said.  ""In Rome, you do as the Romans do,"" the man said.  ""Hey, but this is Canada, you can do whatever you like,"" Singh said, then walked away.  ""All right, take care, eh?"" the man called after him. ""I hope you win.""  Speaking to reporters earlier in the day, Singh once again addressed the issue of Quebec's controversial secularism bill ahead of tonight's TVA  leaders' debate.    The four leaders invited to the debate are expected to address Quebec's Bill 21, which would prevent public employees from wearing religious symbols — such as Singh's turban — on the job.  ""I'm hoping that by being in Quebec and saying, 'Hey listen, I got a turban and a beard and I'm out here talking about loving the language, fighting against climate crisis, investing in people, investing in universal medication for all,' that people can see ... maybe it isn't a good idea to have divisive laws that discriminate [against] people based on the way they look,"" said Singh.  Singh, the first member of a visible minority to lead a federal party, will take the stage tonight with Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau and Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet.    Singh, who faces significant pressure to defend his party's seats in Quebec, already has said an NDP government wouldn't challenge Quebec's religious symbols law in court — but he hopes his own public identity can change Quebecers' minds about wearing religious symbols.

377,Tonight's TVA debate could shake up the electoral map in Quebec,"In a few hours, four federal leaders will participate in what could be a watershed event in the current election campaign in one of the country's most volatile battlegrounds — Quebec.  The French-language debate organized by the TVA network will feature Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and Yves-François Blanchet of the Bloc Québécois.  It's likely to have a big audience. Ratings for TVA's debate beat by a significant margin ratings for the other French-language debate staged during the 2015 federal election campaign by a consortium of media outlets. And unlike next week's French-language debate, being organized by the leaders' debate commission, the TVA tilt will be unabashedly Quebec-focused.  So this debate could be the event that finally breaks the deadlock in the polls. Even if its English-speaking audience is limited to Ottawa reporters in the parliamentary press gallery, what happens in this debate still could have an impact on what happens in the rest of the country. Recall that in the 2011 election, it was the NDP's surge in Quebec that helped boost the party's fortunes elsewhere in Canada.  On the face of it, the Liberals appear to have a wide advantage in Quebec. The party leads in the province, with just over 34 per cent support in the CBC's Poll Tracker, an aggregation of all publicly available polling data. The Bloc trails in second place with 22 per cent, followed closely by the Conservatives at 21 per cent.  The New Democrats are polling at 11 per cent in Quebec. That puts them just ahead of the Greens, who are running in fifth place at nine per cent.  Green Leader Elizabeth May and People's Party Leader Maxime Bernier were not invited to participate in the TVA debate.  Liberals, Bloc fighting for seats  Though the two parties don't share a lot of the same voters, the Liberals and Bloc are fighting over a lot of the same seats. Many of those seats are on the fence right now.  The Poll Tracker estimates the Liberals are leading in 45 seats in Quebec. But nine of those are very tight races, while another six look competitive. As many as 15 seats in Quebec could be put at risk for the Liberals if Trudeau turns in a poor performance tonight.  On the flip side, the Liberals are projected to be trailing in five close ridings and competitive in another eight — so a strong performance by Trudeau could move as many as 13 seats into the Liberal column. That alone would put the Liberals on the cusp of a majority government.    But there's a lot at stake for Blanchet as well. The Bloc is the only party experiencing what could be charitably called momentum in this campaign. The party has picked up about three percentage points in Quebec since the campaign began. No other party has seen its support move by an average of more than a point in the province.  The Bloc is projected to be leading in 19 seats — nearly double the 10 it won in the last election. But more than half of those are considered competitive races, so Blanchet has a lot to lose tonight. He also has a lot to gain, as the Bloc is projected to be trailing in 17 close races. That's a wide range for the Bloc.  A lot of the closest races are Liberal-Bloc contests in and around Montreal, particularly the suburbs to the south and east of the city. Recent polls by Léger and Nanos Research give the Liberals a wide advantage in the Greater Montreal region, with about 40 per cent to 21 or 22 per cent for the Bloc — but what matters here is where that support is concentrated. The West Island of Montreal is to the Liberals what Alberta is to the Conservatives — a place where the party runs up huge numbers without winning any extra seats.  The Bloc's opportunity lies in the unpredictability of a lot of the races in Quebec. Léger shows a three-way tie between the Liberals, Conservatives and Bloc among francophone voters. A few points in one direction or the other could change the outcome in a lot of seats across the non-urban regions of the province.  Scheer, Singh playing smaller ball  While the stakes are high for Scheer and Singh as well, there are fewer seats at play for the Conservatives and NDP.  Conservative support is concentrated in just a few parts of Quebec. In a recent survey, Léger found the Conservatives holding a 21 point lead over the Liberals in the Quebec City region. The Poll Tracker puts the Conservatives ahead in 13 seats across the province; only four of those are considered competitive races, while the Conservatives are trailing in another six seats considered winnable for the party.  Those are still important seats for the Conservatives. Considering polling trends in the rest of the country, it's hard to imagine the Conservatives forming a majority government without 15 to 20 seats in Quebec.    For Singh, this debate might be his last opportunity to save the furniture. The NDP has shed a lot of support since the last election. In the ridings that were considered the most hotly contested in Quebec in 2015, the Angus Reid Institute finds the NDP is down 18 points. Those votes have been lost in roughly equal shares to the Liberals, Bloc and Greens.  The Poll Tracker does not put the NDP ahead in any ridings in Quebec and suggests it is only competitive in one. But it would not take much to give the NDP some hope — and May's absence does present Singh with an opportunity.  Léger finds that 30 per cent of Green supporters in Quebec list the NDP as their second choice. The Liberals were not far behind at 25 per cent, but it's clear that a strong performance by Singh — particularly on environmental issues — could pay dividends without May there to put forward her party's perspective.    If the NDP is able to shave five points off the Greens in Quebec, the Poll Tracker would put the New Democrats ahead in two ridings and competitive in as many as seven. That's a decent amount of furniture saved from the flames.  Maybe the debate doesn't end up moving voters in any significant way (nothing has so far). But in a province that has awarded different parties the most seats in each of the last three provincial and federal elections, the TVA debate provides the best opportunity to date to shake up this campaign.",politics
378,"For Trudeau and Scheer, tonight's French debate offers opportunity — and risks","Justin Trudeau steps on stage tonight for his first leaders' debate of the 2019 election — and a date with voters who may end up playing an outsized role in deciding whether he stays in power.  The debate sponsor, the French-language television network TVA, reaches a large audience of francophones outside Montreal. These are the voters Trudeau must recruit if the Liberals are to increase the number of seats they hold in Quebec to offset potential losses in other parts of the country.  ""Justin Trudeau understands very well that to get a majority, he needs to win over francophone voters outside the cities,"" said Guy Lachapelle, a political science professor at Concordia University.  ""The most recent polls show the Bloc Québécois is first among francophone voters and that's a problem for Trudeau and the Liberals.""  The Liberals held 40 seats in Quebec when the election was called. But the party's strength is heavily concentrated in Montreal and its suburbs.  That helps to explain why Trudeau is taking part in two French-language debates but only one in English, after refusing to take part in two others.    Tonight's debate pits Trudeau against Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, the NDP's Jagmeet Singh and new Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet. Green Leader Elizabeth May and Maxime Bernier of the People's Party were not invited.  Language and common interests  The Liberals are hoping Trudeau will be able to exploit an advantage he enjoys over Scheer: the Conservative leader will be debating in his second language.  But the decision to take part in two French language debates also carries risks for Trudeau — risks which may become obvious when the leaders square off, one-on-one, on immigration, Quebec's place in Canada, the economy and the environment.       Got questions about the election? We've got the information you need. Text ""ELECTION"" to 22222 for our election toolkit. And if you've still got questions, ask us.    ""Justin Trudeau needs to convince Quebeckers — especially unilingual francophones — that he shares common interests with them,"" said Carl Vallée, a former spokesman for Stephen Harper and a partner in the public affairs firm Hatley Strategies in Montreal.  Vallée said that, for Trudeau, connecting with the francophone audience means avoiding (as much as possible) any discussion of Bill 21, the controversial provincial law which bars Quebec public servants — including teachers and police officers — from wearing visible symbols of their religious faith.    The law, introduced by Premier Francois Legault's Coalition Avenir Quebec government, is popular throughout the province. And it's become a major rallying point for the Bloc's Blanchet — who, unlike the other leaders, isn't running to be prime minister and whose party has no interest in forming a government.  ""He will talk about religious symbols as often as he can in the debate,"" said Yolande James, the former Quebec Liberal cabinet minister who is now a political commentator with Radio-Canada. ""You can expect Blanchet to position the Bloc as the only party that will protect Quebec's right to make these decisions. It's a wedge issue for him.""    Lachapelle said he believes Trudeau also will be challenged to defend his record on the environment.  ""He will have to explain why he bought a pipeline for Alberta and is not promoting a new electrical grid for Quebec's hydro,"" he said.  And then there are the lingering questions about Trudeau's leadership. James said Trudeau can expect to be targeted over his handling of the SNC Lavalin file as part of a broader attack on his judgment.    ""The risk for him is that, in this election, he's being chased by the other leaders,"" he said. ""They are going to come at him from all angles, not just on SNC Lavalin but over the number of times he's appeared in blackface, for example.""    If the stakes are high for Trudeau, they might be even higher for Scheer and Singh.  Appeal to Quebecers  The Conservatives hold 11 seats in and around Quebec City and up the Saguenay Valley. The party hopes to pick up some of the ridings strung along the north shore of the St. Lawrence River.  Scheer said he's just happy Trudeau is showing up after skipping a debate in English last month.  ""It's a big step for him,"" Scheer said during a campaign stop on Tuesday, adding he intends to highlight what he called four years of Liberal scandal and corruption.  ""My message to all Quebecers, to all Québécois, is that a Conservative government will respect the right of provinces. We believe in respecting provincial jurisdiction and that we are committed to addressing some specific challenges and issues in Quebec, like the single income tax return.""  Vallée said Scheer's best strategy is to reach beyond the studio.  ""He needs to speak directly to voters. Focus less on the other leaders and more on the camera,"" he said. ""This debate is the best way to get to nationalist, right-of-centre voters who went massively to the CAQ in the provincial election.""    Singh faces the bleakest prospects heading into the debate. Eight years ago, the NDP under Jack Layton won 59 seats in the province. In the 2015 campaign, that number dropped to 16. Polls suggest the NDP is in danger of being shut out of the province entirely on Oct. 21.  ""I am looking forward to having an opportunity to confront Mr. Trudeau because he has broken promises,"" Singh told reporters in French at a campaign stop on Tuesday.  Bloc re-emerges as a force  But the real challenge for both the Conservatives and the New Democrats is the re-emergence of the Bloc as a force in Quebec.    Lachapelle said he believes the Conservatives will be happy to hold the seats they already have — but even that may depend on Scheer's ability to convince voters that he has a long-term view of Quebec's place in Canada, one that goes beyond the traditional notion of ""distinct society"" to embrace the kind of nationalist pitch being made by Legault's government.  Quebec has always had a profound influence on federal politics. More prime ministers have come from Quebec than any other province; both Justin Trudeau and Pierre Trudeau launched their political careers there. And Quebec voters exhibit an uncanny knack for identifying and riding incoming political waves like practiced surfers — as they did with Jack Layton's NDP in 2011.    It all suggests Trudeau and Scheer will be spending much of the remaining three weeks of the campaign in the province.   Each will be looking to counter the growing popularity of the Bloc, trying to present the party as a sovereigntist entity out of step with Quebec voters who no longer see independence as their ultimate political goal.

379,Conservatives say Trudeau event broke Toronto's political campaign rules,"A long-time Conservative MP and candidate for re-election has written to Toronto's integrity commissioner asking her to investigate a Justin Trudeau campaign event he says contravened the city's rules on partisan activities during an election period.  In a letter to Valerie Jepson, Peter Kent, who has represented the riding of Thornhill, asks the city's ethics watchdog to probe ""the improper use of taxpayer funded city facilities"" by the Liberal Party.  The letter refers to an event on Sunday evening where Trudeau met with campaign volunteers gathered at Nathan Phillips Square.   According to Toronto's 'Use of City Resources During an Election Period Policy,' city facilities and infrastructure can't be used for any election-related purpose by a candidate, registered third-party advertiser or political party. It also prohibits signs from being ""erected or displayed"" on or beside a city park or facility run by the city.    According to the policy, city ""facilities"" include any space managed or operated by the city, including city hall, civic centres and civic squares including Nathan Phillips Square.  The regulations were passed in February 2018.  Aimed primarily at municipal and school board campaigns, the policy also applies to provincial and federal election periods in order ""to preserve the public trust and integrity in the elections process.""   Rules aim to avoid 'unfair advantage'  ""This policy allows the city to balance the need for freedom of expression and assembly of candidates and its legal responsibility to ensure that no candidate, registered third-party advertiser or political party is provided with an unfair advantage,"" the policy reads.  During Sunday's event, dozens of Liberal volunteers and supporters gathered in Nathan Phillips Square, many carrying campaign signs for local Toronto and area candidates.    When Trudeau arrived, wearing a bomber jacket with the Liberal logo, he stood atop a small podium, made brief remarks, then worked his way through a crowd of people lining up to take selfies with the Liberal leader. The crowd swelled as passersby appeared to join the group.  ""While Mr. Trudeau's past actions indicate that he believes there are one set of rules for him, and another set of rules for everyone else, I am confident you agree that all candidates and campaigns should be held to the same standard,"" Kent wrote in his letter.  ""I will look forward to your response about what appropriate action is being taken to address Mr. Trudeau's contravention of the resolution passed by Toronto City Council.""  Liberal Party campaign spokesperson Joe Pickerill said an ""informal meet and greet"" with Trudeau was planned for a venue opposite the Nathan Phillips Square on Queen Street West.   ""That opportunity swelled in numbers and moved organically across the street.  The leader dropped by, spent 15 minutes with them and left,"" he said in an email.    Rules for partisan activities  Toronto's chief communications officer Brad Ross could not say if any breach of the rules may have occurred, and could not immediately say if the integrity commissioner has jurisdiction to investigate the activities of a federal campaign.  He is not aware of any special permit being granted for the event.  According to Toronto's rules, no permits are to be issued to use city facilities to promote, support or oppose a particular candidate, registered third party advertiser or political party.   Campaign materials can't be distributed on or in city facilities or at city events, but they can be distributed on sidewalks, during all-candidates meetings, at public parks and at some city managed public squares, including Nathan Phillips Square.  Informal media scrums are also permitted in public or common areas, including Toronto City Hall, and public squares, including Nathan Phillips Square, as long as they don't include loud speakers or disrupt city business.

His speech, made entirely in French, was followed by a lengthy round of applause from elected members and a group of Indigenous leaders watching from the gallery. Opposition politicians also offered words of apology.    The apology was the first of 142 recommendations made in the report issued Monday by retired Superior Court justice Jacques Viens.  Legault said he would study all the recommendations and work with Indigenous groups to improve the situation.    In the report, Viens said it is ""impossible to deny"" Indigenous Peoples are victims of ""systemic discrimination"" in accessing public services.  He said improvements are needed throughout the public service, including in policing, social services, corrections, justice, youth protection and mental health services, as well as to the school curriculum to properly reflect the history of First Nations and Inuit in the province.  Viens's inquiry was launched in 2016 by the then Liberal government, following a Radio-Canada investigation into allegations of police misconduct against Indigenous women in Val-d'Or, a city 500 kilometres northwest of Montreal.  'We'll see how far it'll go'  Indigenous leaders and advocates welcomed the apology from the premier, but they also stressed the importance of making concrete changes to government services.   ""We've been ready for many, many years to work with the government. And now, this announcement today, we'll see how far it'll go,"" said Verna Polson, grand chief of the Algonquin Anishinabeg Nation Tribal Council.  Polson, an English speaker, said she was disappointed Legault didn't deliver a portion of his apology in English.    She called on the premier to ensure the women who came forward in Val-d'Or aren't overlooked, as well.    ""The women, they need their justice. We're always going to talk about it. We're always going to push for it.""  Huron-Wendat Grand Chief Konrad Sioui pointed out there have been many reports in the past, with similar recommendations, including the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls (MMIWG).    But he said the Quebec report represents an end to an ""age of innocence"" in the province, where misdeeds were often attributed to English Canada.  '''We're not like those English guys you know.' This is the kind of message we've heard for a long, long time,"" he said.  ""Today, there's a real effort from the premier and the government itself to excuse themselves and ask pardon. Now it's up to us to say, how are we going to implement the new chapter.""",politics

382,Andrew Scheer met 5 undecided Canadian voters. Here's what happened,"Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer sat down today with five undecided voters from across the country to answer questions about how he would tackle the issues that matter most to them.  The exchange was the second instalment of The National Presents: Face to Face with the Federal Party Leaders — a CBC News feature that gives five undecided voters five minutes each to grill one of the four federal party leaders.  Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau's turn in the hot seat came Monday evening.  One of the undecided voters — Genna Evelyn, a 35-year-old married immigration lawyer with a two-year-old child and a second on the way — said she wants to give the Conservatives a chance but has concerns about how her vision of a welcoming and open Canada might differ from Scheer's.     Watch The National Presents: Face to Face With the Federal Party Leaders on CBC News Network, CBCNews.ca, the CBC News App (iOS or Android) or CBC Gem at 8 p.m. ET, followed by highlights on The National at  9 p.m. ET on CBC News Network, and at 10 p.m. ET on CBC-TV and online.    Evelyn asked the Conservative leader what a Scheer government would do to help immigrants integrate into Canadian society and stay here.  Watch: Scheer answers questions on immigration from Genna Evelyn:     Bryan Stewart, of Surrey, B.C., is a married 43-year-old father of an eight-year-old daughter who owns and operates a small business. Stewart said that he worries about the cost of living and feels that Liberal policies are making it difficult for middle-class Canadians to make ends meet.  Stewart asked Scheer if he would commit to legislative changes that would crack down on foreign ownership of Canadian real estate so that people like him can afford to buy a house.  Watch: Scheer answers questions on housing affordability from Bryan Stewart:     Umair Ali, of Brampton, Ont., said he aligns with the Conservatives' social and fiscal policies. But as a first-generation Canadian, the 30-year-old expressed concerns about inclusion and wondered where someone like him would fit in with the Conservative Party.  Watch: Scheer answers questions on inclusion from Umair Ali:     Markus Harvey, 50, and his family have lived for the past 100 years in Maugerville, N.B., a town that experienced extreme flooding in 2018 and 2019. He had questions around how a Conservative government would steer Canada's fight against climate change.  Watch: Scheer answers questions on climate policy from Markus Harvey:    Maggie Cywink, 57, of White Fish River First Nation on Ontario's Manitoulin Island, was a special adviser to the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls Inquiry.

Methodology:  The undecided voters chosen to question the leaders have been carefully selected from across the country and represent the diversity of the electorate groups — regionally, racially and ethnically, socio-economic, different ages, different priorities. Each voter is undecided, but open to voting for the leader they are across from and looking for the answers they need for a question that relates to their lives.  We invited leaders who are running national campaigns. We provided a date range in order to have them all recorded and aired in the span of one week. Mr. Bernier initially declined our offer to participate due to scheduling issues and we have since invited him for an interview later in the campaign.  Mr. Blanchet was not invited as the Bloc Quebecois is only running candidates in one province.  Need help preparing for election day? We've got the information you need.

383,Liberals broke their promise. But where do other parties stand on electoral reform?,"As you send us your election questions, we've been hearing a lot about electoral reform. It was a central pillar of the Liberals' 2015 promises, but was ultimately abandoned.  Not much has been said this campaign, but that doesn't mean the parties don't have views on it.  What did the Liberals promise before? Where do they stand now?  During the 2015 election, Liberal leader Justin Trudeau campaigned on it being the last run under the first-past-the-post system. He promised an ""electoral system that does a better job of reflecting the concerns, the voices of Canadians from coast to coast to coast, and give us a better level of governance."" While running for Liberal leadership in 2013, he said he preferred preferential voting.     Got questions about the election? We've got the information you need. Text ""ELECTION"" to 22222 for our election toolkit. And if you've still got questions, ask us.    The Liberals undertook extensive consultation, including convening a multi-party House committee, where the majority of members recommended a referendum on a form of proportional representation.  But Trudeau ultimately cancelled his electoral reform promise in early 2017, saying no clear choice had emerged for an alternative system — to calls of ""betrayal"" from his opponents. Trudeau also ruled out a referendum.  He said he may be open to models other than proportional representation — but said any further move won't happen until after this election. There is nothing about electoral reform in the Liberals' 2019 platform.    What do the other parties want?  Conservatives are open to electoral reform, but insist a referendum must come first — they say it's their ""bottom line"" requirement. The party does not favour any type of system in particular.  The NDP propose a mixed member proportional representation system in place by the next election. After an election is held under this system, they would then hold a referendum to see if Canadians want it to stay. The party would also lower the voting age to 16.     Here's how the parties compare on other top issues    The Greens also want electoral reform but propose launching a ""citizens assembly"" to find an appropriate alternative to the current model. The party would put any new system in place by the next election. It too would lower the voting age to 16.  The Bloc also got a seat on the aforementioned House committee, where they advocated for a referendum.  And the People's Party said it doesn't have any position on electoral reform.  Why do some parties want electoral reform?  It's pretty clear why for smaller parties like the Greens — different voting systems would mean more seats in the House of Commons. The Greens got 3.4 per cent of the vote countrywide in 2015 but that only translated to one seat.   Under alternative methods, the number of seats won would more closely reflect the overall percentage of votes received. The Greens have never come close to matching their vote share with seat share.   Parties also complain that under the current model, a party can win a majority government with a minority of the votes (the Liberals won a majority in 2015 with just 39.5 per cent of the vote countrywide) — and that this discourages people from thinking their vote counts. They feel reform would allow a wider range of voices to be heard.    What is a mixed-member proportional system?  This is the only system that's specifically being proposed by a party — the NDP. The method is currently used in New Zealand. It would mean electors would cast two votes — one for their local candidate and the other for a party, also known as a regional candidate.  The local candidate would be chosen just like they are right now. But the vote for the party or regional candidate would be used to top up representation in the House. This would help accurately align seat count with popular vote. That means if a party got 10 per cent of the votes nationally, it would get 10 per cent of the seats in the House.  Where do we vote differently?  While federal elections in Canada use the first-past-the-post system, there have been examples of alternative voting systems used in provincial and municipal elections.  Preferential voting (also known as a ranked ballot) was used in elections in British Columbia, Alberta and Manitoba in the past but the provinces stopped in the mid-1950s.     What you need to know to vote in Canada's federal election    London, Ont., voted in the 2018 municipal election using a ranked ballot. Ontario changed the rules in 2016 to allow municipalities to vote by ranking their ballot if they wished.  These types of ballots have also been used to choose leaders during party leadership elections.    What do referendums look like?  Several provinces and municipalities have held referendums on changing how we vote — but not many have resulted in change.  Recent provincial examples include April's referendum on Prince Edward Island, where the province voted to keep first-past-the-post and British Columbia's 2018 referendum, where voters rejected reform for the third time in 13 years, despite campaigning from Premier John Horgan.      Here are the tools you need to follow the federal election     Quebec is proposing its own referendum on electoral reform to coincide with its provincial election in 2022.  Kingston, Ont., held a vote during its 2018 municipal election to implement a ranked ballot. While 62.9 per cent of electors voted in favour, less than 50 per cent of eligible electors voted, so it wasn't considered binding. Council decided to honour the results of referendum anyhow. The city will vote by ranked ballot in 2022.  How much would a referendum cost?  In 2016, Marc Mayrand, Election Canada's then chief electoral officer, estimated a referendum would cost about $300 million.   Money would be saved if it was held in tandem with a general election but that can't happen under current Referendum Act rules.

384,"Ontario education workers to resume talks with province, school boards on Friday","Contract talks between the province, school boards and educational support staff represented by the Canadian Union of Public Employees will resume on Friday, the union says.  CUPE, which represents some 55,000 education workers in Ontario, said in a news release on Wednesday night that it will strike on Monday if there's no deal by then.  Talks are scheduled to begin on Friday at 4:30 p.m.  Earlier on Wednesday, CUPE announced its intention to escalate its current job action to a full-on strike on Monday, but also invited the province and Council of Trustees' Associations back to the bargaining table.  It also offered to bargain throughout the weekend to avoid labour disruption.  ""We all know that the best outcome for everyone — students, parents, families, workers — is for this dispute to be resolved at the bargaining table,"" Laura Walton, president of CUPE's Ontario Council of School Board Unions, said in a news release.  ""We're ready to do the hard work to get there, but we need the province and school boards to be equally committed to a deal, rather than a strike. If we have to, we will be ready to walk out on Monday morning, but our focus this weekend will be on the hard work needed to achieve a settlement.""    The announcement on Wednesday morning prompted some Ontario school boards to warn parents about possible school closures.  Walton said the union is prepared to do ""the hard work"" to avoid such a walkout.  ""Make no mistake — CUPE members are prepared to go on strike. We are ready,"" Walton said. ""We are ready to do the hard work to prevent this action.""  Support staff, including clerical staff, custodians, educational assistants, early childhood educators and more from 63 school boards in the province, began a work-to-rule campaign on Monday after last-minute, weekend contract talks failed to produce a deal.  Since Monday, Walton said, it has become clear to the union that job action is affecting services in schools.  ""Across the province, boards are cutting more services and putting students at greater risk,"" Walton said. ""This is not safe and this is not sustainable. We have no choice but to invoke the next step in the legal progress we follow for school board bargaining.""    Early Wednesday afternoon, Education Minister Stephen Lecce said he thought all parties were fairly close to a deal when talks broke off Sunday. He said the province has ""provided some latitude"" on issues such as job security and compensation, but also acknowledged sick days and extended leaves remain a sticking point.  ""I think we've demonstrated some reasonableness at the table,"" Lecce told reporters at Queen's Park.  Lecce cited retention of educational assistants as a priority, and said the government's actions through the current bargaining process have reflected that with offers of steady pay increases.   Walton acknowledged the province views worker absenteeism and use of sick days as a sticking point in the talks, and said the union is prepared to talk about the issues that lead to sick calls: high class sizes, classroom violence and excessive workloads, for example.   Education workers among lowest paid in system, union says  CUPE Ontario president Fred Hahn also noted at Wednesday's CUPE news conference that the education workers are among the lowest paid in the public education system, making an average of $38,000 per year.   As the union representatives did, Lecce expressed a willingness to resume talks and said negotiators for the province are ready to meet as early as today.  ""I remain cautiously optimistic"" a deal can be reached before a full-scale walkout, he said.  School boards are already sending notices to parents warning of a potential strike.  The Waterloo Catholic District School Board has said that it will close its schools on Monday if the strike goes ahead.  ""As CUPE represents 1,100 of our school-based staff, we would not be able to safely operate our schools,"" said the board in a statement on its website.    The York Region District School Board, just north of Toronto, is ""strongly"" encouraging parents to make child care arrangements.  ""This strike action may result in school closures,"" said a notice from the board posted online. The Peel District School Board, just to the west of the city, issued a similar notice Wednesday.  'What we want here is pressure'  CUPE is just one of the unions locked in talks with Doug Ford's Progressive Conservative government.  So far, none has been able to reach a deal, raising concern that a widespread school strike could happen.  Hahn said that should a full walkout occur on Monday, CUPE hopes teachers would opt not to cross the picket lines.  ""That would be ideal,"" Hahn said. ""What we want here is pressure to resolve these issues.""    While the Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario said it stands in solidarity with CUPE education workers, president Sam Hammond did not call on members to join the strike.  Instead, he encouraged Ontario's elementary teachers to join the picket lines before and after the school day.  In a statement to CBC Toronto, the Ontario English Catholic Teachers' Association also said it ""fully supports"" CUPE education workers, but that it expects members to continue working in the case of a strike.  Hahn was also asked about whether a strike would impact voting in the upcoming federal election, with hundreds of schools slated to serve as polling stations.  Hahn said Elections Canada will ""have to deal with that,"" but added that CUPE members ""won't impede the democratic process.""",politics
385,Record number of women elected in Northwest Territories,"A record number of women have been elected to the Northwest Territories 19th Legislative Assembly — making it the jurisdiction with the highest proportion of women legislators in Canada.  Nine of 19 MLAs elected on Tuesday are women, a far cry from the two elected in the last election in 2015.  ""We have made history in the Northwest Territories. So that's huge and that's exciting,"" said Caroline Cochrane, who was also re-elected Tuesday  She said women focus on family and women's issues, as well as education, health care and child care. The N.W.T.'s ailing child protection system, which has been blasted in auditor general reports, was a hot button election issue. Debate around the future of a potential N.W.T. university also had candidates and constituents talking.  Julie Green, who was also re-elected in Yellowknife Centre, agreed that having more women in office will change the conversation in the legislature.  ""I think you'll see that women work differently together and we may also have different priorities,"" said Green. ""And that there will be a different tone to this assembly than there was to previous assemblies. That's what I'm looking forward to.""  Historically, the most sitting female MLAs in the Northwest Territories was three. The last legislature adopted the goals of having at least 20 per cent women MLAs following the 2023 election and at least 30 per cent after the 2027 vote.  ""We have that now. It's so amazing,"" said Green.  Lesa Semmler, a nurse and advocate for missing and murdered Indigenous women, took one of two seats in Inuvik. She was ecstatic about the number of women elected.  ""We told the Northwest Territories tonight, we don't need to be given seats. We'll put our names forward, we'll get elected,"" she said to cheers on Tuesday night.    The territory does not have a party system, but rather a consensus government where MLAs select cabinet and premier. On Oct. 18 candidates will put their names forward for consideration. The vote will take place Oct. 24 (the dates are subject to approval from the 19 elected members).    Cochrane previously served on cabinet and hopes to hold a ministerial position in the 19th Assembly.   ""We've never had more than one cabinet [member] as a woman"" she said. ""I'm hoping that one of the women that gets elected will be sitting beside me in cabinet. That's my goal.""  The other women elected are engineer Katrina Nokleby, photographer and public servant Caitlin Cleveland and lawyer Caroline Wawzonek in the Yellowknife ridings.   In the N.W.T. communities, former Salt River First Nations chief Frieda Martselos, self-government negotiator Diane Thom, and newcomer Paulie Chinna took seats.      Women work differently together and we may also have different priorities.  - Julie Green, re-elected MLA     Incumbent Kevin O'Reilly was re-elected and said the number of women elected bodes well for the future of the Northwest Territories.  ""I'm very, very pleased that we're going to have more women in the assembly and hopefully more women in cabinet,"" he said. ""I think it will change the way we make decisions.""    Jane Groenewegen, who was unseated in 2015 after serving as an MLA in Hay River for 20 years, remembers when she was first elected thinking she wanted to have it all.  As a mother to young children then, she said her advice to women is to try to keep balance.  ""Don't lose sight of who you are. Don't let this system kind of gobble you up,"" she said.  ""Remember who you are. You have an opportunity to step onto that stage and to serve for a period of time.""",politics
386,UAW says GM's latest contract proposal falls short as strike continues through 3rd week,"The 16-day strike by auto workers has cost General Motors about $1 billion US according to at least one estimate, while a parts shortage forced the company to close pickup truck and transmission plants in Mexico.  Spokesman Dan Flores confirmed that production at the factories in Silao, Mexico, ended Tuesday morning, affecting 6,000 workers.  The strike has cost GM just over $1 billion thus far, JP Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman estimated Tuesday in a note to investors.  On Tuesday it appeared that both sides were apart on an agreement that could end the strike by 49,000 workers, which has halted GM's U.S. factories since Sept. 16, and caused layoffs in Ontario. A top UAW negotiator wrote in a letter to local union leaders that a contract proposal from the company fell short of union demands.  Vice-President Terry Dittes says in the letter that the proposal made Monday night was lacking on wages, health care, use of temporary workers, job security and other items. He wrote that the company wanted the union to make concessions.  Dittes wrote that the union responded Tuesday with a counterproposal and is awaiting a reply.  GM wouldn't comment specifically on the negotiations, issuing a statement similar to one that it has sent out through the strike.  ""We continue to negotiate and exchange proposals, and remain committed to reaching an agreement that builds a stronger future for our employees and our company,"" the statement said.  Mexican plant shutdown  The Mexican plant shutdowns mean that GM has lost any new supplies of its light-duty Chevrolet Silverado, the company's top-selling U.S. vehicle. Earlier GM had to close a Mexican engine plant and an assembly plant in Canada due to the strike.  The strike by over 49,000 union workers is now in its third week, and both sides are feeling the impact. Workers are having to get by on $250 per week in strike pay instead of their normal base pay of about $1,200 per week.  GM's losses are mounting each week the strike continues, costing about $480 million in the first week and another $575 million in the second, JP Morgan's Brinkman wrote. The company is losing $82 million per day, he calculated.  GM books revenue from building vehicles as soon as they change hands from the factory to the company that ships them to dealers. So revenue has been counted already for nearly all vehicles that are in dealer hands. Many dealers stocked up before the strike and report having plenty of inventory.    The Silao plant shutdown puts more pressure on GM to bring an end to the strike, but it has to balance the short-term losses against extra costs that could come from settling the strike, said Kristin Dziczek, vice-president of the Center for Automotive Research, an industry think-tank in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  The strike has already caused GM to lay off 1,850 workers and shut down its assembly plant in Oshawa, Ontario.  Another 730 were laid off from an engine plant in St. Catherine's, Ontario, according Unifor, the Canadian auto workers union.  Brinkman wrote that GM could recover some of its lost profits by increasing production in the fourth quarter once the strike comes to an end. But the company likely will be limited to add production of vehicles that already are in high demand or where new models are being launched, such as GM's heavy-duty Chevy Silverado or GMC Sierra pickup trucks, Brinkman wrote.  GM's pickup truck and large SUV plants already were working six or seven days per week to meet demand before the strike, so increasing production will be difficult.",business
387,"Economy flat in July as oil and gas sector down, Statistics Canada says","Statistics Canada says the country's real gross domestic product was essentially unchanged in July as weakness in oil and gas extraction offset gains in service industries.  Economists had expected growth of 0.1 per cent, according to financial markets data firm Refinitiv.  The flat reading for the month came as goods-producing industries fell 0.7 per cent for the month.  The mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction sector pulled back 3.5 per cent in the month, the largest decrease in the sector since May 2016.  Oil and gas extraction fell 3.0 per cent in July due in large part to a shutdown of some of Newfoundland and Labrador's offshore production facilities for a large part of the month as a result of maintenance issues.  Meanwhile, Stastics Canada says the services-producing industries rose 0.3 per cent.    One economist suggested not reading too much into the overall flat growth seen in July.  ""Today's headline was definitely soft, but the underlying story was not,"" TD Bank senior economist Brian DePratto said in a commentary.   ""If it weren't for the drag from the energyu002Fmining sector, we'd have had a repeat of June's solid performance, even with the relative lack of growth breadth.  If you're looking for generalized weakness in Canada's economy, today's report ain't it,' he wrote.  DePratto also said the latest report on the economy isn't likely to produce movement by Bank of Canada on interest rates.  ""Governor [Stephen] Poloz and company are looking for signs of the global trade and manufacturing slowdown manifesting in the Canadian data. For now, the waiting game continues,"" he said.",business
388,"Deficits can mean pain ahead, or they can be an investment in the future: Don Pittis","Should Canadians be worried when elected officials, or politicians who want your vote, promise to spend money they don't have?  The fear that the credit crunch and recession of 2008 would turn into something much worse accorded governments new licence to put taxpayer-backed money to work in the economy.  And that new freedom to shell out has by no means been limited to ""tax and spend"" leftists.  Despite long time lip service to thrift, the U.S. has been a deficit-spending world leader, bailing out banks, buying up bonds to release more private sector cash into the economy, cutting taxes without commensurate cuts in public outlays, and harbouring off-balance-sheet future expenses such as pension liabilities.  With Republicans in charge, fiscal and monetary stimulus continued even as the North American economy roared and the deficit grew.  Now whether, or how much, governments should borrow from the future to spend immediately has become an issue in the Canadian election.  'Credit card campaign'  ""We're choosing to invest in middle-class Canadians, invest in people's communities, because, quite frankly, that is what has worked over the past four years,"" said Liberal leader Justin Trudeau while announcing new spending promises that crowd the New Democrats on left.  According to the Liberal Party's own calculations, which, since no one knows the future, are inevitably only rough estimates, the new spending plan would push the deficit in the 2020-21 fiscal year above $27 billion.      Speaking for the Conservatives, Ontario MP Pierre Poilievre offered a scathing response.  ""This is Justin Trudeau's credit card campaign,"" said Poilievre. ""He expects Canadians to believe that money falls out of the sky or grows on trees.""    But Trudeau may not be alone. As Conservative leader Andrew Scheer bids for votes, the cost of his promises is also mounting.  All of which leads us to the question of whether government spending is ultimately good or bad for a country. And while there are political advocates for both sides, governments rarely avoid spending more than they earn in revenue.  ""Government is not the solution to our problem, government is the problem,"" U.S. President Ronald Reagan famously said in his inaugural address. Ironically the economic boom during the Reagan era was funded by public borrowing, as tax cuts transferred public wealth to the private sector. During his two terms as president, the U.S. public debt tripled.  Diefenbaker and Queen Isabella  Historically, Canada's Conservative-led governments have seen a place for public spending. The Roads to Resources plan by the government of John Diefenbaker in the 1950s was promoted as a way to open up the isolated communities of the Canadian North to new development.  Mostly remembered as a success, the idea was that the federal government would spend hundreds of millions of dollars in road construction that no individual company wanting to exploit resources in the region could afford.  The idea of government spending to open up new territory is hardly new. It was the British government that funded voyages of discovery such as the Franklin expedition, though that didn't quite pay off. The Spanish government of Queen Isabella sponsored exploration by Christopher Columbus.  And that idea of government investment has expanded from new geography to new frontiers in technology. As economist Mariana Mazzucato, author of The Entrepreneurial State: Debunking Public vs. Private Sector Myths, has pointed out, it was massive government investment in unproven technology that created the even more massive private sector wealth of companies like Google and Amazon.    Liberals may scoff at Poilievre's comparison of government spending to running up the credit card. After all, when governments spend money on something like northern roads or other infrastructure projects, the money flows straight back into the economy as wages and business profits that are taxed once again. But the comparison of personal debt and public debt is not baseless.  Running up a credit card bill for consumer goods is different from borrowing to invest in a home. In the same way boosting the deficit to offer juicy election handouts to voters is completely different from deficit spending for long-term investments in the economy. Promises from both frontrunners in this election fall on both sides of that equation.    Last month a group of economists, including French scholar Thomas Piketty, wrote a letter to the Financial Times declaring the advantages of European government investment in the economy, especially when interest rates are so low.  ""Today the government can borrow at negative real interest rates: Many pressing infrastructure, education and environment projects offer returns well above zero and can therefore generate higher future tax receipts, supporting, not detracting, from fiscal sustainability,"" said the letter writers that also included Mazzucato.  The theory behind licence to spend  Mazzucato is one of those who have thrown her support behind that ultimate licence for governments to spend. In Modern Monetary Theory, the idea is that while inflation and interest rates remain low, governments should keep spending until every person is employed and inflation starts to rise. That theory is widely disputed.    Of course the public acceptance of government spending depends on the political times. When Ontario Premier Doug Ford warned of the province drowning in debt, he was playing on memories of older voters of when the federal debt-to-GDP ratio some claimed was as high as 72 per cent, though sources differ on that figure.  With considerable pain to the country, Liberal Finance Minister Paul Martin got the debt down, and since then governments have managed to hold deficit increases below the growth of the economy, something the Liberals are promising to continue. Of course a sudden plunge in economic growth could abruptly change the picture.  But in the wake of the Ford government's cuts in Ontario that many critics claim unnecessarily slashed investment in education, damaging the province's future prospects, the voters' attitude to deficit spending may be blowing the other way.  At least that's what Trudeau is betting for now.  Follow Don on Twitter @don_pittis  ",business
389,Parents whose daughter died by suicide call for compassion,"A Quispamsis man who buried his 21-year-old daughter this month after she succumbed to injuries suffered in a suicide attempt, says he's been spending his haunted, sleepless nights working out his grief in Facebook posts that he wants shared as widely as possible.  ""Depression is a boogeyman and you never know when it will strike,"" Mike Murphy said in an interview about his daughter Maddy.  ""We thought she was doing well, and then all of a sudden, just like that.""  Mike and his wife, Mindy, say their family's story is not a cautionary tale about missed warning signs or a lack of resources.  It's a call for kindness and compassion for those who struggle with mental illness and the burdens they carry.  Those who hurt the most, they say, may be the ones you least suspect.  Share this post  Mike says he's been pouring out his feelings, often in the wee hours when he cannot sleep, tormented by the sudden and unexplained loss of his daughter, who did not leave a note.  His most detailed Facebook post is called ""Maddy's story."" It's a portrait of his daughter and her struggle with depression.  Already shared at least 5,000 times, the Murphys hope it will be shared even more and that is why they agreed to an interview request from CBC News.    They want people to talk about mental illness, even though it may be difficult and confusing, and even though there are no easy answers.  ""I remember thinking to myself, I can't understand this,"" said Mindy, recalling the days when her daughter was in high school.  ""Maddy has such a great life. She goes to a great school. She's got so many friends.""  ""I couldn't understand what was making her depressed, but I've learned along the way, that's not how it is.""  Maddy at 14  From an early age, Maddy showed great promise as an athlete.  She played with boys on the Kennebecasis Valley Minor Hockey Association's Pee Wee AAA Rangers team and would later play for Rothesay Netherwood, an elite private school outside Saint John.  At the age of 15, one of her highlights was to play on the U-18 Team Atlantic in Calgary for the Canadian Women's Nationals.    But at age 14, and seemingly overnight, Maddy developed symptoms of Tourette syndrome.  ""She woke up and she just wasn't right,"" Mike said. ""She was displaying tics and stuttering and couldn't talk.""  He says his daughter felt ashamed and around this time, she started retreating from her parents and her sister and even her twin brother, to hole up in her room.  ""We were walking on eggshells for quite a few years,"" Mike said.  ""We knew that one wrong move would set her off and she would go into that deep, dark hole.""  2 previous attempts   The Murphys remember another turbulent time when Maddy was in Grade 11 and afraid of what would happen if she came out as a lesbian.    ""She was coming out of the closet, and she didn't know how she was going to be accepted on that,"" said Mike.  ""I don't think she was worried about what we'd have to say. I mean, holy cow, nowadays, who cares? We love her unconditionally no matter what.   ""I think it was about all her peers, and she kept that inside.""  Around this time, Maddy tried to commit suicide twice, in a short period, the Murphys say.  They responded by providing her with as much help as they could muster.  Maddy went to doctors and psychologists and had almost unlimited access to private counselling.  If she wanted to go four or five times a week, the Murphys made it happen.  They say Maddy was also on medication that seemed to work for her and with few side-effects.  They also say she became very self-aware and wasn't afraid to ask for help when she felt her mood slipping.      We couldn't have done any more. We couldn't have tried any more.  - Mindy Murphy, mother     ""She didn't have to call me to ask for an appointment,"" said Mindy. ""She was mature enough, and she knew.  ""For us, I have peace knowing that we couldn't have done any more. We couldn't have tried any more.""  ""And that's what worries me, because if you asked what more we could have done, I don't know what could have changed this.""  'Thought she was doing really good'  After high school, Maddy took two years of an arts degree at the University of New Brunswick in Saint John and then decided to take a year off to figure out her future.  She had found a loving partner, and she and her girlfriend had moved into an apartment together.    Maddy had bought herself a little car and had paid a deposit on a golden retriever that would have been her emotional support animal. Although the dog was not yet born, she had named him Beckett.  She was working four jobs, at Rockwood Golf Course, Vito's Restaurant, the Saint John Marina and Harbour Station.  She seemed happy, says Mike, and her Tourette's tics had almost entirely subsided.  Mindy says she still talked to her daughter almost every day.  ""Mindy and I thought she was doing really good there,"" said Mike. ""She seemed really happy. She was starting to get established in life.""  Mike says that's why Maddy's decision to take her own life has shaken them to the core. They say they had no warning.  ""This caught us totally off guard, and I'm still dealing with that today. And I'll be dealing with that for quite some time.""  Learning more about Maddy  The Murphys say they're grateful to the first responders who kept Maddy alive Sept. 12 until she got to the Saint John Regional Hospital, as well as the medical staff who tended to her there.    They say they got four extra days to spend with their daughter, and speak to her, even though she could not respond and may not have heard.  ""We had those extra days to hold her, to hug her,"" said Mike.  They also say it gave people a chance to say goodbye, and the Murphys were astonished by how many visitors came through the hospital room.  They were also surprised at how many people opened up about their own emotional struggles and histories with mental illness and how their daughter Maddy had been there for them.  The Murphys say this continued at the funeral home, where hundreds of people came to pay their respects.  ""We were there for eight hours straight,"" said Mike.  ""That was the outpouring of support we had for this kid. That's how many people she touched.""  'Not one person would know'  The Murphys say they will go to counselling as soon as they're ready.  They say their priority now is to get supports in place for Maddy's sister and twin brother, who will also get counselling.  They've been driving Maddy's car, lately. It makes them feel close to her.  They've also kept her phone. Sometimes, they look at videos that Maddy made with her friends.  ""If you were to pick out the happiest kid in those videos, she would be the happiest,"" said Mindy.  One recent evening, the Murphys went out for dinner, and it made them think how one never knows what another person is dealing with, or going through.  ""Like all those people in the restaurant and not one person would know that we have just buried our daughter,"" said Mindy.  ""You just can't judge anybody, and you just have to be kind.""

390,Health Canada investigating ads for natural health product targeting anxious teens,"A new natural health product aimed at teens may be marketing itself as a treatment for anxiety, counter to Health Canada guidelines.   The federal department is investigating the advertising for Veeva Teen, an herbal supplement it approved for sale in April to treat ""nervousness andu002For restlessness."" Under Health Canada rules the product cannot be marketed as a treatment for anxiety.  Veeva Teen's promotional materials claim it is the first product of its kind for teens that's licensed by Health Canada ""for the relief of nervousness and agitation due to mental stress … all without any scary side-effects.""  The product's website had said, ""Veeva Teen has been professionally formulated as a powerful blend of botanicals, minerals and vitamins to help teens suffering from anxiety."" The word ""anxiety"" was removed some time after 6 ET on Friday, and one day after CBC News spoke with Veeva's founder.  Mental health advocate Erin Kendal, 16, is concerned about the way the product is being marketed and fears teens could find it confusing.  ""If Health Canada is saying that they can't say it's an anxiety medication, they need to say it in big [letters] that this is not an anxiety medication — otherwise, you're going to assume that it is,"" said Kendal, who works with Jack.org, a nation-wide youth group that works to tackle the stigma around mental health issues.    In an email to CBC News, Health Canada said it ""approved specific claims for this product, including 'to help relieve nervousness andu002For restlessness' but not to help relieve anxiety.""  It said it is looking into Veeva Teen and will ask the company to take corrective action if it finds any non-compliance.  'I think it's confusing'  The founder of B.C.-based Veeva Inc., Alain Roy, said the language on the bottle was approved by Health Canada and that he will follow any recommendations made by the agency.  ""What's on the label is a copyu002Fpaste job of what's on the licence,"" Roy said from a natural health store and pharmacy in Vancouver.  But Roy acknowledges some news releases for the product specifically mention anxiety studies. He says he thinks the public will be able to make the distinction.    ""'Nervousness' is a term that should be clear to a lot of people, I think, and 'restlessness' and 'agitation' and 'mental stress.' I think people know what these words mean,"" said Roy. ""Will they think that therefore it's a product for anxiety? I don't know, but that's not what it's for.""   Clinical psychologist Dr. Melanie Badali, of Vancouver, isn't so sure.  ""I think it's confusing,"" Badali said. ""This is what I do: I'm a clinician. I do research. And I'll say I'm nervous when I'm anxious — I will often use those terms interchangeably.""  'We're not licensed doctors'  Kendal thinks most teens won't be able to distinguish between anxiety and the symptoms Veeva Teen says it can help.  ""What I don't love is that it does seem to be promoted as almost like a magic drug fix,"" Kendal said.   ""Their website, you know, it's bright, it's colourful, it's 'Hey! This is going to help you. This is gonna make you feel better.' But I personally don't like the way that it's advertised.""  WATCH: Erin Kendal says there isn't enough information about Veeva Teen    Kendal has been on prescription medication since she was 13 and says she worries that there haven't been any clinical trials to support Veeva Teen's claims — something Health Canada does not require for natural health products.  Kendal is also concerned there isn't enough information about the scientific basis for the product's claims, or about how it may interact with other medications.   Roy said he doesn't have any data on how Veeva Teen might interact with other medications.  ""When people ask us those questions, we tell them that they have to check with their health care professional,"" he said. ""We're not licensed therapists or licensed doctors.""     Roy has worked in the natural products industry for decades. He says was inspired to create natural products specifically for mental health after his mother's suicide in 2012.   His company sells 10 other natural health products that Health Canada has licensed to help with a range of issues, like improving sleep or lowering stress.   Veeva launched the product aimed at teens in late August to coincide with the start of the school year.     Roy said Veeva Teen's claims are based on Health Canada's publicly accessible online  ""monographs"" for ingredients, which outline information on risks and directions of use.  ""We developed it with the science that Health Canada gives us,"" Roy said.  The company's adult supplement is permitted to say it helps with anxiety because it has a different formula.  Regulation of natural health products 'faulty'  The ingredients in Veeva Teen may be on Health Canada's approved list, but the bigger issue is the agency's approach to regulating natural health products, says Tim Caulfield, research director at the University of Alberta's Health Law Institute.   ""I don't think that people should take comfort in the fact that Health Canada is merely looking into this, because the entire regulatory regime is faulty,"" Caulfield said.  ""Just because it's an herb doesn't necessarily mean it's safe and effective,"" he said. ""This is the naturalistic fallacy that is so often associated with these kinds of products.""    Caulfield worries about the message a natural supplement in pill form is sending to nervous teens.  ""I kind of have a problem with the general marketing approach because they're basically saying we should medicate our kids,"" he said.  Roy says his product is not meant as a teen stress cure-all but is intended to help supplement other activities.    ""We would hope that teens resort to other lifestyle strategies first to deal with their nervousness or restlessness, mental stress,"" Roy said.  Badali says anxiety may not necessarily be a bad thing for teens.  ""I don't know that we need to try to relieve anxiety if it's not causing any problems,"" says Badali, who specializes in treating anxiety and depression and is a director of Anxiety Canada.  She says it is important for teens to learn to live with a certain amount of stress and develop coping mechanisms that don't require pills.  Kendal says she likes to try a variety of activities to cope with stress, and natural supplements isn't one of them — at least for now.  ""I feel like it could be a great idea and it could be very helpful. But, again, it's not quite there yet,"" Kendal said.

391,Scheer promises Tories would improve access to disability tax credit,"Andrew Scheer continued applying his campaign strategy of offering tax breaks to specific groups of Canadians on Monday by promising a Conservative government would make it easier for thousands of people to get a federal disability tax credit.  ""If a loved one lives with a disability, a chronic illness or a life-limiting condition, it takes a toll on the entire family, both emotionally and financially,"" he said during an event at a support centre for disabled Canadians in an eastern suburb of Toronto.  ""We need to do more to support Canadians with disabilities in ways that leave more money in their pockets to help them manage their health needs.""  The pledge follows the Conservative leader's earlier election-campaign commitments to re-introduce tax credits for transit users and families with kids in sports and arts programs, among others.  It also comes two years after health groups joined forces with the Tories in accusing the Liberal government of trying to raise tax revenue on the backs of diabetics.    The accusation stemmed from a change at the Canada Revenue Agency that saw Type 1 diabetics being rejected for the tax credit even though they had previously qualified, prompting anger and concern from Diabetes Canada, the Canadian Medical Association and others.  The Canada Revenue Agency later said it would reverse course and process applications under the previous regime.  Scheer nonetheless accused the Liberals Monday of not doing enough to help diabetics and others coping with disabilities, saying a Conservative government would reduce the number of hours per week that must be spent on managing a disability to qualify for the tax credit.  Platform coming before Oct. 11  Canadians must currently spend 14 hours a week on ""life-sustaining therapy"" to qualify for the credit and pay less income tax, and Scheer said the Tories would reduce that to 10 hours per week.  The Conservative leader is also promising to expand the types of activities that count towards those hours, including the addition of exercise and the time taken to determine medical food and formula dosages.  The Tories predict the changes will result in about 35,000 more Canadians being eligible for the tax credit, with average savings of $2,100 per year. The parliamentary budget office says it would cost the government $40 million starting in 2020-21 and $71 million by 2028-29.  Scheer said the Conservatives will release their full platform before the start of advance polling days, which kick off Oct. 11. The Liberals unveiled their platform on Sunday, while the NDP released its document back in June.  Scheer made Monday's announcement in the riding once held by the late Jim Flaherty, who was federal finance minister under Stephen Harper. Flaherty was a passionate advocate along with his wife, current Ontario Health Minister Christine Elliott, for the disability community.  Flaherty and Elliott were instrumental in helping build the Abilities Centre, where Scheer made Monday's announcement.

392,'You have given us the greatest gift': B.C. doctor thanked for life-saving cancer research,"Something Good is a series on CBC's The Early Edition that tells stories to help restore your faith in humanity.  Medical professionals don't always get to hear from the people whose lives they have changed, but one Alberta mother finally had the chance to thank the Vancouver-based doctor whose research helped save the life of her young son.   Kayley Leeds's son, Ashton, was five when he was diagnosed with Stage 4 thyroid cancer in 2014.   This past week, Leeds spoke with Dr. Poul Sorensen of the B.C. Cancer Research Centre for the first time, when she phoned in to CBC's The Early Edition.   ""You have given us the greatest gift,"" Leeds said to Sorensen, who was live in studio with host Stephen Quinn.   ""Every new day that we get to spend together as a family, making more memories, it's because of you and your research.""    Bleak prognosis  When Ashton was first diagnosed, the cancer had spread to his lymph nodes, chest and throughout his lungs.  ""We were just shocked,"" said Kayley Leeds. ""We couldn't believe it because he looked so good. There were no warning signs other than the lump in his neck.""  After extensive surgery and radioactive iodine treatments in Toronto, the cancer continued to spread and was no longer responding to treatment.  The prognosis was bleak, but in 2017 the Leeds received a phone call that eventually changed the course of Ashton's cancer.      A researcher from the Kids Cancer Sequencing (KiCS) program in Toronto phoned to tell them they were starting a genetic database for rare pediatric cancers.  A couple of months later, Ashton's doctor in Calgary called to say the Toronto researchers had identified his cancer — it was a rare genomic fusion Sorenson had discovered at the B.C. Cancer Research Centre, and there was a drug trial for a new treatment.  Sorenson's work helped create the first-of-its-kind treatment, which was recently approved by Health Canada.  He calls the drug, which was created by U.S.-based company Loxo Oncology, ""super effective.""     Leeds says the drug's impact on her son was obvious.  ""The transformation in him was incredible,"" Leeds said. ""He's able to be a normal 10-year-old, running around with his friends.""  A chance to say thanks  Leeds and her family were recently made aware of Sorensen's groundbreaking work, but they have never spoken to him directly.  The family's gratitude was not lost on Sorensen.    ""Believe me, you've made me feel very good and it gives some credence to the idea of studying rare tumours in kids and what it means for the greater society and patients like your son,"" he said.  ""There's something amazing when the work you do actually reaches back and helps patients ... that's so incredibly gratifying.""

393,"If the U.S. loses its measles elimination status, could Canada be next?","This is an excerpt from Second Opinion, a weekly roundup of eclectic and under-the-radar health and medical science news emailed to subscribers every Saturday morning. If you haven't subscribed yet, you can do that by clicking here.    The U.S. could lose its measles elimination status for the first time in almost 20 years this week, and experts say declining vaccination rates and the threat of outbreaks may put Canada at similar risk in the future.  ""Honestly, I'm astonished. I never thought it could happen,"" says Dr. Natasha Crowcroft, director of the Centre for Vaccine Preventable Diseases at the University of Toronto.   ""I think if the U.S. can lose its status, then any country in the world can.""  Measles was officially declared ""eliminated"" in the U.S. in 2000, meaning the disease is no longer ""constantly present"" in the country. But there have been 1,241 cases in 31 states this year to date — the greatest number reported since 1992.    Most of those cases are tied to New York, where 654 people — mostly concentrated in the city's Orthodox Jewish communities in Brooklyn and nearby Rockland County — were diagnosed with measles since the outbreak began on Oct. 1, 2018.  New York City declared its outbreak over on Sept. 3 and Rockland County's ended on Sept. 25. If one more case occurs before Wednesday, the U.S. will join countries such as the United Kingdom and Greece in losing its measles elimination status.   ""The United States and the United Kingdom have beautifully illustrated for us how exactly we can get to that point,"" says Dr. David Fisman, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Toronto's Dalla Lana School of Public Health.  ""And it's by being soft on immunization and telling people that they can do whatever they want.""  Is Canada at risk?   There are currently no active reported cases of measles in Canada, but there have been 111 cases reported this year.  B.C. saw an outbreak of measles in February with at least 19 confirmed cases, in addition to a 2014 outbreak in the Fraser Valley that saw hundreds of cases across the province.   Quebec has seen outbreaks as well, with more than 750 confirmed cases in a 2011 outbreak and 119 confirmed cases reported in 2015 in the province's Lanaudière region that were tied to a Disneyland outbreak in California.    The Public Health Agency of Canada says this country will continue to see cases of measles related to travel, because of the circulation of the disease in many parts of the world. The last reported case here was in early September.   ""Unfortunately, there's no real reason to think this same thing could not happen here,"" says Dr. Joan Robinson, a pediatric infectious diseases physician at the University of Alberta.  ""Our measles immunization rates are roughly similar to those in the U.S. and measles is a highly contagious virus.""  The latest national information on child immunization coverage shows that 90 per cent of two-year-old children in Canada have received at least one dose of the measles vaccine.  Experts say a 95 per cent vaccination rate for measles is ideally needed for ""herd immunity"" in the population to prevent outbreaks.      ""Once you introduce measles into any of those [communities], it just takes off and it just keeps going and going and going,"" says Dr. Noni MacDonald, professor of pediatrics at Dalhousie University and a specialist in pediatric infectious diseases.  ""It's very worrisome. We've just not been blessed at the present time with a huge outbreak. But we don't have 95 per cent uptake uniformly across our country.""  'Vaccine hesitancy'  One proposed solution to the risk of outbreaks is to end the exemption of vaccinations for non-medical reasons.  Toronto's medical officer of health, Dr. Eileen de Villa, made that very recommmendation at a board of health meeting earlier this week to combat ""vaccine hesitancy."" She was met with dozens of angry protesters.     The World Health Organization has identified vaccine hesitancy as one of its 10 threats to global health in 2019, defining it as ""the reluctance or refusal to vaccinate despite the availability of vaccines.""   Robinson says forcing parents to vaccinate their children may not be effective in combatting the growing anti-vaccination movement.      ""Parents who are somewhat vaccine hesitant but normally would still immunize their children might get so angry about this issue that they then decide that they're actually at least not going to immunize them until they're old enough to go to school,"" Robinson said.  ""I think it could actually all backfire.""  Fighting misinformation  Jill Promoli's two-year-old son Jude died from a strain of influenza in May 2016 despite having had the flu shot months earlier.   Since then, the Mississauga, Ont. mother has faced hundreds of attacks from anti-vaccination groups on social media for her own advocacy efforts on the importance of immunizations through her organization ""For Jude, For Everyone.""    ""The things that we were hearing in that meeting on Monday are the things that were constantly in my inbox, showing up on Twitter and anything I post on Facebook,"" Promoli said.   ""It was a little bit jarring on Monday to be at that meeting because even though I'm used to reading these things online, in the real world when I'm walking around, most people, the vast majority of people, understand that vaccination is safe.""     Dr. Sohail Gandhi, president of the Ontario Medical Association, believes there should be a nationwide policy against non-medical exemptions. He says the majority of those concerned about vaccines are misinformed parents trying to protect their children.  ""Unfortunately, sometimes, when you're reaching for an answer and there isn't one, you reach for the wrong answer and that's a huge, huge challenge for us, as physicians, to deal with this. How do you educate in a situation like that?"" he said.   ""We all need to do a better job of reaching out to those people, and we also need to do it with with some sympathy and a little bit of compassion.""

394,How Greta Thunberg's autism helps give her a singular focus,"Greta Thunberg has met with world leaders, had an audience with the pope and made an impassioned plea to the United Nations. She's done it all in the public eye, facing down trolls and sounding off against politicians, an impressive feat for any teenager.  The 16-year-old has reached millions with her message about the need for urgent action on climate change. She's also inspired people with her public acknowledgement that she's on the autism spectrum.   She calls her autism her ""superpower."" She has a clear message: she succeeds not in spite of her disability, but because of it.  It's a voice that's refreshing for Anne Borden King and her son Baxter, 9, who are both autistic. They travelled from Toronto to Montreal on Friday to march in the country's largest climate strike.   Empowering for others on the spectrum  The way Thunberg frames her diagnosis as an advantage instead of an obstacle is empowering, says Anne Borden King.  ""I think that a lot of the time that we look at how autism is portrayed, it's often portrayed as kind of a burden. As a sadness. And autistic people are often made to be very sort of two-dimensional in media,"" she says. ""And to see someone that big and outright in the media and really a three-dimensional person is incredible.""  Watch: Greta Thunberg explains how autism helps her environmental mission    Thunberg tags Instagram posts #aspiepower and writes that ""being different is not an illness and the current, best available, science is not opinions — it's facts.""  ""For those of us who are on the spectrum, almost everything is black or white,"" she said at a TEDx Talk in Stockholm in November 2018.   To Thunberg, climate change is a black and white issue: It's bad and it needs to be stopped now.  It's that outlook, the singular focus, that makes Greta's message so powerful, says Steve Silberman, a science writer and author of the book NeuroTribes: The Legacy of Autism and the Future of Neurodiversity.  Willingness to speak 'blunt truth'  Thunberg's effectiveness is not about a girl succeeding despite the obstacle of being different, says Silberman.  ""I feel like in this case her inability to abide hypocrisy and her willingness to speak the blunt truth and say 'I don't care about being popular' was her using her autism in the best possible way to save the planet.""    People with autism are often literal thinkers and it's the simplicity and purity of Thunberg's message that is resonating so widely, because it doesn't waver. That appeals to everyone, especially younger people who tend to see the world in less nuanced ways.  But it doesn't mean it is easy. There are aspects of being on the spectrum that might mean extra challenges for the teenage climate activist, Borden King says.  ""I mean travelling across the ocean for two weeks on a speeding boat, landing in New York City and just hitting the ground running, it's a lot for anyone,"" she says. ""But then when you add in that there will be sensory issues and then it takes more work, that's an extra amount of energy that she needs to put into it.""    People with autism can be extremely sensitive to sensory overload. Noise and being around big groups of people can be especially difficult for people on the spectrum, due to neurological differences in the autistic brain.  Many crave routine and quiet, and are most comfortable when they know what is going to happen next, says Silberman.  Autism is a spectrum, so there are a wide range of ways people with autism see and react to things.  Silberman points out ""any statement about all autistic people is apt to be wrong and there are going to be exceptions.""  But he says it's a very consistent trait that ""autistic people are almost viscerally bothered by hypocrisy and lies.""  Critics feed on her difference  Being public about being on the spectrum has also meant additional fuel for those who disagree with her message — everyone from online trolls to high profile politicians, including the president of the United States Donald Trump and People's Party of Canada leader Maxime Bernier.    The bullying is now relying on ableism, says Silberman. When critics talk about Thunberg's ""robotic voice or wooden affect,"" they are trying to invalidate her message using her disability.    It's something Silberman says he thinks she has overcome by speaking the truth in the most simple of terms.  ""Greta's consistency, her reliance on the science, her rationality, her stunning maturity. I mean she looks like an adult compared to the people who were attacking her, who look like children, basically,"" he says.    For Baxter King, age nine, Thunberg is a role model because of her message, but also because they have much in common.  ""She's autistic and I'm autistic so we're sort of, almost, kind of, related to each other.""  ""I've never heard of anyone being autistic who's famous,"" he says.  ""Yeah, it's pretty cool.""

396,Quebec resident confirmed as first Canadian case of vaping-related illness ,"A Quebec resident has been diagnosed with Canada's first case of a severe vaping-related breathing illness, federal officials have confirmed.  ""In this case, it does meet the criteria, and yes it is considered the first vaping-related illness [in Canada] related to what's happening in the States,"" said Maryse Durette, senior media relations adviser for Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada.  The patient, a person in their 50s who lives in Montreal, was recently admitted to hospital with breathing problems.  The person had been vaping for a few months as a way to quit smoking, said Dr. Mylène Drouin, director of public health for the Montreal region.  Drouin said the product the person was using is legally sold in Canada and contained only nicotine, but would not give any other details.  In Canada, the definition of a vaping-related severe pulmonary illness case includes the following criteria:     Symptoms such as shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, with or without vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever.   History of vaping or dabbing (using THC concentrates like oil or wax) 90 days prior to symptom onset.   Pulmonary infiltrate, which is a substance denser than air, such as pus, blood, or protein in the lungs.   Negative results on tests for a lung infection.   No evidence in medical records of alternative plausible diagnoses.    Anyone who has used an e-cigarette or vaping products, and has experienced these symptoms is advised to consult a health-care professional.  Last week, officials in Ontario reported a teenager was put on life-support after using a vaping device. However, that case has not yet been confirmed under the federal definition.   Durette said federal officials are aware of a handful of other events across the country and right now, they are considered as ""incidents under investigation.""   In the U.S., there have been more than 800 cases and 13 deaths.    Drouin said people who switched to vaping to cut down on smoking cigarettes should not go back to cigarettes. But she also raised concerns about the risks of vaping.  ""The message to the population, and to clinicians, is that there are other products, smoking cessation programs, and products that are already approved and safe ... and those products should be the first choice for those who want to quit smoking,"" she said.  'Vaping is not without risk'  Two weeks ago, Quebec's Health Ministry issued a warning about the risks of developing a pulmonary illness as a result of vaping.  Dr. Horacio Arruda, provincial director of public health, said what they know is there is a link between the illness and people who vape.    But because there are different models of e-cigarettes, and different vaping products, it is unclear whether the issue is with a specific company or product.  They stress that anyone who doesn't already smoke or who has never used an e-cigarette shouldn't start now.  ""Vaping is not without risk, and its long-term effects aren't yet known,"" Arruda said.     Daniel Marien, spokesperson for the Vaping Industry Trade Association (VITA), said he welcomes the investigation into the illness.  ""I want the public to know what the problem is with that specific person, and any case that [is] related to vaping, they have to dig in to see what the cause of it is,"" he said.  He said his message to the federal government is that it should keep looking into the illness, but should not ""take drastic actions based on assumptions.""  A group of Canadian health organizations recently called on the federal parties to regulate the e-cigarette and vaping industry.",health
397,Doctors group calls on federal election candidates to put health care back on the agenda,"The president-elect of the Canadian Medical Association was in Moncton on Friday as part of a cross-country tour to meet with federal election candidates about getting health care on the election agenda.  Dr. Ann Collins, who has a family practice in Fredericton, says provinces and territories are digging themselves deeper in debt trying to keep up with health-care costs.  And it's only expected to get worse as the population ages, unless the federal government steps up funding to address the so-called silver tsunami.  ""Like anything, it will take a commitment,"" said Collins. ""It'll take these parties the realization that this is … not an in-the-future [problem], it's here now, it's affecting the health of Canadians.""  The association contends a top-up to the Canada Health Transfer to provide extra funding to provinces and territories, based on their population of seniors, could help.  It's one of several proposals developed by the association, which represents about 85,000 physicians, residents and medical students across the country.      It affects all of us. We're all potentially patients.  - Ann Collins, president-elect of Canadian Medical Association     ""What we've heard from Canadians — and we've listened intently to Canadians over the last year — is that our health-care system is failing them,"" Collins said. ""It's an antiquated system, if you will, and not meeting their needs.  ""So we have put together a policy platform to help put forward proposals to the … federal election candidates on the issues that matter to our patients, to Canadians.""  The association would also like to see a seniors care benefit, to help cover additional out-of-pocket expenses for seniors and their caregivers who currently spend more than $9 billion to care for their loved ones.  ""Many of the caregivers to our seniors are seniors themselves and are beginning to struggle with what comes along sometimes with aging, so we need to support them,"" said Collins.  Other ideas include:      A $1.2 billion primary health-care transition fund to support the medical home model to improve access to primary care.     Support for a pan-Canadian medical licensing system, to expand virtual care and deliver health care to people in remote areas.     Without changes, Canadians face health care cuts and reduced quality of care, said Collins.  ""It affects all of us. We're all potentially patients and so we want to have … the best system that we can to care for us and for our kids going forward.""",health
398,U.S. CDC recommends against using vapes with marijuana ingredient,"People should stop using e-cigarettes with the marijuana ingredient tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), U.S. public health officials recommended on Friday as investigation on outbreak of lung illness linked to vaping deepens.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has previously warned on vaping, but its latest recommendation focused on THC products following U.S. data that pointed to a large number of cases related to the use of the high-inducing component of marijuana.    The CDC and state health officials, along with other health agencies, are investigating 805 confirmed and probable cases and 13 deaths so far from a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, as of the latest update on Thursday.  For the 771 people with basic patient data, 91 per cent were hospitalized. Many need supplemental oxygen and treatment in intensive care units. Most recovered and went home.   ""We do not know yet what exactly is making people sick, for example, whether particular solvents or adulterants are leading to lung injury, or whether cases stem from a single supplier or multiple ones,"" Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the CDC, told reporters.    Separate data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled-THC cartridge called ""Dank Vapes.""  In Canada, a Quebec resident has been diagnosed as the country's first case of a severe vaping-related breathing illness, federal officials confirmed on Friday.  Last week, officials in Ontario reported a teenager was put on a ventilator after using a vaping device. However, that case has not been confirmed under the federal definition.    ",health
399,What MIT Media Lab's funding scandal says about sexism in tech,"How does a renowned educational institution dubbed ""the Future Factory"" reconcile its role as both an influential pipeline to the tech industry and a school whose leadership aligned itself with a known sexual predator?  It's a question that staff and students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are grappling with, after multiple reports revealed that the MIT Media Lab accepted — and covered up — millions of dollars in donations from billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted criminal who served time for procuring the services of an underage girl for prostitution. Epstein was found dead in his jail cell in August after an apparent suicide while awaiting trial on new sex charges.  But while the Media Lab is at the centre of the scandal, experts point out, the issues at the core of the controversy are prevalent across the tech industry.  According to a 2018 report from the U.S. National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine, women in STEM fields in that country endure the highest rate of sexual harassment of any profession outside the military. And the policies meant to combat the problem protect institutions, not victims, the report said.  When it comes to systemic sexism, ""It's well known that the problems are everywhere,"" said Imogen Coe, a professor in the Faculty of Science at Ryerson University in Toronto. ""And the more there is at stake — particularly in terms of money flowing in support of research and development, and prestige — the more there is to hide and cover up.""     Even though Epstein was listed as ""disqualified"" in MIT's official donor database, the Media Lab continued to accept gifts from him, marking his contributions as anonymous so as to avoid disclosing their full extent. If faculty members expressed disapproval of the transactions and the school's relationship with the sex offender, efforts were made to keep them in the dark.  When the coverup was revealed, some prominent researchers went so far as to sever ties with the lab, out of protest.  In announcing his resignation Ethan Zuckerman, the director of the Center for Civic Media, wrote, ""The work my group does focuses on social justice and on the inclusion of marginalized individuals and points of view. It's hard to do that work with a straight face in a place that violated its own values so clearly in working with Epstein and in disguising that relationship.""    The next prominent individual to resign was Joi Ito, the lab's director and the one directly responsible for accepting Epstein's money.  Though Ito had admitted to having invited Epstein to the lab, to visiting ""several"" of his residences and to accepting money for personal ventures as well as for the school, Ito originally stated that he would stay at the lab to ""begin a process of restorative healing,"" despite calls from the community that he step down.  'International issue'  One of those calls came from Media Lab grad student Arwa Mboya.   ""This is not an MIT issue, and this is not a Joi Ito issue. This is an international issue where a global network of powerful individuals have used their influence to secure their privilege at the expense of women's bodies and lives,"" Mboya wrote in an article in MIT's student newspaper The Tech at the end of August, before an exposé by famed #metoo journalist Ronan Farrow appeared in the New Yorker.  Another prominent researcher, the computer scientist Richard Stallman, was pressured to resign from the school over comments he made that seemed to excuse Epstein's behaviour, such as his statement that ""it is morally absurd to define 'rape' in a way that depends on minor details such as which country it was in or whether the victim was 18 years old or 17."" He stepped down earlier this month.    While Epstein was consulted on how his funds would be used, women were excluded from his events. According to reports, Epstein would hold ""billionaire dinners"" and invite the star researchers and faculty from the school — or rather, the male star researchers and faculty.  Sarah Szalavitz, a social designer and external fellow at the MIT Media Lab, said in the New York Times, ""It's not a grand conspiracy. It's just a fact: When you have an event on a private beach owned by a sex trafficker, women don't get invited. They don't get invited to the private island. They don't get invited to the sex trafficker's conferences. They don't get invited to speak.""  Not a 'pipeline problem'  The funding scandal puts the lie to all of the industry's initiatives to bring more diversity into the stream of STEM fields — what's known as the ""pipeline."" Simply filling the ranks with more women is misguided, Coe said, because it still puts the onus on women to ""break into"" the field as opposed to putting pressure on the establishment to be more welcoming.    ""By claiming it's a pipeline problem, the responsibility for who has to do the work gets shifted away from those who are actually creating the culture,"" Coe said.    And as the controversy showed, women are still at a disadvantage.  ""Those with power and privilege absolve themselves"" of responsibility for their own role in sustaining the sexist culture.  ""More needs to be done,"" said Canadian aerospace engineer Natalie Panek. She said she is often asked what advice she would give to women who are deterred from STEM.  ""This question needs to be reframed as: How can we dismantle the systemic barriers that drive women out of STEM?""  The onus is not on women, she said, but on the institutions and people in positions of power ""to make STEM environments more inclusive, and to ensure there is transparency in processes and decision-making.""    As for how the Media Lab reconciles its role in shaping the future, Myoba wrote, ""We must set an example of leadership that is truly ethical, inclusive, equitable and focused on creating a standard that puts human rights at the centre.""  There is an important lesson for Canadian universities in all of this, too, said Coe.  ""Chasing money and prestige at any cost means exactly that — at a cost,"" she said, ""and that cost can be people's lives."" ",technology
400,SpaceX's Elon Musk plans to launch this Mars rocketship within months,"Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has unveiled the latest iteration of his space company's newly assembled Starship, outlining a speedy development timeline for the centerpiece vehicle of SpaceX's quest to launch humans to the moon and Mars.  Musk showed a crowd of space enthusiasts and reporters at SpaceX's rocket development site late on Saturday in the remote village of Boca Chica, Texas, animations of Starship landing on the moon and Mars and predicted that the rocket's first orbital flight could come in the next six months, followed by missions to space with humans aboard the next year.  ""This is basically the holy grail of space,"" Musk said, standing between a towering, newly assembled Starship rocket and Falcon 1 — the company's first vehicle whose debut orbital mission was celebrated by SpaceX 11 years ago.  ""The critical breakthrough that's needed for us to become a space-faring civilization is to make space travel like air travel,"" said Musk, who is also the chief executive of electric carmaker Tesla Inc.    Starship, a shiny steel rocketship designed to ferry dozens of humans to the moon and Mars, is the top half of Musk's colossal interplanetary rocket system that stands 118 metres (387 feet tall) as the latest addition to SpaceX's lineup of reusable launch vehicles. Musk named Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa as Starship's first private passenger in 2018.  The Boca Chica village, a few miles north of the Mexican border, is ground zero for SpaceX's three-year experimental test program for Starship, whose rocket engine tests have rattled the nerves of residents living in a remote hamlet of roughly two dozen homes a mile away.    ""I think the actual danger to the Boca Chica village is low but it's not tiny,"" Musk said during a question and answer session. ""So probably over time it'd be better to buy out the villages, and we've made an offer to that effect.""  Some residents have rejected SpaceX's non-negotiable offer to buyout their homes for three times the market value.    A three-legged prototype of the rocket named Starhopper has test launched in the village twice since July, most recently flying as high as 152 metres (500 feet) and landing on an adjacent slab of concrete to trial Musk's next generation rocket engine dubbed Raptor.    Musk's mission to the moon aligns with NASA's goal of sending humans there by 2024 under its Artemis program, an accelerated deep-space initiative spurred by the Trump administration in March that aims to work with a handful of U.S. space companies in building a long-term presence on the lunar surface before eventually colonizing Mars.  The space agency has tapped SpaceX to figure out how to land vehicles on the lunar surface and help develop a system for refuelling rockets — like Starship — in space, an ""important technology to aid sustained exploration efforts on the Moon and Mars,"" NASA said in a release on Friday.    NASA has awarded SpaceX and Boeing Co a total of $6.8 billion US to build competing rocket and capsule systems to launch astronauts into orbit from American soil for the first time since 2011. Development of both astronaut capsules have been beset by delays and testing mishaps.    ""I am looking forward to the SpaceX announcement tomorrow. In the meantime, Commercial Crew is years behind schedule,"" NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine said in a Friday night statement. ""NASA expects to see the same level of enthusiasm focused on the investments of the American taxpayer. It's time to deliver.""",technology
401,Toronto business owner loses $14K to technical glitch at mobile payment company ,"A glitch in the popular Square payment technology is causing financial headaches for some of the company's users, CBC News has learned.  The tech company won't say how widespread the issue is, or how many customers have been affected.  ""I can't say this is widespread. I can't say it's a one-off,"" Valerie Jackson, Square Canada's communications manager, told CBC News.  Square runs a mobile payment system that allows customers to tap or swipe their credit or debit cards to pay for purchases. It's particularly popular with small businesses like coffee shops.   The tech company then transfers the money to a business owner's bank account.  A small business owner in Toronto processed more than $14,000 in sales through Square that never made it into her TD Canada Trust bank account.  'I want them to fix it'  ""I want them to fix it and I want our $14,000,"" said Monica Mustelier, co-owner of the Little Havana mobile coffee stand.  For the past three years, Moustelier used Square without any problems.   But on Aug. 26, she started to notice thousands of dollars in sales revenue weren't being transferred as expected.   ""It's been really frustrating because I've been spending at least two to three hours every day going between Square and TD when I could actually be drumming up business for us,"" Mustelier said.    Fearing more money might go missing, Mustelier says she's stopped using Square and is accepting cash-only payments from the dozens of daily customers who visit her business.  ""I would say at least 80 per cent of our customers use cards — credit cards or debit cards — and we've lost a lot of business because of that,"" she told CBC News.  'Acquiring processor' to blame  After a month of calls to both Square and their bank, the problem was still unresolved, according to Mustelier.  ""Where that money is, is a really great question,"" she said.  Last week, after CBC News reached out to Square, the funds were located.     In an email to Mustelier, Square's customer service department told her, ""Your deposits have been delayed with Square's acquiring processor.""   ""Rest assured, we are continuing to do everything we can to gain additional insight and we are advocating for the fastest possible resolution,"" the email continued.  No further explanation was given. The $14,000 still hasn't been returned to Mustelier.  'We just trust technology'  Professor Ramona Pringle, a tech expert and director of Ryerson University's Transmedia Zone, says the situation is a cautionary tale as business owners and consumers rely heavily on technology.  ""The bigger conversations we're having right now about tech in general these days involve transparency and accountability,"" she said.  ""We need to be able to see inside these black boxes. Right now everything is so proprietary and we just trust the technology, yet sometimes things can go wrong,"" Pringle added.    ""There needs to be answers for the customer. The people creating these tools need to be designing for not just how we disrupt industries, but also how problems can be solved when things go wrong.""  Jackson, Square's communications manager, wouldn't elaborate on what exactly did go wrong.  However, she says Square is working to get Mustelier's money back to her.    ""I can assure you we are doing everything we can to resolve this as quickly as possible. It's not right the money is not with [Mustelier]"" she said  Mustelier says if she gets her money back soon, she'll continue to use the technology.  ""I really like it. But I'm a little tentative,"" she said.",technology
402,'I feel more equal': How technology is making direct communication possible for deaf community,"David Burke waited over 60 years to be able to communicate with the world.   And with the help of a relatively new technology, that wait is over.  Burke is deaf. The 66-year-old Winnipegger said that for most of his life he had very few options when it came to connecting with people.  ""If I was sick I would still have to physically go to work, inform them that I was sick and then return home. If I wanted to go visit a friend I would have to physically go to them and see if they're home, and if they weren't home, I would have to come back,"" Burke said.  But that's all in the past.  Burke now uses the Canada Video Relay Service (VRS) — a national telecommunication service that allows people who are deaf or hard of hearing to make direct phone calls to anyone in North America.  He said it has changed his life forever.  ""I remember my first call. It was so clear. I was so happy and thankful,"" Burke said. ""I feel more equal to the hearing population.""    Burke said deaf people prefer to use their first language — which is usually sign language — instead of their second language because they're more comfortable signing and communicating that way. According to Canada VRS's website, interpreters are available to provide services in four languages: ASL, LSQ, English and French.  He said text and email don't allow for the same freedom of communication. VRS is the closest he's ever come to speaking directly with the hearing community.  ""For me, I have my computer open and there is a video that I see the interpreter who has a headset on in order to communicate [with the person on the phone] and can be hands-free in order to communicate with me. The interpreter can see me signing and I can see them signing and they can hear [the person] speaking and [the person] can hear them speaking.""  VRS was introduced across Canada in 2017. Today it has over 300 certified interpreters and over 7,000 registered users. It's available 24u002F7, year-round. It allows the user to make and receive phone calls, as well as take and leave messages.  Battle for better communication  Diane Underschultz, a community outreach specialist for Canada VRS, said this technology has been widely available in the U.S. for over 25 years but it was a bit of an uphill battle to bring it to Canada.  ""The deaf community tried to advocate with the [Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission] and they were the ones kind of rebelling against it,"" Underschultz said. ""It was all about the money.""  But the community didn't give up.  Underschultz says the Canadian Association of the Deaf spent over a decade in negotiations with the arm's-length  federal telecommunications regulators before finally gaining approval and funding.  Now, the national commission provides funding for private call centres to hire certified interpreters. For the deaf users, the service is completely free. All they need is a device and a connection to the internet.    Underschultz's job is to raise awareness about the service. She says it's not perfect yet and she's hoping more public awareness will help sort out some of the kinks.  ""The interpreter is still technically a third party so there are confidentiality issues at times, like with the bank, for instance. But even so, this is a huge improvement from what existed before,"" Underschultz said.  New ways  Prior to VRS, the only device for this type of communication was the teletypewriter — also known as TTY — which could be connected to a phone line and allowed users to type messages back and forth. In some cases, the messages could be relayed out loud by a digital operator or an interpreter.  But Burke says that really wasn't enough for him.    Now that he has access to this technology he's only looking forward to the future. VRS has opened doors he didn't even know were closed and he's determined to make sure as many people as possible know about it.  ""What people have to understand is the impact. There's communication that wasn't happening before. Now, I can call the bank, I can call family, I can call friends just to chat. It's so much easier to make appointments on my own,"" says Burke.  While he enjoys the independence it's provided, he says VRS has had the biggest impact on his personal relationships. He now spends hours chatting with his friends and family.      ""I feel more equal to the hearing population.""  - David Burke     Not only has it brought him closer to his loved ones, he says they understand him in a whole new way.  ""I get to have these deep connections and really share and tell stories. Because before it was very limited. They didn't understand me so I feel like they didn't really understand my level of intelligence. They kind of underestimated me, whereas now we can have these kinds of conversations and they're like, 'Wow, you're actually really smart,' and I'm like 'Yes, I just use a different language.' My ideas are much more clear using sign language.""    Burke says all of the waiting was worth it and he's going to spend the rest of his life making sure the hearing population knows about VRS.  ""I have been very patient and that's why I'm so excited for the opportunity to make these phone calls and have this service.""",technology
403,Why engineers in Alberta think they've found a way for the oilsands to produce clean fuel,"As the world reaches for cleaner energy, hydrogen has long been viewed with a lot of hope.  Often called the fuel of the future, the gas can be used to generate electricity and power vehicles. It produces water — not carbon — when burned.  But among its challenges is the economics of producing the gas in a large-scale and environmentally friendly way. One of the least expensive methods for doing so, for example, using methane, has drawn scrutiny for its carbon emissions.    Now, engineers in Alberta believe they could have an answer — a method capable of extracting hydrogen from underground resources like oilsands deposits while leaving the carbon emissions it produces below the surface.   The team turned heads with their work this summer at the Goldschmidt Geochemistry Conference in Barcelona, making headlines from Britain to Japan.    Hydrogen can be found in many different organic compounds, including hydrocarbons like oil and gas.  One of the most common ways of producing hydrogen from natural gas is called steam-methane reforming, which uses methane and very hot steam under pressure to create a chemical reaction freeing the hydrogen and capturing it in special filters. The waste emissions are carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide.    ""That's been an industrial technology for over 80 [years],"" said Grant Strem, CEO of Proton Technologies, the private company commercializing the new process for creating hydrogen.  ""What we're doing is very similar, but the big difference is, we're using the ground as a reaction vessel, so our capital cost is a lot lower, and instead of buying natural gas to fuel it, we use the unswept oil in the reservoir as our fuel.""   How the process works  Through lab work and small-scale field testing, the researchers say they found injecting oxygen into the fields raises the temperature and creates a reaction that frees the hydrogen.  ""You can envision that the reservoir is simply a hot, bubbling mix of oil, which some fraction of it is now combusting,"" said professor Ian Gates, from his lab at the University of Calgary's Schulich School of Engineering.   ""And as it is doing so, it simply keeps producing more and more hydrogen as a consequence of its reactions.""  Gates said palladium alloy filters then allow the hydrogen to come to surface while filtering out the other gases, like carbon dioxide or hydrogen sulfide, which stay below ground.  Conceptually, Gates said, the oil in the reservoir could later be produced.  But the expectation is the process can draw up ""huge"" quantities of hydrogen relatively inexpensively.     And Canada would be able to tap its resources.  ""There's a lot of work toward renewables, hydro and all those other things, but you still have a huge amount of assets, chemical energy, stored in oil,"" Gates said.   ""What this is about is how do we make use of oil reservoirs — or even gas reservoirs — and get pure, clean energy out of it.""  Gates said after proving the concept in the field last year, they will soon begin testing to see how it works on a larger scale. A semi-commercial pilot project is in the works for next year.    Proton Technologies is working with an engineering firm to design a scaled-up version of their demonstration facility at its site in Kerrobert, Sask.   Now, the challenge will be to see how the process works in the field with all of the complexities of a reservoir.   ""Does [the hydrogen] really transport as effectively as you predicted in your models, as you've estimated from the lab?"" he said. ""Everything so far is supportive. Yes, we should be able to access it, but we do need to verify that.""    Reservoirs that are open to the surface or very shallow would not likely be good candidates for such a system, he said.  Field testing needed  After the team's work was presented at the Goldschmidt conference in Barcelona last month, some experts responded with cautious optimism, emphasizing the need for extensive field testing of the technology to assess how well it could work on an industrial scale and over time.    In Canada, Warren Mabee, the director of the Queen's Institute for Energy and Environmental Policy, said having a large source of hydrogen that's relatively easy to access would be an important step toward a cleaner energy future.  ""There are some technologies that can use hydrogen really well,"" Mabee told CBC News.  ""It's very, very clean as long as there's not a lot of greenhouse gas associated with producing it, which, in this case, it sounds like there isn't. Which is a wonderful technology, if we've gotten to that point.""    Significant research is being done on developing new ways of producing hydrogen, including microbes and solar technologies, among others.  China, Japan and South Korea have big plans to put millions of hydrogen-powered vehicles on their roads in the coming decade.  Hydrogen has had false starts  Hydrogen was also a key topic of conversation during a July meeting hosted by the International Energy Agency. The Paris-based body, which advises on energy policy to its 30 member states, said hydrogen was enjoying ""unprecedented momentum,"" offering ways to decarbonize a range of sectors, including long-haul transportation.    ""But it has experienced false starts in the past and still faces big challenges to scale up infrastructure and bring down costs,"" the IEA said in a release.  A lack of refueling stations for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles is often pointed to as a major barrier to the technology taking off.  The delivery process for the hydrogen — including pipelines, storage facilities, compressors and trucks — is also a work in progress when it comes to widespread consumer use.  Gates and Strem hope they can do their part to move things forward.  ""I'm very motivated by the idea of taking these [hydrocarbon] resources, which are of incredible value to Canada, and pivoting their use toward hydrogen production and ultra-clean energy outcomes,"" Gates said.  ""In my view, this is something that's quite exciting.""",technology
404,Green party proposes a 'robot tax' when companies replace workers with machines,"The Green party is proposing a ""robot tax.""  Green Leader Elizabeth May says that every time a company replaces a worker with a machine, a Green government would make that company pay a tax equivalent to the income tax paid by that laid-off employee.  May says Canada is fast becoming a world leader in artificial intelligence, but the needs of workers must be at the forefront of policy discussions.  She says the revenue from a ""robot tax"" would be used to fund educational and retraining programs for workers.  May says technology and computer science can be industries that, when using renewable energy, are environmentally friendly.    The Greens also want to see legislation brought in to govern ethical, environmental, social and economic implications of widespread use of AI.  ",technology
405,University of Alberta vice-president resigns over 'beefier barley' billboards,"The University of Alberta's vice-president of university relations has resigned over the school's ""beefier barley"" billboards, which were slammed as promoting climate change.  ""The messaging on the ad called the reputation of the University of Alberta and its extensive research on climate change into question,"" vice-president of university relations Jacqui Tam said in an announcement posted Sunday.  ""As Vice-President (University Relations), I apologize for this and take responsibility. In the best interests of the institution, I am announcing my departure from the University of Alberta, effective immediately.""  The ""beefier barley"" billboards, displayed at four locations in Edmonton and Calgary, read, ""Climate change will boost Alberta's barley yield with less water, feeding more cattle.""  The billboard is part of Truth Matters, a larger advertising campaign from the university, highlighting research ""that tackles today's complex challenges, and to encourage discussion,"" Tam said in an earlier statement posted Thursday after concerns were raised by the public, students and faculty members.   Climate protests  Posts on social media slammed the ad as a pro-climate change billboard from the U of A, also criticizing the timing of the billboards, as thousands of climate activists took to Edmonton's streets to join the Global Climate Strike on Friday.      Young Alberta activists join global climate strikes    The billboard also caused concern among the university's faculty of science about the representation of scientific research.   ""It is unfortunate that the findings of a 2017 peer-reviewed scientific study have been taken out of context with a single statement on a billboard and framed to suggest support for climate change,"" wrote Dean of Science Matina Kalcounis-Rueppell in a statement Friday.  ""There are risks associated with taking scientific results out of context, particularly in an age of science skepticism.""  The university will pull the ad as soon as possible, Tam's statement said.   Different opinions  University of Alberta president David Turpin said normal procedure was not followed in running the ad, which should've been vetted by the school's executive team.  ""I'm pretty sure that would have never seen the light of day,"" Turpin said.  ""I can understand why people interpreted it the way they did,"" Turpin said, adding ""it would not have been an ad that, if I had seen, I would put forward.  ""Jacqui is a person of such incredible integrity and such deep and strongly held values when she realized the implications of that decision she stood up, took full responsibility and tendered her resignation.""     Third-party advertiser disavows 'mass immigration' message on billboards   'Sneaky way to make people feel othered': Sherwood Park resident rips down anti-Muslim sticker    Turpin said he is aware that not everyone will agree with the school's decision to pull the ad, or on researchers seeking out benefits of climate change.  ""One of the things that we have a huge number of people working on, is adaptation,"" Turpin said.  ""Climate change is real, it's happening, and as a society we must adapt and we have some absolutely outstanding scholars doing just that. And that was the research that was being profiled,"" Turpin said.  ""Unfortunately the way in which it was articulated led to some misunderstandings and misinterpretation.""  Turpin could not confirm whether the ads will be replaced with new billboards as part of the campaign, but said the university will be reviewing its procedures.",technology
406,Unapologetic Louis C.K. hits the stage in Toronto for first of 5 sold out nights,"No cellphones, no recording devices, no apologies: comedian Louis C.K. took the stage at Toronto's Yuk Yuk's Comedy Club on Wednesday for the first of five sold out nights, with strict restrictions on audience recordings but few limitations on his repertoire of jokes.  The 52-year-old comedian walked onto the stage in his signature black T-shirt and jeans to uproarious applause from the audience of about 250 people, and immediately tackled the subject of how his life has changed since a sexual misconduct scandal rocked his career.   In November 2017, five women accused the American comedian and actor of sexual misconduct. He quickly released a statement acknowledging the allegations were true. His actions resulted in cancelled TV and streaming deals as well as his new film, I Love You, Daddy, being shelved.   Reflecting on the two years since the scandal broke, he told the mostly male audience they were lucky that that the whole world did not know their secret ""thing"" the way everyone now knows his. ""My thing is: I like to masturbate, and I don't like to be alone.""  Self-deprecating humour was partially what made C.K. a star — and that was apparent in Wednesday's performance. But did the comedian offer a show of contrition to his accusers? Not exactly.  That didn't appear to matter to the audience, who responded enthusiastically throughout the set.  ""I was a little curious to see if he was going to address the allegations and all that stuff, and he did,"" fan Matthew Bunt said as he left the show. ""I think he did in a very funny and entertaining way,""  Alicia Xavier agreed: ""I loved it, he was relevant, dry and funny, everything I expected and everything I loved about him.""  Too soon for a comeback?  Louis C.K. made his return to stand up comedy in August 2018 with an unannounced appearance at the Comedy Cellar in New York. The show was a hit, prompting a 15-minute standing ovation. Since then, he's performed a string of stand-up gigs at mid-sized venues around the U.S., shows announced without much lead time or publicity, in places like Brooklyn or Cleveland.  Cellphones and recording devices have been forbidden at the comedian's recent U.S. shows (a common practice now for comedians fearing their material would be plagiarised or illegally broadcast). Even note-taking was deemed grounds for ejection from the audience.  But word of the comedian's comeback — and the content of the shows — still got out, prompting some to express their displeasure.  Toronto comedian and actor Marilla Wex (who has appeared in shows like CBC's Working Moms) summarized her initial reactions to announcements of C.K.'s shows as ""outrage and disgust.""    ""The worst part about this is that it's incredibly re-traumatizing for anybody who's suffered sexual abuse, especially the women in entertainment,"" Wex said ahead of Wednesday night's show.  ""Because we're seeing somebody who has admitted what he did, has not really apologized, and is now touring comedy clubs. Great. So what message does it send? It doesn't matter, doesn't matter what he did.""  Other people took umbrage to the content of C.K.'s comeback shows. Specifically, leaked audio from C.K.'s performance in Levittown, N.Y., in Dec. 2018, seemed to suggest he was making fun of the teen survivors of the mass shooting in Parkland, Fla. Some of the parents of the students who died in that shooting were outraged.    Canadian-specific content  The comedian appears to have heeded at least some of that criticism, as the Parkland shooting jokes were notably absent from his first Toronto show, a move that got thumbs-up from Marc Winegust, who attended the performance.  ""Specifically people were hard on the Parkland shooting [bit], he's taken that one out and I think that actually does help settle it a little bit.""    But there was plenty of other material that could raise a few eyebrows. Early on in the show, he expounded on his status as a public pariah, joking that the audience had not seen the worst of him yet as his extensive number of ""blackface photos"" had not yet been published (a joke clearly intended for his Canadian audiences only).  Still, to those who came to see Louis C.K. for his shocking breed of humour, the show didn't disappoint. Departing the stage, he got a standing ovation.",entertainment
407,Sask. welder's Humboldt Broncos-inspired sculpture captures attention from around the world,"In the middle of a cemetery near a small Saskatchewan city sits a sculpture of a girl sitting on a bench. Her head is hung low, cupped in her hands. Like wings, branches stretch from her shoulders and droop down to the bench, nearly bare of any leaves.  From afar, the sculpture appears to have the ridges and bumps of bark, but the entire piece is made of metal welded by local artist Rob Jung.  ""I wanted to convey emotion in it. I wanted it to relay the sadness, the loss, but also hope, and love.""    Jung's art is done in an unconventional studio for an artist. A third-generation welder, he works with his father doing repair work and fabrication in an arc welding shop that his grandfather opened in Melfort, Sask., in the 1950s.  While he's been a welder for roughly 20 years, Jung said he didn't start venturing into artistic pieces until a few years ago when he was inspired by what he was seeing online.  ""The very first thing I saw was a full-sized metal, rusted person with a guitar, and I thought that was just the coolest thing.""  Jung realized after doing some small pieces that the metal sculptures take a lot of commitment, but it was something he wanted to stick with.    After the first few, Jung was asked to make a bench. Having seen metal pieces online of welded bark, Jung gave that a try.  That bench is now part of a piece called Weeping Willow, the sculpture that sits in a meditation garden at Mount Pleasant Cemetery just outside of the city.  Jung said he had the idea for Weeping Willow for some time. The inspiration came from friends of his whose children had passed away. Then, in April 2018, when the Humboldt Broncos bus crash claimed the lives of 16 people and injured 13 others, Jung said he felt compelled to make the vision in his head reality.      This motivation came at a time when Melfort Communities in Bloom was planning the meditation garden at the cemetery. After Jung described the piece to the group, he was commissioned to make it for the garden.    Jung said it came together just as he saw it in his mind. He based the measurements for the girl on the bench off of his young daughter, who helped him on the piece along with his son.  ""I really liked that he thought to incorporate me in his work,"" his 17-year-old daughter, Somer Jung, said. ""It touched me.""  Jung was able to show people the progress of the sculpture online, through a Facebook page and Instagram account.  ""It's unreal how it turned out and how many people followed,"" Jung said. ""I posted everything from start to finish and [it] just got shared all over the world.""  The piece took 333 hours to complete. When Jung posted that online, people began messaging him of the significance of the number, which is often said to be a sign from angels that you're on the right path.    In July, the piece was installed in the meditation garden, which has since won a national award.  Jung said he's received messages from people who have been in the cemetery and seen it themselves.  ""[They] tell me that they went out there and they cried. It just brought so much emotion to them, and that's the kind of art I like doing is something that has more than just something to look at — something that conveys emotion.""     Somer and her brother were about 13 when they first started welding with their father. Somer said she likes being able to see her dad doing something he loves.  ""I liked that he was able to share what he enjoys and that I was able to do that with him and he was willing to teach me.""  Jung seems to feel that as well, as he'd like to be able to do art full time. The shop that's been in his family for three generations is now for sale as his father plans to retire, but his hope is to set up a small shop at his home and work from there.  ""It's very fulfilling. I have so many ideas in my head just nonstop. I have enough to last a lifetime, I think.""",entertainment
408,St. John's skaters ride The Rooms,"  St. John's skateboarders were able to pull off some tricks inside one of the province's most iconic buildings over the weekend, as the Boarder X exhibit stomped its landing at The Rooms.  The contemporary art installation launched with a few days of skateboarding, music and food — and a custom-built halfpipe for anyone to skate.   There were also pros there to teach up-and-coming skaters the ways of the ramp.   But while the ramp was taken apart and towed away after the weekend's launch party, the not-so-typical exhibit will stay at Newfoundland and Labrador's provincial archive and museum until early January.  ""I often joke, if I was a curator at 13 I would've done this show,"" said Jaimie Isaac, curator at the Winnipeg Art Gallery. ""So I'm still thinking about these things, and I'm passionate about it.""  Isaac's idea began with a first installation in Winnipeg in 2016. St. John's is the fourth stop on a tour of Canada, after shows at the Winnipeg Art Gallery, the MacKenzie Art Gallery in Regina, and the Art Gallery of Alberta in Edmonton. It will finish up at the Nanaimo Art Gallery in British Columbia.   The exhibit features pieces from Indigenous artists across the country who skateboard, snowboard and surf, and demonstrates the connected relationships they have with the landscapes around them.    That idea is reflected in the exhibit's name, Boarder X, which looks at the intersection of art, life and the artists' culture, said Isaac, who is a member of Sagkeeng First Nation.  The title alludes to snowboard cross, a competition that features multiple riders. As well, the X points to an intersection of knowledge and experiences.     ""It was so fun to research Indigenous artists who either snowboard, skateboard or surfed — some in the show do it all — and to have conversations with them about our connected relationships between Indigenous culture, boarding and art,"" Isaac said.  Local artists  Boarder X features 11 artists, all of whom have contributed pieces as varying as the individuals themselves. Three of the artists are from Newfoundland and Labrador.  Mark Igloliorte, who grew up in Happy Valley-Goose Bay, said he would often visit coastal Labrador with his father, who is from Hopedale.    ""Having Inuit heritage and then coming here with some work around the Inuit vessel, the kayak, it means a lot to me,"" said Igloliorte, who was in St. John's for the launch, and spent some time riding, grinding and flipping on the halfpipe.  Now living in British Columbia, Igloliorte spent his high school years in Corner Brook where he said he met and bonded with his best friends over skateboarding.  That's where Igloliorte, along with his high school crew, learned their chops on the board, he said.    His work in Boarder X represents both his life as a skateboarder and his roots in Labrador, with videos of skate tricks and kayak flips.  ""So although they come from pretty different worlds, like the skateboard comes from California, but the kayak comes from the Arctic, particular to this province from Nunatsiavut,"" Igloliorte said.    A new audience  The weekend's festivities brought some new faces to The Rooms, something Darryn Doull, the museum's ​​​​​curator of Canadian art, noticed almost immediately.   ""There's an initial conception of skateboarding and skateboarders, of working outside of the rules, making their own rules and maybe breaking things along the way,"" he said.  ""And that's all part of that, but I think if you look beyond that, the really amazing thing is the extremely close community of support that exists within skateboarding. That is very rare to find anywhere else.""    On Saturday's sessions inside the building, skaters of all levels took to the top of the ramp to drop in in front of an onlooking crowd.  Some stood atop the ramp for the very first time, and took their first falls and slams while visitors cheered from outside of a barricade keeping bodies and skateboards contained to a bright, naturally lit corner overlooking St. John's, on The Rooms' second floor.    ""It was just this weird thing that seemed to go through the air, and all of a sudden we were all there cheering them on and watching them succeed,"" Doull said.  ""And that was like a transformative moment in their life, that they have now dropped into a halfpipe for the first time and it happened here. Just being a part of that is something that you can't anticipate,"" he said.  ""It's so incredible and I'm at a sort of loss for words.""  As for Isaac, as a curator herself, she said it's an important practice to involve different pockets of society within art exhibits where, in turn, it becomes a first-time trip to an art gallery for some.  She thinks there's work to be done after the exhibition ships out toward its next stop, in a different gallery, to keep those newcomers coming back.  ""At almost every place where Boarder X has been I've overheard people say, 'This is the first time that I've been to this place and I've lived here all my life.' So that in itself is what is inclusive,"" she said.  ""And you hope that past the exhibition itself those relationships will be maintained and sustained in terms of ongoing presence.""

409,Canadian artist's bronze statue depicting plight of refugees in boat unveiled at St. Peter's Square in Rome,"A Canadian artist's statue depicting ""the different states of mind and emotion"" of refugees in a boat was unveiled Sunday in St. Peter's Square in Rome following a mass by the Pope, who decried indifference to the plight of migrants around the world.  Timothy Schmalz, of Kitchener-Waterloo in southwestern Ontario, created the bronze, six-metre-high Angels Unawares statue that was unveiled in the historic piazza, located in front of St. Peter's Basilica.  The Pope and four refugees from various parts of the world together uncovered Angels Unawares on the World Day for Migrants and Refugees.  Schmalz said his goal in creating Angels Unawares was to elicit the same empathy and identification with the subjects as his Homeless Jesus series, featured in front of churches around the world — in this case, for another group of people often considered a burden to society.  ""I wanted to reflect the different states of mind and emotion involved in a migrant's journey,"" Schmalz, who was in Rome for the unveiling, told CBC. ""Some of the figures are absolutely joyful that they're heading to a new beginning, others are weeping because they've left their loved ones behind.""  While Angels Unawares is a work of art, he said, he also see it as ""an ad for being welcoming to strangers.""  Statue 'shows the faces of the world'  The bronze statute depicts migrants crammed in a raft or boat, and heading for an uncertain future. Their clothing signify they hail from different cultures and historical upheavals, among them a Hasidic Jew escaping Nazi Germany, a Syrian fleeing civil war, a Polish refugee running from the Communist regime.  Hovering above the refugees' heads is a set of angel wings. Schmalz's website says the inspiration for his statue comes from a passage from Hebrews 13:2 in the New Testament: ""Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.""    The Rudolph P. Bratty Family Foundation, a Canadian charity set up by Rudy Bratty, a developer and the son of immigrants from the northern Italian region of Friuli, funded Schmalz's work on Angels Unawares.  In an interview with CBC, Chris Bratty, a third-generation Canadian who was in Rome for the unveiling, said it was ""remarkable to be the patron of this sculpture,"" which ""represents my family over the last 100 years.""  He said Angels Unawares ""represents Canada. Embracing other people is a Canadian trait,"" and the statue ""represents the hope and optimism of immigrants, which is important to Canadians..... that hope and optimism of a new beginning and the chance of a better life. It was important because Tim's sculpture shows the faces of the world.""   The history of Angels Unawares   Schmalz said Rev. Michael Czerny, a Canadian priest and the Pope's top adviser on the issue of migrants and refugees, and himself an immigrant — from Czechoslovakia — had urged him to begin work on a statue addressing migration.  Schmalz said that, after his Homeless Jesus was installed at the Vatican, he and Czerny met, ""and he asked me to come up with a new design on the idea of migration that conveyed that migration is not a crisis, but something that people have done for thousands of years.""  In 2016, the Vatican New Department of Refugees and Migration requested that he create the statue.    Schmalz crafted a small model of the statue first. The Pope, who has made the advocacy of migrants and refugees a central part of his papacy, saw a photograph of the model and asked to bless it, which he did two years ago.  On Oct. 5, Czerny, a Montreal-raised Jesuit who has dedicated his life social justice issues, will be among the 13 men the Pope will elevate to cardinal — the highest rank in the Roman Catholic Church below the pontiff.  Along with the Angels Unawares sculpture now in St. Peter's Square for the next while, on Monday, a 1.5-metre version will be permanently installed in the Basilica of St. Paul Outside the Wall in Rome.  'Something in 3D' moves people, artist says  After the global success of Schmalz's Homeless Jesus series — with one now on its way to the Metropolitan Cathedral of Mexico City and another to be installed outside St. James United Church in Montreal in November — the artist said he has become a huge believer in the power of public art. The statue of a man wrapped against the cold and lying on a public bench is identifiable as Jesus by the holes in his feet.  ""It's that tactile idea, of something in 3D, that can really move people, rather than just seeing a photograph.""     He said numerous people contacted him saying Homeless Jesus moved them to set up homeless programs or donate to shelters in their cities.  With his latest work, Angels Unawares, positioned literally in the epicentre of modern-day Catholicism, the impact, Schmalz hopes, will be all the more transformative – both for those who see it, and his church.  ""A lot of people may think the Vatican is just a museum,"" he said. ""The idea is that the church is not a museum, that it's a living, growing part of our world today.""   ",entertainment
410,"Dan Levy, 'out and proud' Schitt's Creek star, accepts GLAAD award","Canadian Dan Levy, showrunner and star of the TV comedy Schitt's Creek, received a GLAAD award Saturday evening in San Francisco for promoting LGBTQ acceptance and said his personal path, particularly during his formative years in high school, was not an easy one.  ""I think back to that time where I legitimately thought that I'd have to live with this secret — my being gay — for the rest of my life,"" Levy told the audience at the gala event. ""I didn't have the security of seeing a lot of people like myself being celebrated in popular culture.""  GLAAD, an LGBTQ advocacy group, gave the Toronto-born star its Davidsonu002FValentini Award, given to someone who ""has made a significant difference in promoting acceptance for the LGBTQ community,"" according to the GLAAD website.    The award is named after Craig Davidson, GLAAD's first executive director, and his partner Michael Valentini.  Levy joked on stage that as humble Canadians, ""we don't accept things like this well"" and that he was an ""out and proud gay Emmy loser.""  The riches-to-rags sitcom Schitt's Creek, which began on CBC and was co-created with his father Eugene Levy, was a best comedy series nominee at the 2019 Emmy Awards, but lost to the British show Fleabag.     Schitt's Creek centres on a family that loses its fortune and is forced to relocate to a small town. Levy's character, David Rose, is pansexual — meaning he's open to all sexual orientations and gender identities — and as such, became among the first depicted on television.  The character's sexual orientation was explained in the show's first season (using a metaphor of wine) and has been widely commended since for being written with acceptance and without homophobia.  ""I like the wine, and not the label,"" Levy's character famously responds after being asked about it in one of the episodes.    Schitt's Creek cast members Annie Murphy (Alexis Rose), Emily Hampshire (Stevie Budd) and Noah Reid (Patrick Brewer) presented the award.  Levy, who has experienced a steady rise in Hollywood since Schitt's Creek became available in the U.S. through Netflix, signed a three-year deal with Disney's ABC studios recently to develop and produce projects. He took home an MTV Award in June for best comedic performance.     The Canadian has participated in fundraising efforts to support GLAAD. Previous winners of the Davidsonu002FValenti award include CNN host Don Lemon and singer-songwriter Adam Lambert.  Onstage, Levy credited a supportive network of friends and family for giving him the courage to come out during his teenage years.  ""Had I not had the love to give me a sense of security, I don't know if I would have found my way out of the closet, let alone create the opportunity for myself to tell stories on television that have effected some kind of positive change in the world,"" he told the audience.   ""Support, encouragement and love: Three relatively simple acts of kindness that can change the course of a person's life.""  Schitt's Creek scored a Canadian Screen Award earlier this year for best comedy series. Its sixth and final season will begin airing in January.",entertainment
411,Adjusting the pitch: Canadian Opera Company grapples with interpreting Turandot for today,"Even if you've never set foot in an opera house, you've likely heard Nessun Dorma from the opera Turandot.   One of the opera world's instantly recognizable arias, Nessun Dorma (None shall sleep) has also had crossover success: it's Hollywood's soundtrack shorthand for bombastic, climatic scenes; a soccer stadium favourite, and a staple for male singers eager to show off their vocal chops. Aretha Franklin — as a last-minute replacement enlisted to deliver ailing tenor Luciano Pavarotti's signature tune — tore down the 1998 Grammy Awards with her rendition.  An opera house go-to, Turandot is being seen by a wider audience than ever, but that increased exposure has also meant that Giacomo Puccini's final work has joined other classic operas being re-examined through a modern lens.  As the Canadian Opera Company readies to present its new Turandot, the company is grappling with how to stage the mythical, pan-Asian tale set in a China of Puccini's imagination. Productions of the opera have been criticized for showcasing singers in ""yellowface,"" depictions of racial stereotypes, and Orientalism.  When recalling past productions of Turandot he's seen, Toronto performer Richard Lee is blunt.   ""It's offensive,"" he said.     ""I find it really hard to watch art being made that is not as considerate about the communities that it does touch and that it can possibly hurt,"" said the actor, fight director, and sound designer.    The COC tasked Lee, who is of Chinese heritage and a member of the company's equity, diversity, and inclusivity committee, with serving as a production consultant advising the creative team.   ""I am not there to make changes for the artists. I'm there to go, 'Hey, this is something that I see that I have an issue with because I think it can potentially be very hurtful for an audience that comes to watch it,'"" he said on Thursday, the morning after taking in Turandot's dress rehearsal.  ""I'm interested in trying to start conversations with artists, especially artists that don't recognize that there needs to be a change,"" Lee said.   ""I think education of the artists that we have in any community always makes us better as a whole.""  An element Lee raised questions about, for instance, was Turandot's slapstick trio of imperial ministers — Ping, Pang and Pong. Puccini created them as jester-commentators in the Italian comedy tradition, but the trio has often been depicted using negative racial tropes.     Taking into account his notes, the creative team decided to tweak the show for Toronto following earlier debuts in Madrid and Vilnius, Lithuania. The trio has been renamed and given new costumes.  Puccini ""gave the figures naively pseudo-Asian names to place them in the exotically Orientalist world he had created for his early-20th-century audiences. To our ears, these names are dated and offensive, and they now detract from the figures' place in the work as sarcastic, slapstick commentators of the goings-on at court. That is why, in this production, we are calling the three ministers Jim, Bob, and Bill,"" American director Robert Wilson says in a note published by the COC.  ""Often when people stage Turandot it is extravagant fake chinoiserie, using all the clichés of Chinese culture. With Puccini's music, one has to be careful not to do too much. There is an interior beauty to the stories and characters that is often overlooked or lost.""  'Art itself needs to be inclusive'  The name change proved ""a bit jarring"" for Julius Ahn, who sings the newly renamed Bob in Toronto. The Korean-American tenor, who has played the role across North America, believes Turandot is a musical masterpiece that needs no apologies.  ""A lot of complaints that I've heard about this work come from the interpretation ... I've heard 'fake chinoserie' a lot, but that's not in the work. That's actually part of the staging,"" he said. ""It's upon the artists to do a respectful interpretation of the work being presented.""  That doesn't mean only one type of characterization, he added.   ""Why can't we be funny? Why can't we be silly? Why can't we be complex? Why can't we be lighthearted? Why can't we be mean? Can't Asians be crass onstage? For me, art itself needs to be inclusive.""    According to Ahn, what the opera world needs is open discussion between artists and increased diversity across the board — everyone from the singers onstage to those in casting or marketing.  Because Western opera ""traditionally began as work being performed by Caucasians, being told for Caucasians ... artists of colour have had a more difficult time breaking through that barrier,"" said Ahn, who is one of two singers of Asian heritage cast in named roles for the COC's Turandot.      Today, there are so many excellent opera artists from all backgrounds that ""the net needs to be spread wider because there's talent out there,"" he said.  Context is required  Turandot, Otello, Madama Butterfly, Aida — there's a reason many opera fans are devoted to classics despite thorny issues surrounding how to interpret stories with outdated notions for a contemporary audience.  ""Love, jealousy, patriotism and love of country, a sense of wanting to do what's right ... these are issues that will always be important and these are the crux of what opera is,"" says Naomi André, a musicology scholar, professor at the University of Michigan and consultant to the Seattle Opera on matters of race, gender and representation.  While some might suggest it's time to drop problematic operas entirely, André believes the dialogue that's now happening around them is helping to push opera culture forward.    ""It's a bit much to scrap these roles or these operas entirely because these are important works,"" she said from her home in Ann Arbor, Mich. ""But they need to be contextualized and they probably should have been contextualized in the past.""  Watch: Canadian Opera Company altering some of Turandot's Asian characters    In terms of the COC's Turandot, Lee said he appreciates Wilson's minimalist, idiosyncratic aesthetic, which ""lends itself to watching the piece in a way that is not about trying to recreate Asian people onstage, but about really telling the story through these characters.""  But did the production adequately address the elements he had problems with in the past?  ""I'll say personally that I always wish for more. I want more. Is it enough? No, it is absolutely not. But it's a step forward,"" Lee said.  He said his own dream production of Turandot would include ""a stage full of Asians playing those parts, singing the lead [roles],"" along with commentary tackling race and consensual relationships.  The operas we consider classics ""were commissioned. They were inspired by someone to tell a story perhaps that had already been told,"" he said, underlining the mutable nature of the performing arts.  ""So why are so fearful of being brave [and] allow this to inspire us to change?""",entertainment

Sony Pictures Entertainment and The Walt Disney Studios announced on Friday that Marvel Studios will continue to produce the Spider-Man Homecoming series, heading off fans' fears that the popular superhero would disappear from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).   The third film in Spider-Man's current incarnation, starring Tom Holland, will be released on July 16, 2021, the studios said.

414,Doug Ford government scrapping agency that rates films ,"The Ford government is dissolving the independent agency responsible for classifying films screened in Ontario movie theatres.   The Ontario Film Authority (OFA) will no longer issue film ratings starting next Tuesday, according to a Ministry of Government and Consumer Services memo obtained by CBC News.   ""The Ontario Film Authority will be winding down its operations and the ministry will look to the industry to consult on ways to better reflect today's film market,"" says the memo from Michele Sanborn, the assistant deputy minister.   In the short term, says the memo, films screened in Ontario theatres must use the rating issued by British Columbia's film classification body. Longer-term changes are expected next spring. Dissolving the OFA will save the industry $1.5 million to $2 million a year in licensing and classification costs, according to the memo.   Films that go straight online and are never shown in cinemas don't require a rating from the OFA. The trend toward streaming means the agency approved 1,000 fewer films in 2018-19 compared with the previous year.   The OFA was designed to operate on a cost-recovery basis, charging filmmakers fees for issuing ratings such as PG, 14A or Restricted. Its most recent annual report shows the agency brought in $2.2 million in revenue, but ran a shortfall of $130,000.   ""This fiscal year has been a challenging one from a revenue standpoint, primarily due to the 20 per cent decrease in minutes viewed for Englishu002FFrench language films; and 35 per cent decrease in minutes viewed for adult sex films,"" the agency's 2017-18 annual report said.     A spokesperson for Government and Consumer Services Lisa Thompson confirmed Friday the agency is being scrapped, with a ""rapidly changing film market"" as the reason.    ""The major shift to digital platforms and streaming services has significantly changed viewers' behaviour and impacted the OFA's business and revenues, making it unsustainable,"" said Thompson's spokesperson in an email to CBC News.  The government says it intends to modernize the legislation governing film ratings in Ontario.   In a consultation paper published Friday, the government asks the public and the film industry to weigh in.   ""Canada is one of the few countries in the world without a national film classification system,"" says the document. It says the current regime ""requires a distributor wishing to distribute a film across Canada to submit films to five classification bodies and pay seven sets of fees.""   The Wynne government floated the idea of forming a national film rating agency back in 2015, but made no progress on the issue.       ",entertainment
415,Landmark Theaters bans costumes at screenings of Joker movie,"The Landmark Theaters chain said on Thursday it will ban moviegoers from wearing costumes or masks during screenings of the film Joker following concerns by families involved in a 2012 mass shooting during a Batman film in Colorado.  The Los Angeles-based chain, which operates 52 theaters in 27 markets, said it wants its customers to enjoy the film as a ""cinematic achievement.""  ""But no masks, painted faces or costumes will be permitted into our theaters,"" the company said in a written statement provided to Reuters.  Landmark did not give a reason for the ban.  However, the move follows a letter from the families of some of the victims of a shooting at a 2012 showing of the Batman movie The Dark Knight Rises in Aurora, Col., to Warner Bros., the studio behind the Joker, expressing their concerns about the movie.    The film depicts the mental breakdown of the Joker character, the nemesis of Batman in various movie, television and comic book adaptations, that leads to violence.  The letter also urged Warner Bros. to end any political contributions to candidates who take money from the National Rifle Association and to fund gun violence intervention programs.  Some moviegoers in the packed Aurora theater for the midnight screening of The Dark Knight Rises were wearing costumes at that screening.  The mass shooting at the Century 16 Theater multiplex owned by Cinemark USA Inc, left 12 people dead and 70 others wounded.    The gunman, James Holmes, was convicted of mass murder despite pleading not guilty by reason of insanity and is serving multiple life sentences.  Aurora police have said Cinemark will not be screening Joker at the multiplex where the massacre occurred and the department continues to provide enhanced security at the site.    ""We recognize this release may cause concern for the families, friends, first responders and beyond,"" the Aurora Police Department said in a statement on Wednesday.  The film opens in theaters on Oct. 4.",entertainment
416,Andrew Scheer is registered for selective service — the U.S. agency that runs the military draft,"Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer is registered with the U.S. Selective Service System, the federal agency that administers that country's military draft, a party spokesperson confirmed Friday.  Scheer confirmed Thursday that he is a dual Canada-U.S. national — his father was born in the U.S. — but said he is in the process of renouncing his American citizenship.  When asked today why he never made his dual citizenship public, Scheer said nobody had ever asked him about it.  ""Everyone who knows me or knows my family knows that my father was born in the United States,"" Scheer said.  Under U.S. law, all American men between the ages of 18 and 26 must register with the Selective Service System, the U.S. federal agency that maintains information on men who could be conscripted into the military through a system known as ""the draft.""  Scheer was asked today at a campaign event if he had ever registered with the service. He replied that he couldn't say for certain. A party spokesperson later confirmed Scheer had filed the necessary paperwork.  ""Mr. Scheer registered as required by law,"" Simon Jefferies, a spokesperson for Scheer, said in an email.  Registration allows the U.S. government to compile a list of individuals who can be pressed into service in the event of a national emergency, or when ""a rapid expansion of the armed forces is necessary,"" according to the Selective Service System website.  That website also says ""non-citizen and dual national men MUST still register with the Selective Service System. They are not exempt from the registration requirement.""  Failing to register is a felony punishable by a fine of up to $250,000 or a prison term of up to five years, or a combination of both.  Scheer called his dual citizenship a non-issue, given how many other Canadians hold two passports.  ""It's not a big deal for people to have dual citizenship,"" Scheer said. ""There are millions of Canadians who have had a parent born in one country or another. And I've always been tax compliant. I've always followed those laws.""  Scheer said he made the decision to formally begin the process of renouncing his citizen in August 2019. He said he has not held a valid U.S. passport in years.  ""Just because his passport is lapsed doesn't mean he's not an American,"" Washington-based immigration lawyer Len Saunder said in an interview.  ""He's absolutely considered an American under immigration laws. I'm surprised he didn't renounce his citizenship a long time ago. If he does win the election, he's still going to be an American citizen. It takes months.""  Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau said Scheer should have been upfront about American citizenship.  ""I think there is nothing about having a dual citizenship that should disqualify anyone from being a politician. But I do think that you have to be honest with Canadians when you're applying for a job to be the prime minister for thirty seven million Canadians I think that's what Mr. Scheer has to answer for,"" Trudeau said.    U.S. citizenship comes with many rights and privileges — the freedom to live, work and vote in the world's largest economy — but it also carries unique responsibilities that the U.S. demands of its citizens.  For example, under U.S. tax law, an American citizen living anywhere in the world must report their global income and file returns with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). U.S. citizens must file income, estate and gift tax returns with the IRS.  Scheer has said he has filed U.S. tax returns.    Moreover, under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, all U.S. citizens also must tell federal authorities about their foreign accounts, such as bank accounts, brokerage accounts and mutual funds.  Those American citizens must file a report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts, or FBAR, with the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.  There's a $12,921 penalty for non-willful violations, while individuals who deliberately evade the law could face fines of up to $129,210, or 50 per cent of the account's value.",politics
417,Trudeau government seeks judicial review in decision to compensate First Nations kids,"The Liberal government led by Justin Trudeau is challenging a landmark human rights ruling to compensate apprehended First Nations children harmed by the on-reserve child welfare system.  The Attorney General of Canada filed with the Federal Court today an application for a judicial review and for a stay of the ruling — just two weeks before the federal election and days before the Oct. 7 deadline for filing an appeal.  The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal ordered the federal government on Sept. 6 to pay $40,000 — the maximum allowed under the Canadian Human Rights Act — to each child taken from homes and communities under the on-reserve child welfare system from Jan.1, 2006, to a date to be determined by the tribunal.  The ruling also directed Ottawa to compensate some of the parents and grandparents of children who were apprehended.  The decision could leave the federal government on the hook for billions of dollars in compensation.     Ottawa ordered to compensate First Nations children impacted by on-reserve child welfare system    Trudeau ducks question on whether he'd accept First Nations child welfare compensation ruling     Scheer says he'd seek 'judicial review' of First Nation child welfare compensation     Cindy Blackstock, executive director of the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society, told CBC News on Thursday that an appeal of the decision would perpetuate ""racial discrimination of the worst kind.""    ""It is the federal government's discriminatory conduct that needs review and reform — not the legal decision that flagged the problem and ordered the discrimination to stop,"" she said.  Ottawa's application calls for an order setting aside the tribunal's decision and dismissing the claim for monetary compensation. In the absence of such an order, the federal government is asking for an order setting aside the tribunal's decision and referring the matter back to the tribunal for review in accordance with directions set by the Federal Court.   The federal government's application says Canada acknowledges the finding of systematic discrimination and does not oppose the general principle of compensating First Nations kids — but it argues the ruling was inconsistent with the nature of the complaint, the evidence, past jurisprudence and the Canadian Human Rights Act.  In a statement released by his office, Indigenous Services Minister Seamus O'Regan said the government agrees affected individuals should be compensated — but it wants time to ""address important questions and considerations such as who is to be compensated and the role of the Tribunal.""  ""In order to give us both clarity on the ruling and time to have these conversations with our partners, which are not possible during an election, we are seeking a judicial review and stay,"" says the statement.  Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said on Thursday that he would seek a judicial review if he was prime minister.   ""This is a far-reaching decision that has major impacts on multiple levels of government,"" Scheer said.  ""It would be appropriate to have a judicial review.""  Scheer has not said specifically what a Conservative government would do with this file if it forms government after Oct. 21.  NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and Green Party Leader Elizabeth May have both said they would offer compensation at the level ordered by the tribunal.  Trudeau ducked questions Thursday when asked what a re-elected Liberal government would do.  ""From the Sixties Scoop to the relocations, to the tuberculosis among the Inuit, we have always moved forward in a responsible way to compensate, to support people, and we will continue to do that as we move forward,"" Trudeau said.  ""We're going to continue to work with Indigenous communities, work with Indigenous leaders, to make sure that there is proper compensation.""    National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations Perry Bellegarde has called on every party leader to commit to honouring the ruling.  ""This is about supporting First Nations children and families and respecting human rights,"" Bellegarde wrote in a tweet.  ""It is unconscionable that anyone would oppose this.""  Some estimates place the number of potentially affected children at about 50,000, with the largest numbers in the Prairies and British Columbia. The ruling also covers First Nation children in the Yukon territory.  Ballot box issue  Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond, a lawyer and former child and youth advocate for British Columbia, said she wants the party that forms the next government to work out a new path for First Nation children and families.  ""The recognition that they deserve respect and support is long overdue,"" Turpel-Laford said. ""The time for fighting First Nation children and families is over.""    The tribunal ordered Ottawa to enter discussions with the First Nations Family Caring Society and the Assembly of First Nations — which filed the initial human rights complaint in 2007 — to determine the best independent process to distribute the compensation and decide who qualifies.  It gave the parties until Dec. 10 to come to the tribunal with proposals.  Blackstock said voters should consider where all political parties stand on the ruling when they head to the ballot box.  ""I find Canadians really are wanting to see First Nation children being treated fairly and justly,"" Blackstock said.  ""I think they're way out in front of the political parties in many ways on this.""",politics
418,Trudeau says his personal stance on abortion has 'evolved' ,"Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau said today his personal views on abortion have ""evolved"" in the years since he stated that, while he opposed abortion personally, he supported a woman's right to choose.  While defending his Catholic faith in a 2011 article, Trudeau said he was personally opposed to abortion but believed nobody should tell a woman what she should do with her body.  ""I expressed something I no longer believe,"" Trudeau told reporters Friday during a stop in Quebec City, when asked about that article. ""I evolved pass that particular perspective.  ""I no longer feel like I can or need to say that I'm against abortion. That is not for me, as a man, to say.""  The Liberal camp has worked to make Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer's personal views on abortion an issue in this election campaign.    Earlier this week, Trudeau and the NDP and Bloc leaders pressed Scheer during a French election debate to say how he feels personally about abortion. Scheer tried to side-step the question, saying the abortion debate in Canada is settled.  The next morning, Scheer, a practising Catholic, said he is personally opposed to abortion but insisted again that a Conservative government led by him would not move to restrict access to the procedure.  Scheer says he's 'personally pro-life'  ""I am personally pro-life but I've also made the commitment that, as leader of this party, it is my responsibility to ensure that we do not re-open this debate, that we focus on issues that unite our party and unite Canadians,"" Scheer said Thursday.  When running for the party's leadership in 2017, Scheer told the anti-abortion group RightNow that he would allow ""freedom of conscience"" for backbenchers.    ""I can assure you that I support the right to individual MPs to speak out and bring, introduce matters that are important to them, but our party policy is clear on that and I think in order to maintain unity of our caucus it's important that the prime minister respects that,"" he said.  In that interview, Scheer, a known social conservative, also said he has always voted in favour of ""pro-life"" legislation.",politics
419,Liberals' 2 campaign planes and their carbon offsets draw Scheer's ire,"Maybe it's questionable optics for Justin Trudeau's campaign to be using two planes during this federal campaign when other campaigns are making do with one (or none).  But it's also true that better optics aren't going to save the planet.  It's a familiar complaint, particularly from those who are critical of climate-change activists — that the people calling for a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions also participate in activities that produce greenhouse gas emissions.  Nearly every international summit on the topic of climate change raises questions about the air travel that was required for participants to attend. The allegation of personal contradiction is used to disqualify the political cause.  Those criticisms, mostly coming from the political right, have been joined by a movement on the left known as ""flight-shaming,"" which aims to discourage the general public use of emissions-intensive air travel — Greta Thunberg, the international climate activist, recently opted to travel by boat across the Atlantic Ocean to attend the United Nations' climate summit in New York.  So it's not surprising that the federal Conservatives are now trying to make something of the fact that the Liberal leader's national tour is using two planes, a complaint that Andrew Scheer dropped on Trudeau in the middle of Wednesday night's leaders' debate on TVA.  Trudeau uses carbon offsets  In response, Trudeau and the Liberals noted the Liberal Party is purchasing carbon offsets to compensate for the GHGs produced by their campaign travel. In this case, the party's carbon offset contributions are going toward the Essex‐Windsor Regional Landfill Gas Capture and Destruction Project in Essex, Ontario.  The Conservative Party is using just one plane, but it's not purchasing offsets for the emissions its campaign has produced.  (The Liberal government's own federal carbon levy also applies to jet fuel.)    Speaking to reporters on Thursday morning, Scheer dismissed the Liberal decision to purchase those offsets.  ""I don't buy Mr. Trudeau's excuse that somehow purchasing some credits excuses him — gives him the privilege to burn more fuel,"" he said.  Ironically, a substantial portion of Scheer's climate platforms rests on the promise that, instead of focusing primarily on domestic emissions, a Conservative government would aim to help other countries reduce their emissions — to effectively offset the production of GHGs in Canada.    Would Scheer's Conservatives be more supportive of Trudeau's climate agenda if his campaign used only one plane, or if he abandoned air travel entirely? Likely not.  But it's a handy cudgel when you're trying to make the case that Justin Trudeau is not who he claims to be — that he's ""not as advertised"" and more style than substance. It doesn't hurt that using two planes sounds like the sort of thing an entitled rich guy would do — note Scheer's use of the word ""privilege."" (Party leaders don't pay for their own campaigns, of course.)  Insofar as critics are always quick to allege hypocrisy, the Liberals might have tried to transport their campaign more efficiently. If you're asking the average citizen to pay a bit more for gas — even if the revenue is rebated to households — you are always going to be vulnerable to a charge that you somehow don't face the same burden.    Trudeau hasn't told people to stop flying. But, similar to his support for the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, it's easy to suggest he has contradicted his commitment to combating climate change.   Lead by example  There is likely also something to be said for leading by example — and it's not like Trudeau doesn't understand the potential weight of symbols. Perhaps Trudeau should be demonstrating climate consciousness, or even sacrifice.  That probably wouldn't hurt the cause. But there are surely limits to how much it would help — inspiring even a large number of people to bike to work more or fly less would go a relatively small way toward Canada reaching its international climate targets.    But the problem of climate change isn't simply a matter of millions of individual choices, so much as it's a matter of systems and structures and available options. If, for the past 50 years, clean energy had been cheaper and more bountiful than other fuels and zero-emission transportation had been readily available to all Canadians — and if the environmental damages of burning fossil fuels had always been priced into the consumer cost — we might not be in our current situation.  Individual choices and examples do matter. But there's a lot more going on here.  Actions are important  A political leader is uniquely positioned to drive meaningful changes — not by biking to work, but by leading a government that can propose and implement significant climate policies. Yes, he or she can lead by example. But they can do a lot more by passing laws and regulations and spending public funds to restrain emissions and encourage the development of cleaner technology.   Optics aren't unimportant. But once the campaign is over, someone gets to implement actual policies.    Elections are generally about competing proposals to do such things.  Even before this campaign began, the Liberal and Conservative climate plans were found to be as much as 100 megatonnes of emissions per year apart.  That's a lot of plane rides.",politics
420,"Conservative candidate with controversial views on LGBTQ rights skips debate, avoids media","It's one of the time-honoured traditions of election campaigns: the candidates face off in debates, present their views and positions and defend them against challenges from the moderator and opponents.  The Simon Fraser Student Society held such a debate Thursday night at the Burnaby university campus. It was attended by three of the major parties' local candidates — but the Conservative candidate for Burnaby North-Seymour, Heather Leung, was notably absent, despite an invitation from organizers.  Leung's decision to skip the debate wouldn't have surprised anyone following her campaign. She doesn't appear to have granted any media interviews since the campaign officially began Sept. 11, nor in the weeks before that.  Controversial positions  The Conservative constituency association in her riding briefly made national headlines when Rick Mercer was misquoted in a post on social media. An image of Mercer was posted by the Burnaby North-Seymour Conservative Constituency Association with a quote altered to make it look as though the comedian was endorsing the Conservatives.  A local newspaper, Burnaby Now, has documented its months-long effort to get in touch with Leung — in particular to ask about her reported intention to vote against abortion rights if elected.  In a column this week questioning Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer's vow not to re-open social issues like abortion and same-sex marriage, the Vancouver Sun cited Leung's socially conservative positions — and an undated video in which she discusses conversion therapy and at one point refers to the ""perverted homosexual lifestyle.""  In another video linked off the Burnaby Now website, Leung said that, because ""homosexual people, they cannot reproduce ... they recruit more people ... into their camp.""  Asked about that second video at a campaign stop in Etobicoke, Ont. today, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer did not comment on the candidate herself.  ""I haven't seen this particular video that you're referencing, of course,"" he said. ""Our party stands for inclusiveness ... and will always do so.""  Interview requests  CBC News made multiple attempts this week to contact Leung for an interview.  At her campaign office, campaign staffer Travis Trost said Leung had another commitment and couldn't speak with CBC News on Wednesday, but might be able to on Thursday.    Trost emailed on Thursday to say ""an interview with Heather is not going to work today for a variety of reasons.""  Asked if Leung had granted any interviews throughout the campaign, Trost referred to a CTV News story in which the reporter said the campaign manager was in the process of setting up an on-camera interview with the candidate, but was ""strong-armed by higher-ups in the party.""    An interview request sent by CBC News to Morgan Swan, regional press officer for the Conservatives, was also declined.  ""Unfortunately Heather is not doing interviews at the moment as she is focused on her door knocking,"" Swan wrote, offering to send policy information or set up a conversation with someone else.  Campaign strategy  Colin Metcalfe, a consultant who has worked on Conservative campaigns in the past, said that for some candidates, door-knocking is the best way to spend the limited time leading up to an election.  ""It's the most efficient use of your time,"" said Metcalfe. ""When you do an interview, when you reach out to however many people read, listen or watch that story, you still don't know how many people are inclined to vote for you.""    Metcalfe said the best way for a candidate to identify likely supporters is to go door to door.  He said some candidates are naturals on television and in debates, while others require significant amounts of time to prepare. Metcalfe also said more than 90 per cent of voters make their decisions based on national campaigns — not local candidates.  In terms of Leung's plans leading up to the election, Trost said ""we are going to move forward with Heather being as active as possible"" — but didn't say whether she would be available to speak with journalists.

421,"If Scheer wants to stop being questioned on his views on gay marriage, he should offer an answer: Robyn Urback","No doubt the Conservatives are frustrated that leader Andrew Scheer keeps getting the same question over and over on the campaign trail: Can you explain how your personal views on same-sex marriage have evolved since 2005?  Yet it apparently has not occurred to the party — or else, they prefer not to acknowledge — that the best way to get people to stop asking the question is to answer it. To really answer it.    Scheer has been asked to explain his personal evolution on LGBTQ rights multiple times: back in August, after the Liberals unearthed footage from 2005 of a young Scheer arguing against gay marriage in a speech in Parliament; in September, in the context of Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau offering his own apology for past behaviour; and earlier this week, in conversation with the CBC's Rosemary Barton.   Each time, the question is some variation on the following: How, and when, and why did your views on same-sex marriage shift?  And each time, Scheer offers up something that sounds like an answer but is really just a collection of banal observations about how Canadian society has evolved. It's like being asked what topping you want on your hamburger and responding with a dopey: ""Yes, I like hamburgers.""  'I've moved on'  Scheer's script is always the same: ""My personal views are that every single Canadian has the same equality rights under the law.""  ""It is the law of the land. It's been settled in Canada.""  ""Society has moved on. I've moved on.""  ""Yes, I like hamburgers.""    The question, of course, is not about how our collective views on same-sex marriage have changed but how Scheer personally went from believing gay marriage was as weird and unnatural as calling a dog's tail a leg to thinking same-sex marriage is totally fine.  ""I've moved on"" is not an answer to this question. (And yes, I know, Trudeau has quite an affinity for this type of dodge also, but the whole purpose of being the ""change"" option is to convince Canadians you will be different.)    Conservatives would argue that Scheer's personal views on same-sex marriage shouldn't matter because he has promised that he will not reopen the debate. That is a fine perspective to take if your fixation is on how elections should be decided instead of recognizing how they are actually decided.   Part of the Liberals' get-out-the-vote strategy is very clearly to convince moderate voters that Scheer isn't worth the risk: that, sure, he says he won't reopen debates on social issues, but can you really believe him, especially when he won't go into detail about how his personal beliefs have changed? Scheer's obfuscation just plays into this narrative.    Just recently, the Conservative leader decided to be more forthright on his views on abortion. Speaking to reporters in New Brunswick Thursday, he confirmed that he is ""personally pro-life"" but that he will ""ensure that we do not reopen this debate.""     This was presumably an easier admission for Scheer given that the news that he is against abortion is hardly a revelation. It's also easier to defend a position when your stated justification is to preserve life as opposed to one where you're imposing your moral and religious beliefs on others simply to preserve an entrenched idea about the institution of marriage.  I don't actually know if Scheer still personally views it as wrong for two men or two women to marry. I don't know, because he won't say — which, in many people's minds, is just his clumsy way of saying he still views it as wrong (while conveniently denying his opponents the sound bite).    The Conservatives appear to have concluded that letting people make that assumption is preferable to Scheer actually providing a fulsome answer — an answer through which he could provide nuance, context and perhaps also explain how he grapples with conflicting religious doctrines that teach tolerance and acceptance but also intolerance of certain practices.  There are probably a good number of Canadians who could relate to that conflict.  There is no question the Liberals would weaponize whatever Scheer says, stripping out all of that nuance and context. But it's unlikely that it would be any worse than the image Scheer is projecting now: one of cageyness, suspicion and a brand of dogmatism he's too meek to own. In that light, it is difficult to see how Scheer's current strategy is the preferred option, especially since avoiding the question is the best guarantee that it will keep coming up.

Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau's time in the hot seat came Monday and Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer had his turn Tuesday. Green Party Leader Elizabeth May's Face to Face special was recorded on Tuesday but broadcast on CBC on Wednesday.   One of the undecided voters who spoke to Singh was Lauren Tintoni, 40, from Toronto. She is married with a three-year-old son and has concerns about Singh's ability to roll out his national child-care plan in time for her to have a second child.

424,"ANALYSIS | Does the West want out? Not really, but the rallying cry needs to be heard","There's been no end of headlines about western alienation and separation.  While the sentiment exists across the Prairies, Alberta is ground zero, and it's the Alberta premier who has been chief among those sounding the alarm.   Jason Kenney, who is quick to assure Canadians he's an avowed federalist, often uses the ""unity crisis"" rallying cry to pivot to partisan politics.  In this Aug. 3 video posted to social media, Kenney's core message is clear: ""Rather than focusing on Alberta separating from the Canadian federation, I'd like to focus on separating Justin Trudeau from the Prime Minister's Office"".    Similar exhortations from Kenney, specifically citing a separatist surge, have dwindled after several months of a steady theme.  In fact, there has been a perceptible shift, with Kenney now talking more about Alberta's nation-building role and the province's integral place within Confederation.  There's no mystery as to why.  Tinder dry sentiments are easy to ignite  There is a danger that whatever frustration and anger is out there could be inflamed further and become politically explosive.  Kenney knows this.  Keep stirring it up and soon an ember is a fire.  However, Alberta-based pollster Janet Brown argues it's his job to reflect a sentiment that is deep and abiding in many Albertans.   ""There is really a sense of frustration here,"" Brown says.  ""When people talk about separation, mostly it's just an expression of frustration, rather than a clear desire to separate.""  If anyone understands how that frustration can grow and fester, it's the man who turned ""The West Wants In"" into a movement that challenged political orthodoxy.  Preston Manning, the founding leader of the Reform Party, offers a warning.    ""The challenge, I think, is to try to channel that energy and that anger and disillusionment into some constructive change, rather than just tearing things apart. And that's going to be a challenge for the next Parliament, no matter who ends up winning the next election,"" Manning says.    Brown thinks the winner does matter.   ""Western separatism ebbs and flows depending on who is in government, and I think the fact there is a Liberal government federally is one of the things that's sort of driving that frustration,"" she says.  Been there, done that  The Western Canada Concept Party managed to elect Gordon Kesler in a provincial byelection in 1982. It was the first and only electoral win by a separatist outside of Quebec.  Just months later, the party won close to 12 per cent of the vote in the provincial election, but that support didn't translate into seats — including Kesler's.  This was the National Energy Program (NEP) era, so anger at Ottawa was visceral and profound in Alberta.  Former Reform and later CPC MP and cabinet minister Monte Solberg wrote about western alienation earlier this year.    He says, despite today's grievances over pipelines and equalization, ""nothing, but nothing, approaches the damage done by the NEP.""  So a separatist resurgence is possible, but not probable.  In fact, Brown says based on her scanning of the various polls on alienation and separation in recent months, while there is a clear sentiment favouring separation that garners substantial support, it should be viewed with caution.    ""When you dive even deeper (into the polls)... those people are saying I'm going to answer this way on the poll because I want somebody to hear me and I want somebody to hear how frustrated I am,"" Brown says.  Solberg writes that ""western separation is not many people's first choice, it's also not very realistic.""   But he also argues that years of policies which have stymied Alberta's prime industry means ""the only dignified response is righteous anger… the West didn't pull away until it was pushed away.""   A nascent group dubbed Wexit says its slogan is ""The West Wants Out.""  View from the ground  We brought together members of a focus group, assembled by Brown as part of a poll commissioned by CBC Calgary, to hear directly from voters about this. They largely echo Solberg's view.  Stephen Carlton spent a career in the resource sector. He says, ""I'm not a separatist. I'm a Canadian first and foremost. But, you know, with the continued aspect that we feel powerless here, separation, is that a viable plan B if we can't work this out?""     That's the question being asked by many, including James Vy, who also makes his living in oil and gas.  ""You know. I don't think it'd be a good idea. I don't know what it looks like after Alberta does separate,"" Vy says.  Carla Paradis, an entrepreneur with rural roots, says she wants ""to get back on the same page as the rest of Canada.""  Kenney shifts tone  Kenney's message has evolved from angry and stark warnings about a burgeoning unity crisis a few months ago, to a pitch arguing that the Constitution is on the side of Alberta.  This is directly linked to his stumping for Andrew Scheer and his challenges to the federal carbon tax and Bills C-48 and 69; one a B.C tanker ban, and the other a new assessment process he argues blocks future pipelines.  It's also true that there is an inherent danger in stirring up separatist sentiment.    This week, when asked about the re-election of a Trudeau government, he replied, ""Honestly, I think that frustration will go off the charts."" But he didn't characterize that frustration in the context of unity or separatist sentiment.  What is also very telling is his response to a question about equalization — a formula he's railed against as being profoundly unfair.  When a reporter asked whether he'd raised the subject with any federal leaders and, further, if any of them had made any commitments to changes, the reply was a curt ""no and no"" and on to the next question.  Now what?  No question, many Albertans are angry. They're also anxious, fearful, bewildered and, in some cases, feeling defeated.  Brown explains the zeitgeist Kenney is channelling is rooted in a perceived ""hypocrisy in the way Alberta is dealt with.""  She goes on to explain, ""The rest of Canada is happy to take equalization from Alberta. They're happy to benefit from the prosperity that Alberta has. But then at the same time, they're going to turn around and try and block Alberta's key industry.""    Of course that conclusion can be rebutted and rejected, but as Manning says, it needs also to be acknowledged. ""The populist dimension of western alienation can't be ignored; it has to be addressed.""  ""I think the challenge for others is to recognize the validity of the concerns and don't dismiss them and don't tell people you've got no right to be angry or mad but to try to provide a constructive alternative,"" Manning says.  Whether that can be accomplished at the ballot box on Oct. 21 is anyone's guess.

425,Singh's claim that Liberal trade concessions will drive up drug prices oversimplified,"As part of our federal election coverage, CBC News is assessing the truthfulness and accuracy of statements made by politicians and their parties.  The Claim: ""Mr. Trudeau made those concessions that are going to drive up the cost of medication.""  — NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh on how the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement on trade could impact prices of some drugs in Canada.  The Facts:  The NDP leader has frequently criticized several aspects of the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA), a trilateral trade deal negotiated over an 18-month period by the current Liberal government.   The deal hasn't been ratified and, given the caustic political climate south of the border, it faces an uncertain fate.  Precarious future aside, Singh has taken issue with several contentious provisions in the agreement, including one that would influence the development and sale of some pharmaceuticals in Canada.  Specifically, a part of the deal that involves the ""data protection"" period for a burgeoning class of drugs called biologics.    Let's break that down.  Biologics are used to treat a wide range conditions, such as Crohn's disease and forms of arthritis, as well as some autoimmune-related diseases. They are among the most costly drugs available today, and represent a growing share of pharmaceuticals sold in Canada.  Biologics expensive  By 2017, for example, seven of the top 10 medicines contributing to growth in patented drug sales in Canada were biologics, according to the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board. Annual treatment costs that year ranged from $2,948 to $57,928.   A protection period refers to the amount of time that data generated in clinical trials for a new medicine is off-limits to generic drug manufacturers.  Pharmaceutical companies are required to submit that data to regulatory bodies before a drug can be approved. After a certain duration, generic drug makers can access it to help produce cheaper alternatives.  In other words, the longer the data protection period, the longer a pharmaceutical company can exclusively profit from the sale of a brand-name drug without the threat of competition from generic options.  During the CUSMA negotiations, Canada agreed to extend the data protection period for biologics to 10 years from eight.  The change would mean that, in some instances it would take at least two years longer for cheaper alternatives to brand-name drugs to become available.    There's an important distinction here: the prices of currently available drugs would not go up, rather Canadians prescribed future biologics would need to purchase the name-brand version for two years longer than if CUSMA was never negotiated.   Won't be felt for years  The effects of the change wouldn't be felt until eight years after the agreement is ratified, because even without it, data on biologics is already protected for that long in Canada.    The concession was pursued by representatives from the U.S., where clinical data on biologics is protected for 12 years.  Lengthening Canada's data protection period has long been a goal of the American pharmaceutical lobby, said Joel Lexchin, a professor emeritus at York University's School of Health Policy and Management and emergency room physician.   ""Just follow the money. The drug companies that make biologics wanted the change,"" he said. ""And the drug industry in the U.S. is very powerful.""    Just how much a 10-year timeframe would cost the Canadian health-care system is difficult to estimate, Lexchin said.   In an April report, the Parliamentary Budget Office found that, by 2029, the data protection period extension for biologics could increase total annual costs for Canadian consumers and drug plans by at least $169-million. The added costs would continue to rise each year after, the PBO said.  But, as the PBO noted, any analysis of potential future costs is complicated by patents.   Pharmaceutical patents can last for 20 years. Therefore in instances in which a drug is covered by a 20-year patent, the data protection period will expire years before the patent does. That is to say, a longer protection period wouldn't be the most important factor in when cheaper alternatives could become available.  Many variables in the mix  This had led some experts to project that the change could have little impact on health-care expenditures in the future, assuming many future biologics will have a 20-year patent.   But biologics are complex drugs, and the patent process is not always straightforward. There are a number of foreseeable scenarios in which the protection period is the limiting element, Lexchin said.   The number of variables in the mix means that projections are, at best, educated guesses.  Verdict: It's complicated. If CUSMA is ratified, Canadians would likely have to pay more for some biologics for longer than they would have otherwise. But how much it will ultimately cost individual Canadians and the Canadian health-care system will depend largely on future pharmaceutical patents.

426,Andrew Scheer says he's renouncing U.S. citizenship after confirming he is a dual citizen,"Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer is a dual citizen of Canada and the United States.  The Globe and Mail reported Thursday that Scheer's father is an American by birth and passed along the citizenship to Scheer and his siblings.  Daniel Schow, a spokesperson for the party, confirmed Thursday Scheer decided to renounce the citizenship after he became Conservative leader.  Schow said Scheer started the process of renouncing his citizenship in August, before the federal election campaign started, and the paperwork is now being processed by the U.S. government.  ""Like millions of Canadians, one of Mr. Scheer's parents was born in another country and immigrated to Canada to start a family. He and his sisters received United States passports as children and Mr. Scheer has not renewed his as an adult. He has not voted in any United States election,"" Schow said in a statement.  The current wait time to renounce U.S. citizenship is roughly nine to 10 months for applications filed at the U.S. embassy in Ottawa.  When asked Thursday why he has not previously disclosed his U.S. ancestry, Scheer said nobody ever asked him.  ""I've never tried to hide that,"" he said in a scrum with reporters in Halifax. ""I've never been asked about it by Canadians. My father has always been open about where he comes from. I haven't been asked about it.""  Asked about why he's motivated to renounce his citizenship now on the eve of an election, Scheer said it's a personal decision. ""I was born in Canada ... I grew up my whole life in Canada,"" he said.    As required by U.S. tax law, Scheer said he has reported his income and filed returns with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  The leader has faced questions about his past in recent days after it was confirmed Scheer was never actually licensed to sell insurance, even though his party biography cited his past work experience as an ""insurance broker.""  Scheer has said since he was accredited but never licensed to sell insurance at the Regina firm he worked at for six months before he was elected to Parliament at the age of 25 in 2004. Scheer's private sector experience includes this short stint in the insurance world and waiting tables at restaurants while in university.  Scheer raised questions about Jean's citizenship  Scheer raised concerns about former governor general Michaëlle Jean holding both Canadian and French passports in a 2005 blog post.  ""I have a few quick questions for anyone who thinks that Michaëlle Jean is a good choice to be our next GG,"" Scheer wrote. ""What are her qualifications? What experience does she have that would assist her to carry out her duties as our head of state, including the potential to be a referee in a minority government situation?""    He also asked his constituents if they felt it was appropriate for Jean to maintain her French passport. ""Would it bother you if instead of French citizenship, she held U.S. citizenship?"" Scheer asked.  Speaking Thursday, Scheer said he wasn't attacking Jean, but rather he was just asking questions of his constituents.    Jean renounced her French citizenship before she was sworn in as governor general and commander-in-chief of the Canadian Forces in 2005.  Liberal spokesperson Zita Astravas said Scheer has been ""fundamentally dishonest with Canadians about who he is.""  ""Scheer's hidden his core personal positions, he hid facts about his career and education and now he's been caught hiding his American citizenship even while ridiculing others for holding dual citizenship ....  ""How can Canadians trust him when he talks about what he'll do, including what he'll cut?""    Under the leadership of former prime minister Stephen Harper, the Conservative Party accused former Liberal leader Stéphane Dion and former NDP leader Tom Mulcair of having divided loyalties as both men had dual Canadian and French citizenship while holding public office.  When asked about Mulcair's citizenship, Harper said in 2015 it was up to Mulcair to decide whether to keep the French passport or give it up. ""In my case, as I say, I'm very clear. I'm a Canadian and only a Canadian,"" Harper said.  A past CBC News investigation found at least 56 parliamentarians from the 2015-19 Parliament, including 44 MPs and 12 senators, were born outside Canada. At least 22 of them have citizenship from other countries. Scheer's U.S. citizenship was not then widely known.",politics

429,Liberals remove campaign video from Facebook that featured Julie Payette,"The Liberals have removed a promotional video from leader Justin Trudeau's Facebook page that featured behind-the-scenes footage from the first day of the election campaign, including video of Gov. Gen. Julie Payette inside Rideau Hall.  Forward TV Part 1, which was posted to Trudeau's page on Tuesday, appeared to be the first in a series of documentary-style short films that take voters behind the Liberal campaign curtain.   The first episode was about six minutes long and began with Trudeau and Sophie Gregoire Trudeau getting their kids ready for school before going to Rideau Hall to meet the Governor General and get the paperwork required to launch the federal election.   Those scenes inside the Governor General's residence show Payette signing official documents with Trudeau at her side.

Dufresne did not directly respond to CBC News's question as to whether Rideau Hall had asked the Liberal Party to have the video removed or edited.

430,"Clashes over values, SNC-Lavalin and role of the Bloc at 1st French-language debate","Four of the major party leaders sparred Wednesday night in a French-language debate that saw Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau try to paint his Conservative opponent as a man out of step with Quebec values.  Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet made an impassioned plea to Quebecers to send more separatist MPs to Ottawa to fight for the province's interests, while Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer urged voters to reject the Bloc's advances and elect Tories to make Trudeau a one-term prime minister.  NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said he'd fight for ""asymmetrical"" federalism to ensure Quebec's uniqueness is better represented in the federation. He promised to help the province better integrate newcomers into the dominant French culture so as to protect the language's place in Canada.  The debate, hosted by TVA, the most watched network in Quebec, was billed as a ""face-à-face"" — a chance for the leaders to debate one another directly.  The topics were wide-ranging and covered everything from the state of Ottawa's finances, climate change, the Quebec secularism law, protections for arts and culture and the place of francophones in Canada.  Scheer 'doesn't share our values': Trudeau  Trudeau started the night on the offensive, trying to pin Scheer down on issues like same-sex marriage and abortion.  He repeatedly asked the Conservative leader to state clearly what his personal feelings are on these social issues.  ""Answer me this — do you believe women have the right to choose? Yes or no,"" Trudeau said.  Trudeau and Scheer spar on abortion in TVA debate (Courtesy of TVA)    Scheer didn't answer, but repeated his promise that a Conservative government led by him would not reopen these divisive debates.  ""You hide with each answer,"" Trudeau said. ""We are seeing that the three of us are aligned with the values of Quebecers and we have a fourth, a Conservative party, that is not aligned with either women's rights or LGBTQ rights.""  When asked about a Quebec court decision that found parts of both the federal and provincial medically assisted dying laws too restrictive, Trudeau said the current law on medical assistance in dying might be too limited. But he used the moment to hammer Scheer on opposing such a law in the first place.     Quebec judge overturns parts of federal, provincial laws on medically assisted dying    At a post-debate press conference, Scheer said like many Quebecers, he is Catholic. (The church is opposed to abortion and assisted death on religious grounds.) But the Conservative leader said he will govern for all Canadians and it would be status quo on abortion and same-sex marriage rights.  Watch: Scheer post-debate scrum (in English)    Trudeau said on these issues, but also on the fight against climate change, Scheer doesn't ""share our values."" As for the Bloc, he said it will always be an opposition party.  ""We need Quebecers in government to fight climate change,"" Trudeau said.      How do the main parties compare on the issues?     Singh was asked about his views on Quebec's secularism law, which he has said he opposes but has also said he would not challenge as prime minister. In answering, Singh attempted to convince Quebecers he shared their values on several issues.   ""Well, I said clearly that this law is discriminatory. I am opposed to discriminatory laws. I am in favour of laws that bring people together — we should always try to bring people together,"" Singh said in French. ""Mr. Blanchet wants to dwell on the past and on quarrels, but I am focusing on where people need help.""  ""Quebecers are sensitive to secularism, I understand that reality, it is a very strong tradition. I am in favour of the separation between church and state,"" Singh continued. ""And I am in favour of (choice) in abortion and the right to die with dignity. And I will defend those rights with all my strength.""  Watch: Singh post-debate scrum (in English)    Trudeau is a 'hypocrite': Scheer  Scheer landed a few punches of his own on Trudeau, saying the Liberal leader is a ""fraud"" on climate action because his party is the only one that is flying two gas-guzzling airplanes around the country as part of this election campaign.  The Liberal Party confirmed it has a second jet, saying it is used to ferry cargo and technical equipment from one destination to the next to give workers enough lead time to set up ahead of campaign events. A spokesperson said the party had the same arrangement in 2015.      Conservatives call Trudeau a 'hypocrite' for boasting environmental creds while flying 2 campaign planes     The Liberals said they have purchased carbon offset credits to cover greenhouse gas emissions generated from both planes and the campaign's ground transportation. The Conservative party has not.  Watch: Scheer calls Trudeau 'hypocrite' for 2 campaign planes    In a post-debate scrum, Scheer said the Conservative party will hold Trudeau to account for his ""hypocrisy,"" asking just how many ""props"" and ""costumes"" did Trudeau really need, a thinly veiled reference to Trudeau's 2018 India trip and to the recent blackface photos controversy.  ""It's always the same with this guy. He's always really quick at giving lessons, and lectures and sermons on how everyone else should live their lives and when it comes to his own personal behaviour he's a hypocrite,"" Scheer said.  SNC-Lavalin  SNC-Lavalin, the Quebec engineering firm that has been at the centre of political debate in Ottawa for the better part of a year, was invoked a number of times Wednesday night.  Blanchet attacked Scheer for his rhetoric during the political scandal and chastised him for not standing up for the company's Quebec workers. The Bloc leader has said thousands of jobs could be lost if the company is convicted on federal corruption charges related to its work in Libya. He said Ottawa should use all the powers at its disposal to protect Quebec companies and to keep the headquarters of major firms in the province.  Scheer said Trudeau — who was found by the ethics commissioner to have inappropriately pressured former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to sign a deferred prosecution agreement with SNC Lavalin — has undermined the independence of the country's judicial system.     An economic reality check on SNC-Lavalin: Are 9,000 jobs really at stake?    Trudeau defended his actions, saying he was only interested in protecting jobs in the province. Scheer said there is no evidence that any jobs would actually be lost if the company is eventually convicted.  The NDP leader rejected the jobs defence, saying Trudeau's handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair shows the Liberal party is beholden to corporate interests and the lobbyists that represent them.  In his closing remarks, Singh again tried to paint Trudeau as someone more attuned to the demands of the country's elite rather than the workers he claims to represent. Singh said Trudeau ""has surfed on his privilege all his life,"" whereas he, the son of working class immigrant parents, is ""a fighter, a real progressive.""  Bloc fights for relevance  Blanchet, a native Quebecer, and the leader with the best command of the French language, asked Quebecers to elect more MPs ""who resemble you. Who share your values. And who work for your interests, and only for the interests of Quebecers.""  Blanchet said the best way to ensure Quebec's voice is heard within Canada is to send more Bloc MPs to Ottawa, adding they would pressure the government of the day to send more shipbuilding work to Quebec's Davie yard.  He also said he'd force Ottawa to move to one tax return for Quebecers. Unlike other Canadians, Quebecers must file with both the province's tax collector and the Canada Revenue Agency.  He also said he wants to ensure the federal government doesn't intervene in a legal fight to end Quebec's secularism law, which forces public servants to remove religious garb while on the job.   ""I am going to Ottawa to defend the right of Quebec to function in its own way,"" Blanchet said. ""I don't want to send people to Ottawa who want to undo what we are doing in Quebec.""  Scheer tells Blanchet Quebec must elect Conservatives (Courtesy of TVA)    When Scheer said it was the Conservative Party that finally recognized Quebec as a ""nation within a united Canada,"" gave the province its own seat at United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and corrected a lingering fiscal imbalance, Blanchet said the Tories acted on these issues only after facing pressure from the Bloc.  Scheer spent much of the debate questioning the value of Bloc MPs.  He said, because they will never be able to form a government, a vote for the Bloc is a wasted vote because it will do nothing to get Trudeau out of office.  The Bloc has a lot of demands, ""but it's only us who can deliver them,"" Scheer said.  Watch: Blanchet post-debate scrum (in English)    The debate moderator, Pierre Bruneau, asked Blanchet to say how many laws Bloc MPs have passed over the last three decades.  Knowing the answer is zero, Blanchet said Bloc MPs have served other functions.  Trudeau said Quebecers are better represented when they have a seat at the table of government.

431,"'I am personally pro-life,' Scheer says, vowing not to re-open abortion debate","Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said today he is personally opposed to abortion — but a government led by him would not move to restrict access to the procedure.  Speaking to reporters in New Brunswick, Scheer, a practising Catholic, said that while he opposes abortion, a government led by him wouldn't enact any government legislation to ban the procedure or support the efforts of any Conservative backbench MP to limit the practice.  His declaration comes a day after three of the major party leaders pressured Scheer in a French election debate to say publicly how he feels personally about abortion. Scheer ducked the question last night, saying only that the abortion debate in Canada is settled.  ""My personal position has always been open and consistent. I am personally pro-life but I've also made the commitment that as leader of this party it is my responsibility to ensure that we do not re-open this debate, that we focus on issues that unite our party and unite Canadians,"" Scheer said Thursday at an announcement about tax credits for volunteer firefighters.  ""And that's exactly what I'll do and that's why I'll vote against measures that attempt to re-open this debate.""    Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau, who led the charge against Scheer's abortion stance in the debate, said today Scheer's reassurances aren't enough.  ""I'm going to fight for everyone, and I think women can see that. Andrew Scheer will not be there to defend their rights and that's very important. It's very important to understand the type of leadership that the various leaders have to offer,"" said Trudeau, campaigning today in Montreal.  When asked about a 2011 article that described Trudeau as a Catholic who ""is personally very opposed to abortion, but still believes nobody can tell a woman what she should do with her body,"" a Liberal Party spokesperson said Justin Trudeau is unquestionably ""pro-choice.""  NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Scheer should have come clean with voters when he had the chance on the debate stage.  ""The fact that he said it today but he didn't say it during the debate, when asked about it directly, shows a lack of courage,"" Singh said at a press conference in Toronto.  Scheer has a long history of social conservatism  Scheer has long identified as a social conservative. In 2005, he spoke out against same-sex marriage in a speech in the House of Commons.  While Scheer has so far refused to march in any of the country's pride parades, he said recently that the debate on same-sex marriage in Canada is settled.    Scheer also has said he supports equality among homosexual and heterosexual blood donors — current rules demand that men who have sex with men remain celibate for three months before they can donate.  The Conservative leader also has said he'd support a legislative ban on conversion therapy, a discredited pseudoscientific practice that attempts to turn gay people straight.  When running for the party's leadership in 2017, Scheer told the anti-abortion group RightNow that he would allow ""freedom of conscience"" for backbenchers.  ""I think that's one of the things that makes the Conservative Party stronger, that we allow for a diversity of views on these issues within our own caucus and we don't tell anyone that they have to park their conscience or their faith at the door,"" he said, according to a transcript of the interview.    In that interview, Scheer also said he has always voted in favour of ""pro-life"" legislation.  ""I can assure you that I support the right to individual MPs to speak out and bring, introduce matters that are important to them, but our party policy is clear on that and I think in order to maintain unity of our caucus it's important that the prime minister respects that,"" he said.  Scheer has said he would allow individual Conservative MPs to introduce legislation they want to pursue, while affirming that he, as leader, would vote against legislation that seeks to limit abortion access.",politics
432,2 PPC candidates tweet cartoon of Jagmeet Singh wearing turban with bomb on it,"A People's Party of Canada candidate in Saskatoon is coming under fire for sharing a cartoon photo on Twitter that depicts NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh wearing a turban with a bomb on it.   Mark Friesen, the PPC candidate for Saskatchewan's Saskatoon-Grasswood riding, said he didn't notice the explosive device when posting the illustration to his feed Tuesday.   ""I explained this to a few of the people that are calling me a racist now: I didn't realize there was a bomb in Singh's turban,"" Friesen said Thursday. ""If you just look at it, it just looks like a tuque, right?""   The cartoon features four major party leaders, with Singh alongside Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer and PPC Leader Maxime Bernier in a grassy field split with a line that demarks ""left"" and ""right.""  Trudeau is wearing a skirt and high heels, a Scheer speech balloon exclaims ""Max is splitting the vote!"" while Bernier, clad in lumberjack clothing, stands as the only candidate on the right, holding an axe.  On the far left, Singh is shown wearing a yellow turban with a black ball and a burning wick sticking out of it.     ""Here's a statement: This cartoon is obviously unacceptable,"" a spokesperson for the Singh campaign team said.  ""Of course it's racist,"" said Evan Balgord, the executive director of the Canadian Anti-Hate Network, which tracks the comments made online by groups including the PPC.   Social media users also responded to the post with alarm.    Fellow PPC candidate Rob Lussier, who is running in Manitoba's Brandon-Souris riding, retweeted the cartoon two weeks before, although he said he doesn't recall doing so now.  ""I don't remember the cartoon. I could have just shared it without even thinking about that,"" Lussier said. ""I'm usually quite attuned to that kind of thing because I'm a minority myself. Being a Métis and a gay person myself, I get a lot of hate and threats.""  Explaining his intention  Friesen, a retired corrections officer, said he didn't know who created the cartoon before he shared it.   ""I wasn't really giving it much thought,"" he said.   Friesen said he responded to the cartoon's larger message about the PPC being the only party on the right end of Canada's political spectrum.   Friesen said he's keeping the post on his Twitter feed because it stokes discussion on Singh's initial reluctance to denounce a Sikh separatist group responsible for the 1985 Air India bombing.      Jagmeet Singh now rejects glorification of Air India bombing mastermind     OPINION: Jagmeet Singh keeps getting asked about Sikh extremism because he won't give an answer     ""Let's have that discussion,"" Friesen said.    Balgord of the Canadian Anti-Hate Network said the cartoon appears to have first surfaced in a post on the ""metacanada"" Reddit thread in August 2018    ""It came out of and was trafficked by alt-right, neo-Nazi circles and did not originate with any commentary about [Air India] or anything of the sort that Friesen is using as his defence,"" Balgord said.   'Now that's disgusting'   Friesen's post came on Tuesday, a day before a video of a Montreal man telling Singh to take off his turban went viral.     ""Now that's disgusting,"" Friesen said of that encounter, adding that the incident won't prompt him to remove his post.  ""Two completely different situations.""  Singh is scheduled to make an appearance in Saskatoon Friday.  It's not the first time a Saskatchewan PPC candidate has come under scrutiny for remarks made on social media in recent months.   ""Our country could use more hate speech, more offensive comments, more 'micro-aggressions', more violation of safe spaces with words and more critical thinking,"" Carlton Trail-Eagle Creek candidate Cody Payant wrote on his Facebook page and Twitter account on July 16.        People's Party of Canada candidate in Sask. slammed over call for more 'hate speech'     Bernier defended Payant and said he would not be removed as a candidate, adding that he felt Payant had been quoted out of context during media coverage of the post.   Bernier's campaign office did not respond to requests for comment about Friesen's post Thursday. ",politics
433,Did the Bloc Québécois really kill the Energy East pipeline? ,"The Claim: ""If it wasn't for the Bloc Québécois, there would be a pipeline crossing Quebec. It was the Bloc Québécois who stood in the way of that.""  -- Bloc leader Yves-François Blanchet claims sole credit for killing the Energy East pipeline during Wednesday night's French-language debate.   The Facts: TransCanada formally announced its intention to seek approval for a 4,500 km pipeline to carry crude oil from Alberta and Saskatchewan to refineries in Eastern Canada in the summer of 2013.  The project would have seen 3,000 km of existing natural gas pipeline converted to handle oil, as well as the construction of 1,500 km of new pipeline in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario, Québec and New Brunswick. The initial price tag was estimated to be $12 billion, but by the time the company officially withdrew its application in October 2017, the cost had ballooned to $15.7 billion.  The idea of transporting 1.1 million barrels of oil eastward every day was controversial from the get go and there was strenuous opposition from both environmentalists and communities along the pipeline's proposed path.   For example, a coalition of environmental groups, including The Council of Canadians and Quebec's Equiterre, issued a report in March 2014, questioning TransCanada's claims of ""massive"" economic benefits that would be reaped from the pipeline. It noted that the country's East Coast refineries had little excess capacity and that most of the crude would end up being exported overseas.   And in September 2014, four different environmental organizations won a temporary injunction to stop preparatory work along the Saint Lawrence River on the grounds that the project might threaten nursing grounds for beluga whales.     The Bloc Québécois rarely raised questions about the pipeline until Gilles Duceppe returned as leader in the summer of 2015, and began to attack the NDP's Tom Mulcair for his maybe-yes, maybe-no stance on the project.   And to say that the Bloc's opposition was solely — or even largely — responsible for the cancellation of Energy East is a stretch.  By the time Duceppe made it a focal point of his 2015 election campaign, hundreds of thousands of people across the country had already signed petitions against the pipeline, attended protests, or applied to have their voices heard at approval hearings.   And soon after taking office, Justin Trudeau's new Liberal government changed the National Energy Board's (NEB) pipeline approval process so that greenhouse gas emissions had to be taken into account.     But the single-biggest blow to the already unpopular pipeline's fortunes in Quebec might have been revelations in the summer of 2016, that three members of the NEB had discussed the project with former premier Quebec Jean Charest while he was acting as a consultant to TransCanada.   The unpublicized meeting, first reported by the Vancouver-based National Observer, sparked outrage across the province and, that August, two days of public hearings in Montreal had to be cancelled after violent protests. All future meetings were suspended pending an administrative review, and in early September, the NEB members who had met Charest stepped down over the perceived conflict of interest.  When a new review panel was struck in early 2017, its first order of business was to toss out all the decisions that had been made by the previous NEB reviewers, effectively restarting the approval process from scratch.  TransCanada threw in the towel on the project on Oct. 5, 2017 citing ""changed circumstances,"" not the least of which was the slumping price of oil — down almost $40 a barrel from when the pipeline was first proposed.   The Verdict: False. The Bloc Québécois' opposition to the Energy East pipeline was not a major factor in its cancellation.

434,Scheer says he'd seek 'judicial review' of First Nation child welfare compensation,"Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer today called for a ""judicial review"" of a Canadian Human Rights Tribunal decision to compensate First Nations children harmed by the on-reserve child welfare system.  The tribunal ordered the federal government on Sept. 6 to pay $40,000 — the maximum allowed under the Canadian Human Rights Act — to each child apprehended from homes and communities under the on-reserve child welfare system.  The ruling also directed Ottawa to compensate some of the parents and grandparents of children who were apprehended.  Scheer said the decision could leave the federal government on the hook for billions of dollars in compensation.  ""This is a far-reaching decision that has major impacts on multiple levels of government,"" Scheer said.  ""It would be appropriate to have a judicial review.""     Ottawa ordered to compensate First Nations children impacted by on-reserve child welfare system    Trudeau ducks question on whether he'd accept First Nations child welfare compensation ruling     A party spokesman later clarified Scheer's statement by saying the Conservative leader would appeal the decision if he were prime minister right now. The deadline for the federal government to appeal is Monday — two weeks before election day.  Scheer has not said specifically what a Conservative government would do with this file if it forms government after Oct. 21.  Scheer urged to reconsider  ""It has a chilling effect when a leader of any party makes a comment such as this,"" said Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond, a lawyer and former child and youth advocate for British Columbia, in reaction to Scheer.  ""We're dealing with a very traumatized group of young Canadians who are seeking support ... So making off-the-cuff comments about their rights and their situation can be very harmful.""  Turpel-Lafond is urging Scheer to speak to experts in the Indigenous child welfare field carefully and reconsider his position.   Cindy Blackstock, executive director of the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society, called Scheer's remarks ""disappointing"" and said she's also unimpressed with the Liberal government.  Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau did not give a direct answer on Thursday when asked what a re-elected Liberal government would do.  Will move forward, says Trudeau  ""From the Sixties Scoop to the relocations, to the tuberculosis among the Inuit, we have always moved forward in a responsible way to compensate, to support people, and we will continue to do that as we move forward,"" Trudeau said.  ""We're going to continue to work with Indigenous communities, work with Indigenous leaders, to make sure that there is proper compensation.""    Indigenous Services Minister Seamus O'Regan said shortly after the decision came down that his department would need to review it before deciding what to do next.  Blackstock, who is at the forefront of the drive to end discrimination against First Nation children, said an appeal of the decision would perpetuate ""racial discrimination of the worst kind.""  ""It is the federal government's discriminatory conduct that needs review and reform — not the legal decision that flagged the problem and ordered the discrimination to stop,"" she said.  NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and Green Party Leader Elizabeth May have both said they would offer compensation at the level ordered by the tribunal.    ""Every party leader must commit to honouring this ruling made by Canada's own human rights tribunal,"" Perry Bellegarde, National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations, wrote in a tweet.  ""This is about supporting First Nations children and families and respecting human rights. It is unconscionable that anyone would oppose this.""  The ruling covers all children in the care of the on-reserve child welfare system at any point from Jan.1, 2006, to a date to be determined by the tribunal.  Some estimates place the number of potentially affected children at about 50,000, with the largest numbers in the Prairies and British Columbia. The ruling also covers First Nation children in the Yukon territory.  Ballot box issue  Turpel-Lafond said she wants whichever party that forms the next government to work out a new path for First Nation children and families.  ""The recognition that they deserve respect and support is long overdue,"" Turpel-Laford said.  ""The time for fighting First Nation children and families is over.""  The tribunal ordered Ottawa to enter discussions with the First Nations Family Caring Society and the Assembly of First Nations — which filed the initial human rights complaint in 2007 — to determine the best independent process to distribute the compensation and decide who qualifies.  It gave the parties until Dec. 10 to come to the tribunal with proposals.  Blackstock said voters should consider where all political parties stand on the ruling when they head to the ballot box, and decide whether they want a government that supports compensating First Nation children or continuing the litigation against them.  ""I find Canadians really are wanting to see First Nation children being treated fairly and justly,"" Blackstock said.  ""I think they're way out in front of the political parties in many ways on this.""",politics
435,Manning Centre a primary backer for series of anti-Liberal Facebook pages,"The Manning Centre is a driving financial force behind a network of anti-Liberal Facebook pages pumping out political messaging and memes during the federal election campaign.  The Calgary-based organization, launched in 2005 by Reform Party founder Preston Manning, gave a total of $312,450 to a network of related third-party advertising groups that operate on Facebook and Instagram.  In most cases, the centre was the sole donor listed by those groups in disclosure forms filed with Elections Canada.  The bulk of the Manning Centre's contributions — $240,500 — went to Canada Strong and Proud, the network's national politics-focused page.  That page is affiliated with a series of provincial pages, including New Brunswick Proud, Nova Scotia Proud, NL Strong and Quebec Fier — all of which got Manning Centre funding.  Alberta Proud, BC Strong and Ontario Strong are also part of the family of organizations. The various groups often post and share similar contents and ads.    Confusingly, those groups have no affiliation with Ontario Proud, Canada Proud or B.C. Proud, which are similar but separate anti-Liberal groups set up and run by Jeff Ballingall, a former Conservative political staffer and media figure.  Several of the provincially focused groups have conducted robocall and mass automated text campaigns over the past two years, including the ""Sue From Ontario Strong"" text campaign from June.  And since late July, Canada Strong and Proud has spent more than $103,000 on Facebook ads, with most of that spending happening before the election campaign began formally on Sept. 11. It reported just $7,441 in campaign-period expenses in its recent disclosure to Elections Canada, with the provincial affiliates also spending up to a few thousand dollars each.  Think tank is 'balancing that message out'  This is the first time Canada Strong and Proud and most of its sister organizations have been required to publish details of their financial backing.  Requests for comment sent to several of the groups were not returned.  Troy Lanigan, president of the Manning Centre, said in an interview Wednesday he was thrilled his organization had the resources to help broadcast a stronger conservative message during the campaign.    Lanigan said the balance in third-party advertising between centre-left and centre-right groups traditionally has been heavily weighted to the former's advantage. Labour unions and environmentalist groups combined are strongly outspending centre-right advocacy groups in this election as well.  Lanigan said part of the Manning Centre's goal for the funding, as a group that supports conservatives, was ""balancing that message out.""    ""The ratios will still be big, I think you will see centre-left groups in the country still vastly outspend centre-right groups in third-party advertising. But what's really encouraging is, I think, centre-right groups are fighting back, they're not just lying down,"" Lanigan said.  Pro-oil sector videos released  Canada Strong and Proud's first big chunk of spending was on a video encouraging Canadians to be proud of the oil-and-gas sector in the country, though it has recently switched to a more narrow, personalized critique of Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau during the formal campaign period.  ""Obviously as a western-based organization, I think some of the pro-energy messages resonate with Manning [Centre] supporters,"" Lanigan said.  He added the centre had chosen to support the linked Proud groups because of their reach and past success in gaining national attention.    ""These are groups that were on the radar, and had our attention, and were looking for support,"" he said. But the Manning Centre was not looking to micromanage their message, Lanigan added.  The Manning Centre previously supported the network's New Brunswick branch with a $7,000 donation during the 2018 provincial election there.  Canada Strong and Proud and its affiliated groups are among a host of digital advocacy groups that have embraced a new, meme-driven type of political action during this election period, creating messages for others to spread.  Lanigan said he wanted to take advantage of clever advocacy and groups that have been ""smart with limited resources.""  He said it came back to the imbalance in spending between groups like Unifor — which has spent around $1.3 million so far this election — and right-leaning groups like his own.  ""We'll be outgunned, we'll be out-resourced, but we're not lying down. And that's been a huge sea-change from what it was in 2015.""",politics

Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau's turn in the hot seat came Monday and Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer had his turn Tuesday.  One of the undecided voters who spoke to May — Danny Ottenbreit, a 35-year-old farmer in Saskatchewan with a wife and a toddler — said he has concerns about how international trading relationships have hurt Canadian farmers.

Each voter is undecided, but open to voting for the leader they are across from and looking for the answers they need for a question that relates to their lives.  We invited leaders who are running national campaigns. We provided a date range in order to have them all recorded and aired in the span of one week. Mr. Bernier initially declined our offer to participate due to scheduling issues and we have since invited him for an interview later in the campaign.  Mr. Blanchet was not invited as the Bloc Quebecois is only running candidates in one province.",politics
437,Conservatives call Trudeau a 'hypocrite' for boasting of environmental creds while flying 2 campaign planes,"The Conservatives are calling Justin Trudeau a ""carbon hypocrite"" for flying two planes during the 40-day election campaign, emitting double the carbon emissions of other campaigns.  The Conservatives issued a news release — including travel logs and photographs of the two planes — during the French language debate hosted by TVA.  ""Despite marching in climate strikes, lecturing everybody else on lowering emissions and imposing a carbon tax on hard-working Canadians, Justin Trudeau and the Liberals are secretly using two aircraft to campaign in this election,"" the release says.  The Liberals issued their own release in response, accusing Scheer of being ""desperate to deflect from the fact that Conservatives have no plan for the environment.""    In a news conference after the Montreal debate, Trudeau confirmed the Liberal Party is using a cargo plane as well as a regular plane, as it did in the 2015 campaign.  ""It allows us to do more events in more parts of the country and meet more Canadians,"" he said. ""It's an important part of our national campaign to meet as many people as possible.""  Carbon offsets  Trudeau said the Liberals will purchase carbon offsets for all of the campaign transportation on planes and buses.  ""I will highlight that Andrew Scheer and his Conservatives did not purchase carbon offsets for their transportation because they think pollution should be free,"" he said.    Scheer said he couldn't understand why the Liberals needed two planes, since the single Conservative aircraft has ample space for luggage and equipment.  ""I don't know what types of props or costumes or camping equipment he's bringing along, but he's made his choice. If he thinks it's okay to emit far more emissions than our campaign is emitting, we're going to hold him to account for his hypocrisy,"" he said.  Watch: Andrew Scheer calls Justin Trudeau a 'hypocrite' for having 2 campaign planes; Trudeau points to carbon offsets    ""It's always the same with this guy. He's always very quick at giving lessons and lectures and sermons about how everyone else should live their lives, but when it comes to his own personal behaviour, he's a complete hypocrite.""  A Conservative party spokesman, Simon Jefferies, said in an email to CBC News the Conservatives are not purchasing carbon offsets for their plane.",politics
438,"As they approach the ballot box, Canada's veterans are urged to read the fine political print","Canada's veterans, many of whom shifted their support in 2015 from the Conservatives to the Liberals, are being encouraged during this election campaign to take a closer, more critical look at the details of the parties' election pitches.  Advocates who represent them say veterans have learned the value of the old maxim: Read the fine print.  The Liberal pledge in 2015 to give veterans the ""option"" of a lifetime pension for injuries sustained in the line of duty was a key element of the party's efforts to capture their votes, the advocates say.  Rightly or wrongly, that promise left many former soldiers with the impression that there would be a wholesale return to pensions-for-life — and those allowances would be equal to what was paid out under the old Pension Act.  Since then, there has been an extraordinary and divisive debate about the Liberal government's pension-for-life plan, implemented last spring. Among the skeptics is the Parliamentary Budget Office, which said the program will be slightly more generous than the one it replaces, but not a match for the pre-2006 system.  That's why the details are so important to veterans now, said veterans advocate Aaron Bedard.    ""There were just some fine details that people were willing to overlook [in 2015] for the sake of change,"" said Bedard, who was at the heart of a now-defunct class lawsuit over the disability pension system.  Bedard said that, in 2015, there was ""nowhere else"" for veterans disillusioned by the Conservatives to turn, apart from the Liberal Party.  The NDP and the Green Party will no doubt take umbrage at that claim, but Bedard said that, in the four years since, those parties haven't spent much time meeting with his group of former soldiers and advocates to understand their concerns.  However, the NDP, the People's Party of Canada and the Green Party seem to be the ones most interested in upending the status quo on veterans. All thee parties are calling for a review of veterans' services and benefits.  The Green Party platform specifically proposes ""a national re-examination of veterans' issues"" as well as a restoration of the pre-2006 benefit payment regime.  The People's Party of Canada proposes a ""line-by-line review"" of the existing veterans charter. It is also pitching a wholesale return to the previous pension-for-life system.  Conservatives promise changes  The Conservative platform, meanwhile, promises to create ""a reliable, dependable pension system"" that is fair to the most disabled veterans.  Defining ""fair"" should be a simple task, said one advocate.  Brian Forbes, chair of the National Council of Veterans Associations, said the disparity between the benefits paid to older and younger veterans is a key ballot box issue for his community.  ""What we are looking for from these political parties is for someone to stand up and say, 'Look, we should not have two or three layers of pension benefits,'"" said Forbes. ""We should have one model for all disabled veterans.""  Forbes pointed to the cases of two former soldiers, both double amputees — one wounded before the 2006 introduction of the New Veterans Charter (NVC) and one injured afterward. He said their compensation packages do ""not resemble one another.""    And many veterans still feel lingering resentment over Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's comment during a 2017 town hall. Defending his government's handling of the class-action lawsuit by veterans, Trudeau said former soldiers were ""asking for more than we are able to give right now.""  ""The outrage from that comment is still palpable,"" said Forbes. ""There are veterans who've never forgotten that exchange.""  For their part, the Liberals say they want to move beyond the pension-for-life debate and focus on wellness and care. They're proposing swifter and broader access to mental health services.  The party promises that each veteran would be eligible for $3,000 in free counselling services before they file a disability claim under a re-elected Liberal government.    The Liberals also say they would also simplify and shorten the benefits process to include ""automatic approval for the most common disability applications, including depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and arthritis, among others.""  Guy Gallant, a spokesman for the Liberals, said medical conditions that already have high approval rates (80 per cent or more) would be eligible for fast-track approval of benefits.  The Parliamentary Budget Office, in its recent analysis, warned that ""the perception of automatic approval may increase take-up or application rates"" for those programs. That could lead to bigger budgets for those programs.  The Liberal government appears to have laid the groundwork already by redesigning the post-traumatic stress disorder questionnaire filled out by medical professionals.  As CBC News reported last spring, the new form is shorter and more general, which troubles some psychologists. The  new, more generic application gives the bureaucracy more latitude to reject or approve the claim; when the new form was introduced, officials insisted they wanted to see swifter endorsements.    As of last November, the backlog of disability applications had grown to 40,000 — something both the New Democrats and Conservatives vow to fix. The Tories commit to doing it within 24 months.  The Liberals have acknowledged the problem, but defend their record.  ""We have worked hard to ensure veterans and their families get the services they need and benefits they deserve,"" said Gallant.  The Liberals also promise to ""move forward with a new rapid-response service staffed by social workers, case management counsellors and peer support workers.""  They say their mission would be to ""proactively reach out to every Canadian veteran to make sure that they know about the help that is available, and how to access it.""  The party is vague on what that policy would entail. ""This will likely involve the hiring of several hundred social workers, case management counsellors and peer support workers,"" said Gallant.  Promise more housing  There is a separate Liberal proposal for ""building new, purpose-built accessible and affordable housing units, with a full range of health, social and employment support for veterans who need extra help.""  It would be a $15 million per year commitment.  Jim Lowther is president of VETS Canada, an organization that works to get homeless veterans off the streets. He said he is intrigued but added the Liberals will have to realize that they cannot create ""barracks-style"" housing for former soldiers.  ""As long as it is community housing,"" he said. ""One of the things we've learned over the years is that veterans don't want to live together. A lot of veterans who are homeless have been out for 10 years and don't ... want to go back to a barracks setting.""  Lowther said he believes a stipend to help veterans having trouble paying rent might be just as effective as investing in bricks and mortar. It would, he said, prevent veterans from becoming homeless in the first place.  No matter which party is elected, Lowther said, the next government is going to have to wrap its head around a different definition of veteran homelessness.  Work on homelessness  ""People think of a guy holding a cup. That's not what it is like,"" he said. ""That might be one per cent of what it actually is. Most [homeless] veterans are couch surfing and doing other things.""  It has been tough, many veterans advocates say, to get all the parties to make the kind of sophisticated distinctions that Lowther talks about.  Which is why Forbes argues that, as veterans are making up their minds in the current election campaign, they should be asking all parties the same question: ""What do you mean when you say you were going to take care of us?""",politics
439,"Alberta Energy Regulator wrongfully used $5.4M in public money to create international centre, probes find","Alberta's energy regulator wrongfully used its own resources to establish an international centre outside its mandate — at a loss of $2.3 million — with the agency's former chief executive displaying ""reckless and wilful disregard""  for the proper management of public fund.  Those are among the key findings of three provincial probes into the Alberta Energy Regulator's decision to create and operate the now-defunct International Centre for Regulatory Excellence, or ICORE, in 2017.  The AER, which is funded by a levy charged to the energy sector, oversees the province's massive energy sector and is expected to ensure the safe and environmentally responsible development of the industry.   The provincial auditor general and the public interest commissioner both began looking into ICORE last year after concerns were raised about the relationship between it and the Alberta Energy Regulator. The Office of the Ethics Commissioner also conducted its own investigation.  ICORE was established as a separate, external entity that would offer training to regulators around the world. It was launched during a ceremony in Mexico City in 2017.  In results released Friday, both the auditor general and public interest commissioner reports found this was outside the AER's mandate and that public money was spent inappropriately on ICORE activities.  'Gross mismanagement' by former president, probe finds  But the Office of the Public Interest Commissioner levelled some of its strongest criticism at Jim Ellis, who was president of the AER and ICORE.  ""The wrongdoing occurred under the authority of the former AER president and chief executive officer Jim Ellis,"" says the report from the Office of the Public Interest Commissioner.  ""His actions demonstrated a reckless and wilful disregard for the proper management of public funds, public assets and the delivery of a public service, which … constitutes gross mismanagement.""  The ethics commissioner also found that Ellis had a conflict of interest ""in that he furthered his own interest and improperly furthered the private interest of three other employees,"" its report says.  ""The primary motivation behind ICORE not-for-profit was to provide future employment for Mr. Ellis and others.""  AER still out of pocket $2.3M, AG says  Alberta's auditor general also concluded that ICORE activities lacked a credible benefit to the AER.  Auditor General Doug Wylie's report estimated that the total financial impact of ICORE activities on the AER totalled $5.4 million, of which $3.1 million was recouped. The AER is still out of pocket $2.3 million, however, according to the audit.  ""AER engaged in activities outside of its mandate and public money was spent inappropriately on ICORE activities,"" the report from the auditor general found.  The audit also found that controls and processes to protect against potential conflicts of interest failed and that oversight from the AER's board was ineffective.  ""Controls to track and monitor expenses related to ICORE activities were at first non-existent and then poorly implemented,"" the report stated.  ""The tone at the top at AER did not support a strong control environment or compliance with policies.""  AER sued ICORE in 2019  A CBC News investigation this summer found a close and complicated relationship between the AER and ICORE, including the involvement of Ellis.  Several key figures, including Ellis, who were involved with ICORE are no longer associated with either organization.  Earlier in 2019, the AER sued ICORE — the organization it had created — for $2.6 million, saying it was owed the money for the development and delivery of training materials.   The AER received a default judgment in its favour in the spring. ICORE never filed a statement of defence. The regulator reported that it collected from ICORE the full amount awarded by the court.    The results of the provincial investigations come at a time when the energy regulator is under scrutiny from the provincial government.  In September, Energy Minister Sonya Savage announced her department was launching a review of the AER and appointed an interim board of directors to set its future direction.  Savage said at that time that recent months have brought questions about ""operational efficiencies, executive oversight and budgetary spending practices"" at the regulator.  More to come  ",business
440,"Legalized cannabis hasn't hurt productivity, but most employers don't allow it at work, survey suggests","Legal recreational cannabis hasn't had the negative effect on workplace productivity that some Canadians expected, but that could be because most of us work for organizations that don't allow it at work, a new online survey suggests.  Conducted by Ipsos on behalf of ADP Canada, a human resources software company, the survey suggests that most Canadians believe recreational cannabis has had little to no impact at work.  For example, 74 per cent said it's had no impact on productivity, and 71 per cent said it hadn't increased absenteeism.  Asked the same questions prior to legalization on Oct. 17, 2018, 46 per cent of respondents felt productivity would decline and 40 per cent expected absenteeism to rise.  For these new findings, researchers surveyed 1,160 working Canadians 18 years and older between Aug. 30 and Sept. 18. The results were weighted to reflect a representative sampling of working Canadians. A randomized sample of this size would yield a margin of error of +u002F- 3.3 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.  ""The expectation was that there would be a huge impact on the workplace, and yet the data shows this time around that it's much, much smaller than we anticipated,"" said Hendrik Steenkamp, HR advisory director for ADP Canada.  ""I think that Canadians are very good, law-abiding citizens, and I think they have respect for the workplace.""    The survey also found that 86 per cent of respondents say their employers do not permit recreational cannabis use at work.  Just eight per cent said their employers allow recreational marijuana use during the workday, and seven per cent said they didn't know.  Employers' fears didn't materialize  Of those who actually partake of the drug, five per cent said they've used cannabis recreationally before work, four per cent during work and six per cent with colleagues after work.  Steenkamp said that in most cases, employers have likely updated their existing substance use policies to include recreational cannabis and to put an emphasis on impairment.  ""If, for argument's sake, you're not allowed to use alcohol during your workday, or come to work impaired, then the same would apply to cannabis,"" he said.    Employment lawyer Nadia Halum Arauz of MacLeod Law Firm in Toronto said that prior to legalization, the employers she works with were expecting the worst.    ""To them, the sky was falling,"" she said.  ""The reality is, I think, a lot people consumed cannabis regularly already, and so legalization probably didn't have too much of an impact on their current practices. It makes sense to me that the impact hasn't been high as people were fearing it to be.""  In some industries, restricting pot use outside work justified  Daniel Walker, head of the Cannabis Law Group, a subsidiary of Bobilaw Walker Law in Toronto, said he was surprised the survey found such a high level of restriction around cannabis use at work and questioned whether Canadians are well informed about their employers' cannabis policies.  ""What would be more useful is to do the same survey with HR departments,"" he said.  ""If the result is the same and they're not safety-related companies, that would be shocking because it would have a lot of legal implications.""  Where safety to workers or the public is concerned, employers have grounds for restricting substance use outside of work hours, he said.   Airline pilots and crane operators are two examples where employers can reasonably ask that workers refrain from consuming drugs or alcohol either altogether or within 12 hours of a shift, said Walker.   (Air Canada, WestJet and Jazz have put blanket bans on cannabis use for employees directly involved in flight operation, including pilots, flight attendants and mechanics.)    But employers would have trouble justifying prohibiting cannabis use outside of work time where these risks aren't present, Walker said.  ""Constitutionally, and from a human rights perspective, if these policies do exist for sectors that are not safety related, they are unconstitutional, and they would be challenged.""  Halum Arauz also said she'd be surprised if employers would endeavour to restrict cannabis use outside of work hours.  ""I would bring up the example of wine and beer,"" she said. ""You have to give people a little bit more credit. Just because it's being legalized doesn't mean people are going to consume at the workplace.""  ADP's Steenkamp also pointed out the survey found a discrepancy between how managers and their staff understood cannabis policies at work, with managers being 12 per cent more likely to have a clear understanding.    ""Organizations need to be very clear on what are the expectations to both leadership teams and employees when it comes to substance abuse in the workplace,"" he said. ""If they haven't put those policies in place or amended their existing policies, it's not too late to do that.""   Steenkamp said this will only become more critical as more forms of cannabis, including edibles, become legal in the coming months.",business
441,"U.S. jobless rate falls to record low of 3.5% as 135,000 jobs added last month","U.S. employers added a modest 136,000 jobs in September, enough to help lower the unemployment rate to a new five-decade low of 3.5 per cent.  The figures show that hiring has slowed this year as the U.S.-China trade war has intensified, global growth has slowed and businesses have reduced their investment spending. Even so, recent job gains have averaged 157,000 over the past three months, enough to absorb new job seekers and potentially lower unemployment over time.  Besides issuing the jobs data for September, the government on Friday also revised up its earlier estimates of the gains for July and August by a combined 45,000. The steadiness of U.S. hiring, despite its slowing pace, may help ease concerns that the economy might be edging closer to a potential recession.  Wages slip  Despite ultra-low unemployment, which fell from 3.7 per cent in August, average hourly wages slipped by a penny, the Labor Department said Friday in its monthly jobs report. Hourly pay rose just 2.9 per cent from a year earlier, below the 3.4 per cent year-over-year gain at the start of the year.  All told, the September jobs report is likely to keep the Federal Reserve on track to cut rates later this month for the third time this year to try to help sustain the expansion.  The weakening pace of hiring suggests that many employers are growing cautious in the face of uncertainties from President Donald Trump's trade wars and a global economic slowdown. Businesses have added an average of just 119,000 jobs a month for the past three months, the smallest three-month gain in seven years.  The weakest sector of the economy — manufacturing, which is likely already in recession — cut 2,000 jobs in September. At the same time, retailers shed 11,400 jobs, and employment in mining and logging was unchanged.  The big gains last month were in health care, which added 41,400 jobs, and professional and business services, which includes higher-paying positions such as engineering and accounting. That sector added 34,000 positions.  Friday's jobs data underscored the benefits of a hot job market for lower-paid Americans and traditionally disadvantaged workers. The unemployment rate for workers without high school diplomas fell to 4.8 per cent, the lowest level on records dating to 1992. The rate for Latinos fell to 3.9 per cent, also a record low.  With the U.S. economic expansion in its 11th year and unemployment low, many businesses have struggled to find the workers they need. That is another reason why hiring has slowed since last year, when job growth averaged 223,000 a month.  The employment figures carry more weight than usual because worries about the health of the economy are mounting. Manufacturers are struggling as businesses have cut spending on industrial machinery, computers and other factory goods. And overseas demand for U.S. exports has fallen sharply as Trump's trade conflicts with China and Europe have triggered retaliatory tariffs.  A measure of factory activity fell in September to its lowest level in more than a decade. And new orders for manufactured items slipped last month, the government reported.  Persistent uncertainties about the economy are also affecting hotels, restaurants and other service industries. A trade group's measure of growth in the economy's vast services sector slowed sharply in September to its lowest point in three years, suggesting that the trade conflicts and rising uncertainty are weakening the bulk of the economy.  The job market is the economy's main bulwark. As long as hiring is solid enough to keep the unemployment rate from rising, most Americans will likely remain confident enough to spend, offsetting other drags and propelling the economy forward.  But a slump in hiring or a rise in the unemployment rate in coming months could discourage consumers from spending as freely as they otherwise might during the holiday shopping season.  Consumers are still mostly optimistic, and their spending has kept the economy afloat this year. But they may be growing more cautious. Consumer confidence dropped sharply in September, according to the Conference Board, a business research group, although it remains at a high level.  Americans also reined in their spending in August after several months of healthy gains. The 0.1 per cent increase in consumer spending that month was the weakest in six months.  Other parts of the U.S. economy are still holding up well. Home sales, for example, have rebounded as mortgage rates have fallen, helped in part by the Fed's two interest rate cuts this year. Sales of existing homes reached their highest level in nearly 18 months in August. And new home sales soared.  Americans are also buying cars at a still-healthy pace. Consumers would typically be reluctant to make such major purchases if they were fearful of a downturn.",business
442,Trade deficit narrowed to $955M in August as Canada sold more oil and jets,"The gap between what Canada buys from the rest of the world and what it sells narrowed to just under $1 billion in August, as higher exports of energy and aircraft drove exports to more than $50 billion.  Statistics Canada reported Friday that Canada's merchandise trade deficit narrowed to $955 million in August, down from $1.4 billion the previous month as exports rose by 1.8 per cent while imports only increased by 1 per cent.  Canada exported just shy of $50.6 billion during the month. That's the fifth highest monthly total ever, which was set in May when the country saw a surge in car and car part exports.  So far in 2019, total exports are on track to be 2.4 per cent higher than they were last year.  Exports of energy products led the way, with crude oil up 2.9 per cent after two straight monthly declines. Exports of nuclear fuel more than doubled during the month, while refined petroleum products increased by 13 per cent from July's level.  Aircraft exports also surged, up 38.7 per cent mainly because of a flurry of business jet sales to the U.S.  While they were a source of strength earlier in the year, exports of cars and car parts declined by 2.3 per cent. Car and truck exports were lower ""as a result of prolonged summer shutdowns at certain assembly plants,"" the data agency said.  Imports rose too  On the other side of the ledger, Canada imported $51.5 billion during the month, up 1 per cent. Imports of gold rose to their highest level in two years, and energy exports also surged 9.7 per cent as a result of higher imports of crude oil because of shutdowns on offshore oil platforms.  While Canada has a trade deficit with the rest of the world, the country's trade surplus with the U.S. got even wider during the month. Exports to the United States rose 3.1 per cent in August, while imports were up 1.8 per cent, pushing the trade gap to just shy of $5 billion on the merchandise. The merchandise trade balance doesn't include trade in services, however — just goods and raw materials",business
443,"WestJet, Sunwing Vacations and Transat inspect Boeing aircraft for cracks after FAA directive ","WestJet Airlines, Sunwing Vacations Inc. and Transat A.T. said Thursday they were examining their fleets of Boeing 737 Next Generation aircraft for cracks after a U.S. regulator ordered the inspections.  The Calgary-based airline, WestJet says it has 43 aircraft that fall under an inspection directive issued by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.  The company says it has had no structural cracks in its 737 NG fleet and expects minimal disruptions from the inspections.  Sunwing Vacations Inc. said it had received the directive from the FAA and will be inspecting its fleet as appropriate, but didn't expect any disruptions to its schedule.  The company did not say how many of its planes require inspection, but it has more than 40 of the Boeing 737 NG aircraft in its fleet.    Air Transat said it has five 737 NG planes in its fleet plus a temporary one. It said two of its planes would require a visual inspection that would take about an hour, but none of its planes have flown enough to require a more extensive check.  Air Canada says it does not have any of the Boeing 737 NG planes.  The FAA said that if the cracking was not addressed it could lead to a loss of control of the airplane.  The inspection order comes as Boeing remains under scrutiny after two deadly crashes led to a grounding of its Boeing 737 Max aircraft in March.  The crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia killed a total of 346 people on board, including 18 Canadians.  WestJet announced in September that it was removing 737 Max jets from its holiday schedule while Air Canada warned the impact of the grounded jet on its operations may ripple well into 2021.  Sunwing said in August that its four Max aircraft will be absent from the rotation until mid-May, with some 3,000 flights having been affected over the summer alone.",business
444,Auditor general to release results of probe into energy regulator's international work,"Following months of investigation, the results of twin probes into a decision by Alberta's energy watchdog to set up an international, not-for-profit institute are to be released Friday.  The provincial Auditor General and Public Interest Commissioner both began looking into the International Centre of Regulatory Excellence (ICORE) late last year after concerns were raised about the relationship between it and the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER).  Their findings will be detailed in a joint news conference in Edmonton.  ICORE was established two years ago as a separate entity that would offer training to regulators around the world.  But its operation has led to questions about the direction and priorities at the AER, which has been a target of criticism for executive travel, how long it takes to approve oil and gas projects and the rising cost of abandoned energy infrastructure, like old oil wells, in Alberta.     Alberta government launches review of energy regulator   Oilpatch in 'crisis' as energy regulator executives travelled the world launching a side project called ICORE    The AER, which is funded by a levy charged to the energy sector, oversees the province's massive energy sector and is expected to ensure the safe and environmentally responsible development of the industry.    A spokeswoman for the Public Interest Commissioner's office told CBC News this summer that its investigation would be ""thorough"" and focus on ""allegations of gross mismanagement relating to the use of public funds, public assets and AER human resources to establish and support the operation of ICORE.""  The Auditor General's office has also confirmed it was looking into the relationship between ICORE and the AER. The job of the auditor general is to examine and report publicly on the government's management of public resources.  When Alberta's then-NDP government learned of the concerns, it suspended all ICORE-related activities.   A CBC News investigation this summer found a close and complicated relationship between the AER and ICORE, including the involvement of Jim Ellis, who was the president of both organizations.  Several key figures, including Ellis, who were involved with ICORE are no longer associated with either organization.    Documents obtained by CBC News show about a dozen AER employees were assigned away from their regular duties to do work for ICORE. Some of that work included training people in Mexico on ICORE's behalf.  One former employee, who told CBC News he'd spoken with provincial investigators, said he had raised questions internally about the goals of the venture and whether there was really a public benefit.     Alberta Energy Regulator spent more than $14,000 flying boss to weekly meetings   Alberta auditor probing relationship between energy regulator and not-for-profit centre    Earlier this year, the AER sued ICORE — the organization it had created — for $2.6 million, saying it was owed the money for the development and delivery of training materials.

445,Constellation Brands books loss on stake in cannabis company Canopy Growth,"Alcohol giant Constellation Brands Inc.'s latest quarterly results were weighed down by millions in losses and a writedown in connection with its significant stake in Canadian cannabis producer Canopy Growth Corp., but it still beat market expectations.  The U.S.-based producer of Corona beer reported a loss per share of $2.77 or earnings of $2.72 on an adjusted basis for what was the second quarter of its 2020 financial year, surpassing the $2.60 in earnings expected by analysts, according to the financial markets data firm Refinitiv.  Constellation, which is Canopy's largest shareholder, said that excluding the pot producer's equity losses it earned $2.91 per share on a comparable basis.  Constellation also said it recognized a total loss of $484.4 million in the quarter as its share of Canopy Growth's equity losses and related activities, or a loss of $54.7 million on a comparable basis.  It also recognized a $839-million decrease in the fair value of its Canopy investments during the quarter ended Aug. 31, sending Constellation's shares in New York down roughly six per cent to $194.24 in midday trading.  Constellation's results come after Canopy ousted its co-founder and co-chief executive Bruce Linton in July following comments by the Modelo beer maker in June that it was ""not pleased"" with the pot producer's latest financial results.",business
446,Merger of Canada's Stars Group with Ireland's Flutter to create $9B online gaming giant,"The Stars Group Inc. has agreed to be acquired by Flutter Entertainment in an all-stock deal that will create one of the world's largest online betting and gambling companies, the companies announced Wednesday.  The proposal values the Stars Group at about $9 billion on based on Flutter's share price in London.  Shares of Toronto-based Stars Group closed up $6.24 or 30.81 per cent to $26.49 in Wednesday trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange.  Shareholders of Flutter, which is headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, will own approximately 54.64 per cent of the combined company when the deal closes next year, while TSG shareholders will own about 45.36 per cent.  The combined company's board and executive team is expected to have representatives from both companies, including the executive chair and the chief executive of Stars Group.    ""The board of TSG and I are delighted to recommend this exciting combination of TSG and Flutter, which we believe will create significant value for TSG's shareholders,"" TSG executive chairman Divyesh (Dave) Gadhia said in a statement.  He added that, under the leadership of TSG CEO Rafi Ashkenazi, who will become chief operating officer of Flutter, the company has grown and diversified the business beyond online poker to include gaming and sports betting.  TSG recently teamed up with Fox Sports to launch a betting platform in the United States, a relationship that would continue if the transaction gets the necessary approvals — expected in the second half of 2020.  Flutter CEO Peter Jackson, who will be chief executive of the combined company, said it would continue to work with Fox while also developing Flutter's FanDuel in the United States.  Fox Sports will have the right to acquire an approximate 18.5 per cent equity interest in FanDuel Group at its market value in 2021. Flutter's co-owners in the FanDuel Group will receive a payment based on Fox Bet's market value under a formula.  ""The combination will turbocharge our existing four-pillar strategy and provide world-class capabilities across sports betting, gaming, daily fantasy sports and poker, as well as greater geographical and product diversification,"" Jackson said.  Under terms of the agreement, shareholders of the Stars Group — formerly known as Amaya Inc. — will receive 0.2253 new Flutter shares for each TSG share.  Flutter shares were up about 11 per cent on the London Stock Exchange after the announcement. The shares were trading at about 85 British pounds each, valuing the offer worth about 19.15 pounds or C$31.12 per TSG share.  TSG shares closed at $20.25 on Tuesday at the Toronto Stock Exchange, giving the Toronto-based company a pre-announcement market value of about $5.8 billion.  In addition to regulatory approvals from the United Kingdom Ireland, Australia, the United States and Canada, the deal will require approval by Flutter and TSG shareholders. Their votes are expected in the second quarter of 2020.  The agreement is expected to close in the second or third quarter of 2020.",business
447,FAA orders airlines to inspect dozens of Boeing 737s for structural cracks,"The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said on Wednesday that aircraft operators must inspect 165 Boeing 737 NG airliners for structural cracks within seven days after the issue was found on a small number of planes.  Boeing Co notified the FAA of the issue after it discovered cracks on an aircraft undergoing modifications in China. The FAA said subsequent inspections found similar cracks in a small number of additional planes. The FAA said planes with fewer flights will eventually get inspected.  The order covers a total of 1,911 U.S. registered planes. The inspections can be done visually and should require about an hour per airplane, the FAA said.  The cracks are on what is known as the pickle fork — a part that attaches the plane's fuselage, or body, to the wing structure and manages forces.  Southwest Airlines Co, United Airlines and American Airlines Inc are among carriers that fly the 737 NG. The NG includes the 737-600, -700,-700C,-800, -900, and -900ER.    Southwest said it began the inspections on Tuesday and will fully comply within the required time. The company said it has not located any ""unusual findings.""  The airline added it has ""developed a schedule to perform overnight inspections"" and does not expect operational disruptions.  American Airlines spokesman Ross Feinstein said none of the company's 737-800 fleet ""fall into the seven-day requirement."" The company anticipates around 80 737-800 aircraft will require this inspection in the next eight months and the inspections won't impact its operation.  The FAA said the inspections would look for ""cracking of the left and right hand side outboard chords of frame fittings and failsafe straps."" It said the issue ""could adversely affect the structural integrity of the airplane and result in loss of control of the airplane.""  The 737 NG is the third-generation 737 and version before the now-grounded 737 Max, which is not impacted by the issue.  Boeing said on Friday it has been in contact with 737 NG operators about the discovery of cracks, but added ""no in-service issues have been reported.""  Reuters and other outlets late on Friday reported the planned inspections, but the FAA had not discovered overall details. The order will take effect on Thursday.    Aircraft with more than 30,000 cycles must be inspected within seven days, while planes between 22,600 and 29,999 cycles must be inspected within 1,000 cycles, which typically correspond to the number of flights. The FAA wants operators to ""report their findings to the agency immediately.""  United said it also does not fall under the seven-day time frame, and 80 of its airplanes are ""between the 22,600 and 29,999 cycles"" and will be inspected as required.",business
448,What happened when an Ontario company cut the work day by two hours,"Jim Moss felt his life couldn't get much more ironic.  His job title: Chief happiness officer of Plasticity Labs, a Kitchener company that helps businesses assess workplace culture and boost employee happiness.   His reality: Burnt out and often unhappy.  Determined to correct this imbalance, Moss and his four employees made a simple, radical change nine months ago.  They decided to work fewer hours.  Instead of ending the day at 5 p.m., the team would start at 9 a.m. and leave by 3 p.m.  Moss said his team had long told companies that flexible work hours and work-life balance were key to happiness and productivity, and felt they needed to practice what they preached.  ""We know there's a lot of data around when we're most productive throughout the day ... And so the least amount of high-quality work gets done at the end of the day,"" said Moss.  ""We looked at what are the things that we are doing or not doing outside of work to be healthy and happy. And the two biggest contributors are physical activity and then time with our families.""  As soon as Moss cut work hours, he had more time for both his family and regular exercise. He noticed he was not only happier, but able to take on more at the office.  ""I've got more not just physical energy, but cognitive and emotional energy available to do the work,"" said Moss.  Win for employees  Dave Whiteside, director of research at Plasticity Labs, said he was skeptical about the idea of cutting his workday by two hours.  ""We're a very tiny team with a heavy workload,"" he said.  ""The idea of losing a couple hours every day seemed initially like it was a potential issue. But I think it's allowed us to be more mindful of the time that we do have as well as the time that we've now been given back.""  Whiteside walks his dog and gets to the gym every day with the extra time. It doesn't mean he won't check his email when he's home or work on evenings and weekends. But the team says they try to limit the amount of work they do outside of office hours, and they have the flexibility to then adjust their hours during the week if they're putting in too much time outside of work.  It's only been about a month since Katherine Lewis started at Plasticity Labs as an office coordinator and executive assistant. She says she was surprised and delighted by the hours.  ""I have a number of the volunteer roles and [the hours] allows me to be able to give them more of my time and not have to worry about what's happening back at work or feeling nervous about needing to take that time,"" said Lewis.  'Times have changed'  Shorter work weeks isn't a new concept. Flexible and reduced working hours is a more common practice in Scandinavian countries, such as Sweden.  Anita Boey, who teaches at the Lazaridis School of Business and Economics at Laurier University, says shorter workdays are proven to boost happiness and productivity.  ""[Workers] are much happier because they know that after work they've got plans with family, they've got plans with friends,"" said Boey.  ""So there's something to look forward to at the end of the day rather than going back and you're so tired and you need to to get back to work the next day.""  But actually making a transition to shorter hours isn't something Boey sees catching on.  ""I believe that it's so much ingrained in our system right now that we believe a 9 to 5 job is is good. It's traditional. It's what gets people productive. Those are beliefs that we've been relying on and the times have changed.""  Jim Moss acknowledges the idea of cutting hours may not necessarily work in a larger company.  With five employees, Plasticity Labs was able to introduce the idea of shorter hours one week, and implement them the next.  ""I think that in the existing infrastructure of larger organizations it will die on its way up the ladder,"" said Moss.  ""The business case for it is still there. But I think that the implicit assumptions that we need to be here longer to get our work done are very strong currently.""",business

450,Red October for stock markets continues Wednesday as equities sell off again,"Stock markets just about everywhere sold off on Wednesday amid more signs that the global economy is getting worse and the U.S. government's response will do little to help things.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down at 494.42 points to 26,078 after losing more than 500 points throughout the day, while in Toronto the S&amp;Pu002FTSX Composite Index closed down at 136.69 to 16,310 after being down by 194 points throughout the day.  European shares fared even worse, with benchmark stock indices in France, Germany and Britain all down by at least two per cent. Wednesday's sell-off comes on the heels of a smaller one on Tuesday, the first day of October, which is traditionally a bumpy one for stock markets.  The catalyst for the sell-off seems to be growing signs that the global economy is slowing down and could even soon contract. A closely watched index of U.S. manufacturing on Tuesday showed that the sector has now shrunk for two months in a row. Worse, the Institute for Supply Management index actually fell to its lowest level in more than a decade.   Indicators in Europe and Asia are showing similar signs, which are stoking fears that the world economy could be about to tip into recession.    ""The global manufacturing recession is global,"" Kit Juckes with French investment bank Societé Generale said. ""Some of it comes from China, and some of it comes from the White House but it's pretty global, and while Germany is suffering worse than anyone else, even the U.S. is feeling it.""    Bond yields fell around the world. That's a sign that investors are shifting money into less-risky holdings because economic growth is in doubt.  Shares in financial companies like banks — which make up a large part of the TSX — sold off because lower interest rates are bad for their profit margins.  The World Trade Organization added to the concerns in a trade ruling that opens the door to even more tariffs on trade between Europe and the United States as part of a long-standing dispute over aerospace subsidies.  The deadline for Britain to exit the European Union is also rapidly approaching, with a hard deadline set for Oct. 31. That uncertainty could throw another roadblock in the way of the steady flow of goods and services around the world. Couple that with the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China showing no signs of waning, and you have a recipe for negativity.

Neil Campling, analyst at Mirabaud Securities, says investors are keeping a close eye on the numbers, and they're not liking what they see.

451,'Inferences' and 'absence of evidence' dog Meng Wanzhou hearing as Crown fights conspiracy theory,"It's one error. But does it point to a greater pattern?  A B.C. Supreme Court judge pondered the importance of a Canada Border Services Agency mistake Wednesday as she tried to decide how the misstep might fit into a conspiracy theory alleged by Meng Wanzhou's lawyers.  Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes repeatedly interrupted a lawyer for the Crown as he tried to minimize the significance of border officers giving the Huawei executive's phone passcodes to RCMP in error.  The mistake first emerged as an issue on Tuesday.  Meng's lawyers claim the CBSA and RCMP conspired with the FBI to ""trick"" Meng into volunteering information during a customs examination before she was officially arrested after landing at Vancouver's airport in December 2018.  Crown attorney John Gibb-Carsley said the passcode mistake needed to be viewed in the context of a larger set of events during which Canadian authorities acted entirely appropriately.  ""I'm reminded of the old adage: 'Never let the truth get in the way of a good story,'"" Gibb-Carsley told Holmes as he wrapped up the Crown's case.  The problem with the defence's theory of the case, he said: ""The truth gets in the way of their story.""  Alleged U.S. sanctions violation  Meng's lawyers want Holmes to order the disclosure of a wide variety of documents and records they believe will bolster an argument that Meng's rights were violated in the hours prior to her arrest.  The 47-year-old is facing possible extradition to the United States for allegedly violating U.S. sanctions against Iran.    She's accused of lying to banks about the nature of Huawei's relationship with a company in Tehran that was attempting to sell U.S. telecommunications equipment in violation of American sanctions.  Huawei claimed the company, Skycom, was a ""local partner."" But U.S. prosecutors claim the firm was actually a hidden subsidiary.  Sitting alongside her counsel, Meng has listened intently to arguments put forward by both defence and lawyers for Canada's attorney general.  But the issue of the phone passcodes has proven thorny.  'Inferences from absences'  Border officers seized the phones along with Meng's laptop and tablet when she emerged onto the jetway after flying into YVR from Hong Kong.  The FBI had suggested to RCMP the previous day that the devices be placed in Mylar bags to prevent them from being remotely wiped.  The Crown has argued that the border officers were just doing their job in determining if Meng was admissible to Canada. They say no one has ever actually searched the phones, which the FBI no longer even want.    But as she considered the facts, Holmes kept returning to the phones.  If the FBI didn't ask the CBSA to seize them, and the CBSA officers were supposedly acting independently, why were the Mylar bags used?  And if the border agents claim that they got the passcodes as part of the process of examining Meng's goods for evidence of criminality, why didn't they search them?  ""We're in a situation where we're being asked to draw inferences from absences,"" Holmes told Gibb-Carsley.   ""Since we're in the land of inferences because of the absence of evidence ... we have the fact that the passcodes were given along with the devices that CBSA took on the jetway and put in Mylar bags, and we have the fact that the U.S. request was for exactly that.""  From Meng to Bambi  In making their case, the Crown lawyers also drew on precedent set by one of Canada's most colourful fugitives — Lawrencia 'Bambi' Bembenek, a former Playboy Bunny and police officer who fled north in 1990 after escaping the U.S. prison where she was serving time for killing her husband's ex-wife.  In that case, Canadian immigration officials were accused of using deportation proceedings as a disguised form of extradition.    Likewise, Meng's lawyers claim that the CBSA search and questioning of Meng was just a pretence for a ""covert criminal investigation.""  In the Bembenek case, a judge found that immigration officials were acting in good faith in their efforts to deport a convicted killer.  Gibb-Carsley said the officers who dealt with Meng also had a legitimate purpose in guarding the border.  Like Meng, Bembenek's arrest in Canada drew media from around the world, resulting in a cottage industry of Run Bambi Run T-shirts and at least one TV movie, starring Tatum O'Neal.  But the similarities end there.  After fighting extradition, Bembenek returned to Wisconsin willingly in 1992.    Her original conviction was set aside when mistakes were found in the investigation. She pleaded no contest to second degree murder and was released on probation.  Bembenek moved to Washington state in the late 1990s to be with her parents.  She died of liver failure in 2010.",business
452,"Climate change debate polarization shows lack of leadership, says oilsands CEO","Polarization of the climate change debate as it relates to the role of the Canadian energy industry indicates an ""extreme"" lack of leadership from all political parties in Canada, says the CEO of oilsands producer MEG Energy Corp.  Speaking at the Natural Resources Summit in Calgary on Wednesday, Derek Evans said he's frustrated by the wide gulf in views exhibited by parties in the run-up to the Oct. 21 election.  ""Some of us have banged on the prime minister's door and said, 'I would like to talk to you,' but I can't get in. Either I'm not big enough, I'm not loud enough, I don't represent enough people,""' he said.  ""We're not shying away from trying to get in there and create those conversations but I'll go out on a limb and say I have never seen such an extreme lack of leadership across all parties about something that is as central and as critical to the jobs and the economy of this country.""  With polls showing the front-running Liberals and Conservatives in a close race, some observers have suggested a minority government might have to rely on support of the NDP or the Green Party, both of which have signalled they will not support expanding the Trans Mountain pipeline that Ottawa bought last year for $4.5 billion.  Evans told reporters later he couldn't expand on his views of the leadership issue because of new election rules that could result in him being fined if he says too much during the campaign.  Both Evans and Steve Laut, vice-chairman of Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., said they are working toward an ultimate goal of taking their companies to ""net zero"" in terms of greenhouse gas emissions.      MEG will accomplish that through efficiencies in using steam and solvents at its oilsands works and with carbon capture and storage, Evans said.  ""It's a multitude of technologies, a multitude of process changes that we're working on,"" said Laut, citing continuous improvements in oilsands extraction, carbon capture and storage and carbon capture and conversion, where new products are made from captured carbon.  Neither would provide a timeline to reach their goals.  Cleaner energy claims are suspicious, says Greenpeace  Claims of cleaner Canadian energy are suspicious, said Jesse Firempong of Greenpeace Canada, citing studies that show the industry is fourth-most greenhouse gas intensive in the world and that average emissions per barrel increased between 1990 and 2017.  Canadian Natural says it cut its corporate GHG intensity per barrel by 20 per cent between 2014 and 2018.  The summit, held to examine how the energy sector is dealing with rising environmental opposition such as last Friday's climate strike, was hosted by the Canadian Global Cities Council, a group of eight metro chambers of commerce and boards of trade from across Canada.  The Toronto Region Board of Trade supports oil and gas because of the economic benefits the country as a whole gains from having a healthy energy sector, said CEO Jan De Silva.  ""Jobs solve a lot of challenges for everyone in our communities,"" she said.  ""These are not Alberta's issues alone. How Canada can be a leader in natural resources and lead the world in clean tech matters greatly to Toronto and to the entire country.""",business
453,What voters need to know about deficits and the debt,"At the birth of Canada, the government already owed money and 20 cents out of every federal dollar was spent servicing that debt, says Livio Di Matteo, economics professor at Lakehead University.  Indeed, since Confederation, the federal government has run a deficit about 80 per cent of the time, according to Di Matteo, who has written extensively about deficits for the Fraser Institute think-tank.  However, as the CBC's Aaron Wherry reports, the political drive to balance a budget seems to have waned since Prime Minister Jean Chrétien and Finance Minister Paul Martin wrangled down Canada's deficit in the 1990s.    Still, the topic does come up during election campaigns, including the current one. CBC News explains some of the terms and issues surrounding deficits, debt and where the parties stand on balancing the books.  What's the difference between deficit and debt?  Simply put, when government revenues (the taxes it takes in) are less than its expenditures (the money it dishes out to pay for government services), the government records a deficit.       Got questions about the election? We've got the information you need. Text ""ELECTION"" to 22222 for our election toolkit. And if you've still got questions, ask us.    The accumulation of all the deficits, plus the interest since Confederation, is the debt. Di Matteo says there are a  few ways to look at the debt. There's the gross debt, or the total debt, and that's everything the federal government owes. There is also the ""federal debt,"" which is the difference between the government's total liabilities and total financial and non-financial assets.  Those non-financial assets, however, include things like the Parliament Buildings, Di Matteo says, which are unlikely to be sold off any time soon. So the net debt takes everything the federal government owes and subtracts the government's financial assets.  What's the current debtu002Fdeficit?  According to the Department of Finance, the government posted a budgetary deficit of $14 billion for the fiscal year that ended on March 31, 2019. (Compare that, for example, with the U.S., which just recorded a deficit topping a trillion dollars.)  The federal debt (the difference between total liabilities and total assets) stood at $685.5 billion and Canada's net debt is $768 billion. Meanwhile, U.S. debt is more than $22 trillion.  The Liberals seem to focus on the federal debt-to-GDP ratio. What is that measure?  The debt-to-GDP ratio is the the federal debt compared to the gross domestic product of the country. In other words, taking the debt and dividing it by the GDP.  ""There is no official number of what it should be. But generally, the higher it is the larger the debt burden,"" Di Matteo said.     Currently, Canada''s debt-to-GDP ratio stands at 30.9. According to Liberal projections, it will shrink to 30.2 per cent of GDP in 2023-2024.  For a comparison, before Chrétien and Martin embarked on a series of cuts, the federal debt-to-GDP ratio was 66.8. It was at its highest in 1946 at 108.9 per cent and at its lowest in 1913 at 11.3 per cent.    The reason the Liberals like to focus on this measurement is that Canada's debt-to-GDP ratio is the lowest among the G7 countries. For example, the figure for Japan is 237.5 per cent of GDP, 106.7 per cent for the United States and 99.2 per cent for France.  But the figure used by the Canadian government doesn't include the debt from all levels of government, like the provinces and municipalities. When those figures are included, the ratio, according to the International Monetary Fund, jumps to 88 per cent.  What about our debt per person?  That may be an easier way for people to understand our debt. The Canadian Taxpayers Federation calculated that every Canadian's share of the debt is a little over $18,000. (Compare that to the U.S., which, according to the U.S. Debt Clock, estimates debt per citizen at just under $69,000 US)  How is each party approaching the deficit?  The Liberals promised in the 2015 election campaign that they would run temporary deficits, but by 2019, Canadians could expect a balanced budget.     That never happened and isn't expected to happen in the near future.  According to the campaign platform they released, their government, if re-elected, would increase the deficit to $27.4 billion next year. It then projects deficits of more than $20 billion over the next three years. The party has not offered a firm timeline as to when it would balance the books.    Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer has said his government would take five years to balance the budget, but his party has not yet released its campaign platform, or any figures on the deficits they expect to run.  NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh hasn't been clear on how his government would tackle the federal deficit. The party's platform isn't fully costed and doesn't include deficit estimates  Back in September, at a campaign event in Ottawa, Singh would say only that his approach would be different from the one Justin Trudeau's Liberals have chosen and that his priority is helping Canadians now.  His party platform does say his government would ""manage debt and deficits responsibly, borrowing when required to defend the services that Canadians and their families rely on, and moving to balance when prudent.""  Green Leader Elizabeth May has committed to returning Canada to budgetary balance in five years. For the 2021-2022 fiscal year, a Green government would run up a $22.7-billion deficit, cut that down to around $19 billion the next year and come up with a $400-million surplus by 2023-24.  People's Party of Canada Leader Maxime Bernier has vowed that his government would present a balanced budget within two years of taking office.",business
454,Microsoft previews dual-screen Surface devices out in a year,"Microsoft's new lineup of Surface computers includes two dual-screen devices that won't be out for another year.  The smaller one, an Android phone called Surface Duo, will mark Microsoft's re-entry into smartphones, a market the company abandoned after flops with its own operating system and an ill-fated purchase of smartphone maker Nokia.  ""I believe the third time's a charm for Microsoft and smartphones,"" said Patrick Moorhead, an analyst with moor Insights &amp; Strategy.  He said Microsoft has had a good track record with Surface devices, while the Duo's novel design offers something new at a time when phone innovation has been slowing down.    Microsoft says the Duo makes phone calls, though it stopped short of calling it a phone. Though it runs Android, the back of the prototype has a Surface logo that resembles Windows. The company prefers calling the Duo just another Surface device.    Meanwhile, the larger Surface Neo runs a dual-screen variant of Windows called 10X. In a blog post, Microsoft said other manufacturers including Asus, Dell, HP and Lenovo will also make dual-screen and foldable devices using Windows 10X.  Competing with other tech giants  Both Surface devices feature two screens connected with a hinge and can fold like laptops. They can display separate apps side by side or a single app stretched across both screens. They are technologically less ambitious than foldable phones from Samsung and others, whose screens actually bend as the devices close. Some of those folding phones have experienced technical difficulties.  The devices will initially be available only for developers who create and test apps. Microsoft plans to start selling them during the 2020 holiday season.  Available sooner are $249 US Surface Earbuds, as Microsoft joins Apple, Amazon, Google and others in making wireless listening devices.    At a product event in New York, Microsoft also unveiled two new Surface Pro tablets. The Surface Pro X will have a 13-inch screen, rather than the 12-inch ones on the new Pro 7 and older models. But the X will be about the same size overall, thanks to a smaller bezel.  The company also unveiled a refreshed laptop.",business
455,WTO allows U.S. to retaliate with tariffs on EU exports because of Airbus subsidies,"The World Trade Organization says the United States can impose tariffs on up to $7.5 billion US worth of goods from the European Union as retaliation for illegal subsidies that the bloc gave to plane-maker Airbus — a record award from the trade body.  The move green-lights the Trump administration to slap countermeasures on the 28-member bloc and follows a WTO ruling in May 2018 on the Airbus subsidies.  Wednesday's award doesn't end the long-running trans-Atlantic dispute over aircraft: WTO arbitrators are expected to rule next year on how much the EU can impose in tariffs following a separate decision that went against Boeing.  The U.S. has already announced plans to impose tariffs on EU cheeses, olives, whisky, as well as aircraft and aircraft parts. Wednesday's decision saw a fine-tuning of that list.  The Trump administration put 25 per cent tariffs on French wine, Italian cheese and single-malt Scotch whisky — but spared Italian wine, pasta and olive oil and all EU-made chocolate.  The U.S. Trade Representative's Office released a list of hundreds of European products that will get new tariffs, including cookies, salami, butter and yogurt — but in many cases applied to only some EU countries, and included German and British camera parts, as well as U.K.-made blankets, sweaters, pullovers, cashmere items and wool clothing.  They will also apply to olives from France, Germany and Spain, Italian cheeses, EU-produced pork sausage and other pork products other than ham, and German coffee.  The biggest single tariff imposed is a 10 per cent levy on EU-made airplanes, a levy that could hurt U.S. airlines that have ordered billions of dollars of Airbus aircraft.  The new tariffs are to take effect on Oct. 18.    The EU's top trade official responded to the announcement by saying the bloc would prefer to reach a settlement with the United States to avoid a tariff war — but it will respond if President Donald Trump imposes new duties on EU products.    EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said a tariff war ""would only inflict damage on businesses and citizens on both sides of the Atlantic, and harm global trade and the broader aviation industry at a sensitive time.""  ""If the U.S. decides to impose WTO authorized countermeasures, it will be pushing the EU into a situation where we will have no other option than to do the same,"" she said.  The arbitration award is the largest among about two dozen at the WTO since it was created nearly 25 years ago. The previous record award of $4 billion was in 2002, when the WTO ruled against the U.S. over the Foreign Sales Corporation law that allowed for illegal subsidies to some U.S. businesses.    Unlike the Trump administration's unilateral tariffs on billions of dollars-worth of steel, aluminum and other goods from China, the EU and elsewhere, the retaliatory tariffs authorized in the Airbus case enjoy a stamp of approval from the WTO — an organization that Trump has repeatedly criticized.  A May 2018 WTO ruling found that EU ""launch aid"" for Airbus had resulted in lost sales for Boeing in the twin-aisle and very-large-aircraft markets. The ruling centred on two aircraft: Airbus's 350XWB — a rival of Boeing's 787 — and the double-decker A380, which surpassed the Boeing 747 as the world's largest commercial passenger plane.  Dispute goes back to 2004  The case itself dates to 2004, a testament to the plodding and thorough rhythm of the Geneva-based trade body.  The Trump administration has been demanding reform of the WTO, and has been blocking new appointments to its crucial Appellate Body — which could be rendered inactive in December unless the U.S. gets its way.  The WTO is already examining a dozen cases involving U.S. tariffs and countermeasures brought by its trading partners over the administration's steel and aluminum tariffs. Trump has insisted the move is needed to protect U.S. national security interests, but the Europeans claim it is simply protectionism and breaks global trade rules.  The EU introduced ""rebalancing"" tariffs on about $3 billion US worth of steel, agricultural and other products. Trump has also threatened to slap duties on European automakers.  ",business

457,"It's a bird! It's a plane! It's ... your delivery, as UPS gets cleared to launch delivery drones","UPS has won government approval to operate a nationwide fleet of drones, which will let the company expand deliveries on hospital campuses and move it one step closer to making deliveries to consumers.  Many regulatory obstacles remain, however, before UPS — or other operators who are testing drones — can fill the sky over cities and suburbs with drones carrying goods to people's doorsteps.  United Parcel Service Inc. said Tuesday that its drone subsidiary was awarded an airline certificate last week by the Federal Aviation Administration, the first U.S. company to get such a broad approval.  Even before getting that designation, UPS Flight Forward, as the subsidiary is called, has operated more than 1,000 flights at WakeMed's hospital campus in Raleigh, North Carolina.  The designation removes limits on the size of the company's potential drone operation. Flight Forward can fly an unlimited number of drones, a key step toward expanding the operation. It can also fly drones at night — the company plans to do that after installing the necessary colored warning lights on each machine.    However, UPS still faces severe restrictions before it can run a large commercial operation with drones.  For example, drones won't be allowed to fly beyond the sight of the operator without an FAA exemption for each route. Also, each flight will need a separate operator. Scott Price, the company's chief strategy officer, said UPS will eventually apply for FAA permission to have a single operator fly multiple drones at the same time.  The airline certificate lets UPS fly drones carrying more than 55 pounds, ""but we're not comfortable we have the hardware for that yet,"" Price said in an interview.  Operations will be limited to campus-like settings because FAA has not yet written regulations to allow commercial drone flights over populated areas. Price said UPS is eyeing ""hundreds"" of campuses in the U.S., including hospitals, colleges and office complexes.  Price said the Wake Forest experiment has been successful, with only ""a few"" drone flights canceled for mechanical problems or because of bad weather. He said none have crashed. With a special FAA exemption, the company operated a drone flight there on Friday beyond the sight of the operator, which Price said was a first for a revenue-generating delivery.    UPS believes the earliest commercially viable uses of drones will be for same-day deliveries, for augmenting truck-borne deliveries in rural areas, and for larger drones that could carry cargo of up to a ton from one rural area to another. Price said the latter idea is still years away.  Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao called the decision a step forward in integrating drones into the U.S. airspace and maintaining U.S. leadership in unmanned aviation.  UPS is racing against technology companies and startups to develop commercial-scale deliveries by drone to consumers.  Amazon.com CEO Jeff Bezos promised in 2014 that drones would be making deliveries to people's homes by 2019, but regulatory and technological hurdles proved too much for that prediction. Earlier this year, the FAA gave permission for a unit of Google parent Alphabet Inc. to make drone deliveries, but only in a tiny piece of southwestern Virginia.  Other delivery companies such as Germany's DHL Express are testing drones. UPS rival FedEx plans to take part in tests by the Alphabet unit, called Wing Aviation.    Ryan Citron, a transportation analyst at Navigant, said UPS was not the best-known player in drones — ""Bezos gets more headlines,"" he noted — but the company went about launching its subsidiary and seeking FAA approval. UPS has leapfrogged those rivals, at least for now, by being able to offer services in hundreds of campus settings.  Citron said that UPS' performance on hospital and college grounds will help determine how quickly regulators will approve consumer deliveries.  ""If everything works well, it gives them legitimacy to move into the residential space more quickly,"" he said, ""but if there are some major crashes or incidents it could slow down the approval process. It's going to be an important test bed.""  In the U.S., drone operators have been frustrated by the lack of FAA regulations to allow drones to fly over urban and suburban areas, and to set rules for remote identification of drones. The latter rule would help law enforcement agencies, which were given authority under a law passed last year to track, intercept and destroy drones that they deem a security threat.",business

""Importantly, the ADT Canada acquisition . . . also supports the continued advancement of Telus's health strategy,"" including remote patient care, Telus said in a statement.  ADT Canada employs about 1,000 people and has approximately 500,000 residential and business customers — about five times the number at Telus SmartHome Security and Secure Business, which was launched last year.  For its part, Florida-based ADT plans to give the money to its shareholders and focus on its U.S. operations. The company will pay a one-time special dividend of up to $550 million US, or 70 cents per share, for its shareholders when the deal closes.  ""The sale of our more capital intensive Canadian operations enables us to sharpen our focus on the exciting growth and higher margin opportunities in the U.S., where we can more efficiently invest our time and resources,"" ADT Inc. president and CEO Jim DeVries said in a statement.  ADT Inc. also said there will be a non-cash charge in the third quarter in connection with the transaction, but didn't provide an estimate.  Growing business  Several of Canada's major phone and cable companies have identified home security and home automation services as growth opportunities for their latest generation of networks, including fifth-generation wireless service.  Bell Canada parent BCE Inc. bought AlarmForce Industries for about $182 million in a deal that closed in early 2018 and then later sold 30,000 AlarmForce customer accounts in British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan to Telus for about $66.5 million.  Rogers Communications Inc. also offers customers home security services.  Telus estimates that its home security business added more than 12,000 new customers in the third quarter, bringing its total security subscriber base to about 100,000 prior to the ADT acquisition.

459,Lime and Bird popularity creating demand for e-scooter sales,"For most of the summer, Ken Cheung didn't even carry e-scooters at his shop in downtown Calgary, although that quickly changed in late July.  Lime had just rolled out its e-scooter rental program and the city's inner city was buzzing with the white and green machines.   Cheung's store specializes in selling electric and folding bikes. Still, people were calling and coming into the shop asking about e-scooters.  ""Absolutely,"" said Cheung, manager of Power in Motion. ""We've had quite a bit of demand.""  The shop sells a few of the two-wheeled machines every week, which usually cost between $800 and $1,300.   ""You have the people who want to buy one for fun, and then you also have those who just want to buy one to commute because they had access to the Lime e-scooter and they found out, hey, this is not a bad way to commute to work,"" he said.  The Lime and Bird scooters function similarly to bike-share programs or services like Car2Go.     Lime now operates in Calgary, Edmonton and Montreal. A pilot program in Waterloo, Ont., recently wrapped up.   Meanwhile, Bird has expanded to Calgary and Edmonton. The company set up in Toronto's Distillery District for a few weeks last month, so people could to try them in a limited area. Uber's Jump service, offering electric bikes and scooters, is available in Montreal.  Currently, Ontario legislation prohibits e-scooter use on public streets, although the Ontario Ministry of Transportation has started a consultation process on the topic.  Some people have complained the devices are an eyesore and a hazard, as they are often left on sidewalks or in parks. In Calgary, 60 patients with e-scooter-related injuries landed in the emergency room within the first two weeks the ride-sharing e-scooters became available.  Still, the devices have proven to be quite popular. More than 277,000 rides were recorded in August on Lime e-scooters in Calgary, according to municipal statistics. Some people are moving from part-time users to full-time users, and that's driving demand for ownership.  ""People don't want to spend a thousand dollars not knowing if it is something they want. If they are able to rent it for a buck a minute or something like that, it just allows them to try it out,"" said Cheung. The ride-sharing programs are making it easier to sell the scooters because there's familiarity. ""They come in and they already know what they want.""   In Calgary, it costs only a dollar to unlock an e-scooter, using Lime's smartphone app, and 30 cents per minute after that.    Marketing professor David Finch at Mount Royal University in Calgary, said shops haven't had to advertise, since ""Bird and Lime are building the awareness of the product to the customer.""  ""It's a classic 'try before you buy,' said Finch.  ""In this context, there was very little market for a scooter because there was no precedent for them in this city. As a result of the Lime and Bird craze that we've seen, people have said this is a relatively efficient approach for micro-mobility, specifically for the downtown core,"" he said.  Lime and Bird have expanded around the world, but Finch says the drawback in Canada is that the machines can't operate year-round.  ""You only have a narrow season for these things,"" he said. ""So, it will be interesting to see whether the business case makes sense, whether you own it or borrow it in a shared format, for something you can only use six months of the year.""    In Calgary, personal e-scooters face stricter rules than the ones owned by ride-sharing programs, and are legally confined to pathways  ""Operating a personally owned electric scooter anywhere on the road right-of-way, including city sidewalks, bike lanes or roadway, is still illegal [in Alberta],"" said Kara Bussey, a spokesperson for the city's transportation department.  ""The provincial exemption to operate an electric scooter only applies to the electric scooters owned by permit holders operating in the Shared Electric Scooter Pilot,"" she said in an emailed statement.",business
460,Slump in U.S. manufacturing knocks stock market to lowest point in 5 weeks,"U.S. stocks sank to their worst loss in five weeks on Tuesday after a surprisingly limp report on the nation's manufacturing stirred worries about the economy's strength.  The report showed that manufacturing weakened in September for the second straight month as U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war with China dragged on confidence and factory activity. It dashed economists' expectations that August's contraction had been an aberration, and markets reversed course immediately after its release. Both stocks and bond yields erased early-morning gains to drop sharply lower.  The S&amp;P 500 slumped to its first loss of more than one per cent since August, while the yield on the 10-year Treasury dropped to 1.63 per cent from 1.74 per cent shortly before the report's release, which is a big move. Three stocks fell for every one that rose on the New York Stock Exchange, and gold climbed as investors sought safer ground.  Investors also ratcheted up expectations for the Federal Reserve to come to the economy's aid. They increasingly believe the Fed will cut interest rates by half a percentage point at its meeting later this month, rather than the quarter point they were forecasting a day earlier.  The Fed already cut rates twice this summer as it tries to shield the U.S. economy from the effects of the trade war and slowing global economic growth. They were the first cuts since the financial crisis was toppling economies around the world in 2008.  The S&amp;P 500 was down 1.2 per cent by closing, or 36 points, its worst loss since Aug. 23.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 343 points, or 1.3 per cent, to 26,573, and the Nasdaq composite fell 90 points of 1.1 per cent.  The S&amp;Pu002FTSX Composite Index was down 211 points or 1.27 per cent.  Manufacturing woes  The Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing index was at 47.8 last month, and any reading below 50 indicates a contraction. Economists had been expecting growth to resume in September, and they had forecast a reading of 50.4, according to FactSet.  Manufacturers say global trade remains the most significant issue, and all the uncertainty caused by the trade war is hurting exporters in particular. Businesses are unsure what the rules of international trade will be a few months from now, let alone a few years, and it's causing CEOs to pull back on their spending plans.  ""The disappointing data is only fanning long-standing fears of slowing global growth,"" said Alec Young, managing director of Global Markets Research at FTSE Russell.  Manufacturing is a relatively small part of the economy, but investors worry about whether it will spill into other areas. That puts an even bigger spotlight on Friday's jobs report, which economists expect to show an acceleration in hiring.  Household spending has been the bulwark holding up the economy, particularly when manufacturing and business spending are under threat, and a strong job market helps households keep spending. But uncertainty is looming even there.  A report last week showed that consumer spending rose less than economists expected in August. Two reports on consumer confidence last week also gave a mixed picture, with one falling below expectations and the other rising above.  Last month's jobs report was also surprisingly weak, but that may have been a one-off, some analysts say.  ""The month of August over the last 10 years has been the wonkiest jobs report of the year,"" said Philip Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors. It often falls below expectations, only for the numbers to be revised higher in subsequent months.  Also coming later this week is a Thursday report from the Institute for Supply Management on activity in services industries.  Rate watch  After the weak manufacturing report, investors say the most likely move for the Federal Reserve is to cut short-term rates by half a percentage point from their current level of 1.75 per cent to 2.25 per cent.  The Fed and other central banks around the world have been aggressive in keeping rates low to help sustain the global economy.  Charles Schwab upended the brokerage industry when it said it will eliminate mobile and web trading commissions for stocks, exchange-traded funds and options listed in the United States and Canada. It's the latest move in an industrywide pricing war that's dramatically cut the cost of investing for customers.    Schwab fell 11.4 per cent after the announcement, but rivals sank even more. TD Ameritrade lost 26 per cent, and ETrade Financial dropped 17.8 per cent.  Stocks in Europe moved broadly lower and Asian stocks were mixed, though Chinese markets were closed for the National Day holiday marking the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic.  Inflation in the 19 countries that use the euro weakened in September, slipping farther from the European Central Bank's goal. Also, The World Trade Organization cut sharply its forecasts for trade growth this year and next. It expects global trade to weaken this year to the slowest pace since the Great Recession due to the U.S.-China trade war.",business
461,"Forever 21 closure signals ongoing shift in future of malls, analysts say","Analysts say the closure of Forever 21 stores across Canada isn't a sign that malls are a dying breed, but that retail competition is stiffer than ever and companies need to innovate to survive.  The Los-Angeles based clothing retailer plans to close all 44 of its stores in Canada along with 168 in the U.S. as the chain undergoes bankruptcy proceedings.  Several of those stores are in B.C., including a two-storey location inside Burnaby's Metropolis at Metrotown and a massive location in Surrey's Guildford Town Centre.  Despite the empty storefronts that will be left behind, retail analysts aren't concerned about the health of malls.  ""We found in the last couple of years that actually with some exceptions the malls are improving their productivity,"" said Mark Startup, vice president at the Vancouver office of the Retail Council of Canada.    An analysis by the council of the top malls in the country found 27 of 30 locations all saw annual per-square-foot sales increases between 2017 and 2018.  Startup says Canadian consumers are spending more on goods and products every year, but competition among retailers both on and offline, particularly in fashion, is rising, leading to news of more chains shutting down.  ""It is increasing. It's quite intense and retailers need to be very, very astute and very focused on their particular brand,"" said Startup.  He says 90 per cent of purchases made by Canadians are still done at brick and mortar stores.  Shopping malls as community hubs  Mall landlords have also shifted how they view their properties, which has helped with revenue growth.  It's no longer just about filling space with a mix of tenants but becoming a community hub, says Craig Patterson the editor of Retail Insider, a Canadian retail industry publication.  ""One of the biggest trends I'm seeing in shopping centres is for landlords to actually be redeveloping their properties by adding housing, offices in some cases, hotels, flexible co-working space,"" he said.    Sprawling mall parking lots sitting on prime real estate are ripe for redevelopment, but Patterson says previous contracts with anchor tenants like Sears often went for decades thereby restricting landlords from making major moves.    The trend is already playing out on the Lower Mainland.  Redevelopment at Brentwood Town Centre and, eventually, Oakridge Centre will create a forest of high rises connected to the malls.  The addition of theatres and more upscale dining halls over food courts are adding to the trend of malls as community hubs.    But even with the changes mall owners are making to keep people on their properties, Patterson warns, it still comes down to individual retailers creating positive shopping environments in-store.  With competition from international brands, e-commerce sites and even thrift stores, it's survival of the fittest.  WATCH - From The National, fast fashion a downfall for Forever 21:  ",business
462,Global trade to see weakest growth since Great Recession: WTO,"Global trade is forecast to weaken this year to the slowest pace since the depths of the Great Recession due to the U.S.-China trade war.  The World Trade Organization said Tuesday it expects volumes of traded goods to rise 1.2 per cent this year, far below the 2.6 per cent estimate it issued in April and the weakest since 2009.  Next year's growth was estimated to drop to 2.7 per cent from 3.0 per cent, but the organization warned that still depends on solving trade disputes.  The U.S. and China in particular are in a wide-ranging dispute that has led to new tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of traded goods. There is little expectation of an imminent resolution to the disagreement, which continues to sap economic growth.  ""The darkening outlook for trade is discouraging but not unexpected,"" said WTO chief Roberto Azevedo.    The WTO sees continued risks from the trade wars, saying that ""further rounds of tariffs and retaliation could produce a destructive cycle of recrimination.""  The organization noted some economies are slowing anyway and other issues, such as the U.K's anticipated exit from the European Union, are adding to uncertainty for businesses trading goods.",business
463,Splitting costs between roommates can be tricky business,"Thousands of Canadians move in with new roommates every fall and realize they've got a conundrum: how to handle splitting the costs.  When done right, dividing expenses with a roommate can alleviate plenty of headaches, but when done wrong, it can rip apart friends and break up relationships.  Desirae Odjick, a 30-year-old personal finance blogger in Ottawa, knows this well after years living with roommates.  Rent is the easiest to split when rooms are the same size and everyone feels they're getting an equal share of the unit or home, so the cost can be split 50-50, Odjick says.  Trouble comes when rooms are different sizes or one has an ensuite bathroom.      If one room is significantly better than the others, then I think one of the most fair ways to decide who gets the extra amenities is to assign a higher rent to that room.  - Desirae Odjick, personal finance blogger     ""If one room is significantly better than the others, then I think one of the most fair ways to decide who gets the extra amenities is to assign a higher rent to that room,"" Odjick says.  Unless there are extenuating circumstances where one person uses significantly more water or electricity, she recommends splitting utility fees equally.  Odjick considers internet and television a shared resource and payment for such services should be divided evenly unless you or your roommate is downloading more, needs a faster internet connection for work or doesn't plan to use it.  ""When I first graduated university, I lived with a great roommate and we agreed to share some of the costs of living together — notably internet. We had a conversation about the amount of data we'd each need, and I asked him if he would like to add TV to the package, since I had a few shows I liked watching live,"" Odjick says.  ""He shared that he didn't really want the TV part, so we agreed to split the internet portion of the bill equally, and I'd cover the TV portion, even though it was bundled together.""    If you're in a situation where one person won't use one of the services or will use significantly less, Odjick recommends an honest discussion to sort out payment.  Some people feel a roommate contributing furniture or kitchenware is doing everyone else a favour by saving them from shelling out for things like a couch or table, but whether that warrants a break on rent can go either way. Odjick recommends a chat between roommates early on to reach a consensus.  Food the most difficult expense to split  She feels cleaning supplies should be treated as a shared expense.  Food is one of the trickiest expenses to split with roommate, especially if you're not in a romantic relationship with them, says Odjick, because it quickly becomes ""a matter of preference and volume.""  ""You might eat way more than I do or like to eat things I'd never buy for myself,"" she says.  Odjick recommends roommates only share food if they are really close with their roommate and comfortable enough to have conversations around what to buy, how much to spend and how much you'll realistically eat.

464,"NDP would allow new parents to receive full EI benefit over shortened leave, Singh says","NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh says a New Democrat government would allow new parents to condense their employment-insurance benefits so they can take shorter parental leaves while still receiving the full benefit.  Speaking at Roots Cafe in Vancouver, where he met with young families Tuesday morning before flying to Ottawa, Singh said parental-leave benefits need to be more flexible.  Allowing new parents to condense their parental leaves would give breathing room to families who would struggle to live on 33 per cent of their salaries for a full 18-month leave period, he said.  ""It's something that would allow flexibility to families who can't afford to live off the reduced amount,"" he said.  Condensing parental-leave benefits is one of several ways the NDP would adjust the distribution of EI benefits.  Many Canadians work precarious jobs with unsteady hours, so the NDP is also proposing a universal qualifying threshold of 360 hours for regular EI coverage.  ""It will allow for more coverage for more people. That's a bold step forward that responds to the reality of a lot of workers who aren't working a traditional job with traditional hours,"" he said.  Currently, workers need to have accumulated between 420 and 700 hours of insurable employment during a qualifying period — typically a year — to be entitled to EI benefits.        A New Democrat government would also increase the wage-replacement rate to 60 per cent from 55 per cent.  Tuesday was the NDP campaign's eighth straight day in British Columbia, where Singh has made several regionally focused announcements.  The cafe meet-and-greet came the day after Singh said an NDP government would spend $10 billion over the next four years to create 500,000 new child-care spaces in Canada with the goal of offering free services for some parents.  Singh said prices would be capped at $10 a day and build on a similar program in Quebec as well as a pilot project that started last year in British Columbia.    He said the goal is to get to universality, which would mean no cost for families that can't afford it and low cost for those that can.  The Liberals have promised that new parents won't pay any taxes on maternity and parental leave benefits, while the Conservatives have promised a tax credit that would effectively return the money paid.  The Liberals have also pledged to extend EI benefits for parents who adopt and to increase the Canada Child Benefit for children under a year old. Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer has argued that benefit mirrors a similar program introduced by a previous Conservative government that saw all families, regardless of income, receive monthly payments.

465,U.S. retains measles-elimination status despite worst outbreak in 25 years,"The United States has narrowly retained its World Health Organization measles elimination status, despite seeing 1,249 measles cases so far this year in the worst outbreak since 1992, federal health officials said on Friday.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control said that 75 per cent of cases of the highly contagious and sometimes deadly disease this year were associated with outbreaks in New York City and New York State, and blamed the spread on parents who had opted not to vaccinate their children.  ""Both jurisdictions have since passed two incubation periods for measles with no additional reported cases associated with these outbreaks as of Oct. 1, 2019; however, continued vigilance is important to ensure that elimination is sustained,"" the report said.  An outbreak is typically considered over when there are no new measles cases reported for 42 days, which is double the incubation time for the disease.    The disease was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000, meaning there was no continuous transmission for a year, and the outbreak in New York this year narrowly avoided meeting that threshold. The last rash onset associated with a measles case in New York, where the outbreak initially centred on Orthodox Jewish communities, was recorded on Aug. 19.  Health officials have attributed the outbreak, which affected 31 states this year, to a vocal fringe of U.S. parents who refuse to vaccinate their children because they believe, contrary to scientific evidence, that ingredients in them can cause autism.",health
466,"U.S. vaping-related illnesses surpass 1,000, CDC says","The outbreak of U.S. vaping-related illnesses has surpassed 1,000 cases.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday that 1,080 confirmed and probable cases have been reported in 48 states and one U.S. territory. The count includes 18 deaths in 15 states.  The first illnesses occurred in late March. Recently, 200 or more cases have been reported each week. Only Alaska and New Hampshire have yet to report cases.  Doctors say the illnesses resemble an inhalation injury. Symptoms include severe shortness of breath, fatigue and chest pain.  So far, officials have not identified a particular electronic cigarette, vaping device, liquid or ingredient behind the outbreak. But most who got sick said they vaped products containing tetrahydrocannabinol or THC, the marijuana ingredient that gives a high.  Over 440 samples of products from 18 states have been collected to date, and those numbers continue to increase, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officials said on a media call Thursday.    The FDA said there currently does not appear to be one product or substance involved in all of the cases.  In Canada, a Quebec resident has been diagnosed as the country's first case of a severe vaping-related breathing illness.  Canadian health officials say anyone who has used an e-cigarette or vaping products, and has symptoms such as shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, with or without vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain or fever is advised to consult a health-care professional.  People who switched to vaping to cut down on smoking cigarettes should not go back to cigarettes, Canadian and U.S. health officials said. ",health
467,"Colorectal cancer screening may not be best for all, new guideline says","Routinely screening everyone aged 50 to 79 for colorectal cancer may not be the best approach, a panel of Canadian and international experts say.  Colorectal cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in Canada affecting about 25,000 a year. It is the second leading cause of cancer death in Canada in men, and the third leading cause of death in women.  Currently, Canadian gastroenterology guidelines call for screening to begin at age 50 for those without a diagnosed parent, child or sibling.   Dr. Gordon Guyatt, professor of medicine at McMaster University in Hamilton, chaired a panel to review the latest evidence on screening to reduce the risk of developing or dying of colorectal cancer by removing precancerous growths called polyps.  Most guidelines recommend starting screening at age 50. At that point, the risk of developing colorectal cancer over the next 15 years is about one to two per cent.  ""We ended up suggesting … if your risk is over three per cent, perhaps not a bad idea to go through screening,"" Guyatt said. ""If it's under three per cent then for you the benefits might not be worth the harms and burdens.""  As a result, the new guideline says those at lower than average risk may favour holding off on screening.   Individualized approach  In Wednesday's issue of BMJ, the panel suggested individuals turn to an online calculator called Magicapp. Users can plug in their age, sex, family history of colorectal cancer, body mass index, smoking status, ethnicity and other information to estimate your risk of developing colorectal cancer in the next 15 years.  Dr. Linda Rabeneck, vice president of prevention and cancer control at Cancer Care Ontario, said the panel called for a more individualized approach to colorectal screening to help people make an informed decision.  ""It's fair to say that's not what we're doing today in colorectal cancer screening in general not just in Canada but beyond if you look in Europe and so forth,"" Rabeneck said.  The gastroenterologist said everyone over 50 is invited to screening. Then the interval between screens stays the same even though the risk increases with age.  But the cancer field is moving away from taking a blanket approach to the whole population and refining it to consider an individual's risk.  ""On balance I think that this is something we need to think hard about,"" she said.  Dr. Desmond Leddin, an adjunct professor in gastroenterology at Dalhousie University in Halifax, said he would not change current practice based on the new guideline. He has another priority.  ""All Canadians should have access to a family doctor since in our system they are gatekeepers to care,"" Leddin said in an email.  ""I agree with the authors that the risks and benefits of screening should be weighed up and that is best done in a conversation with a family doctor. Many people do not have a family doctor and some provinces send the screening test directly to the patient.""  'Seismic shift'  The researchers had gold-standard randomized control trial data on tens of thousands to compare sigmoidoscopy, a scope of the lower part of the colon, to no screening to draw on for their review.  But for newer screening with an at-home fecal test called fecal immunochemical test (FIT) and colonoscopy of the entire organ, the trials aren't yet complete. Instead, the authors used models filled with assumptions, Rabeneck said.    A journal editorial published with the study called the move away from organized screening and towards informed choice a ""seismic shift.""  Philippe Autier at the International Prevention Research Institute in Lyon, France, wrote that the objective of public health policies is to persuade people to attend screening and to maximize uptake. Screening messages tend to overstate benefits and downplay potential consequences.  In contrast, the individualized approach ""is increasingly regarded as the most appropriate way to discuss cancer screening,"" Autier said.",health
468,Markham boutique hotel for dementia patients built to give their caregivers a break,"When her close friend's husband was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's at the age of 65, Liliane Vidicek saw just how taxing caring for him could be. His decline was rapid and within 14 months he needed care around the clock.  So Vidicek became one of his caregivers to help give her friend a break.  ""It's very, very important — that's the biggest issue. They can't get away or even if they have somebody come in, they're still always there,"" she said.  So, she thinks it's great that a new hotel opening in Markham, Ont., Friday will provide premium short-term care for people living with memory loss or dementia, so their caregivers can have some respite.   Experts say the demand for such as service is expected to grow as more than half a million Canadians have dementia. That number is expected to double within 15 years as Canada's population ages, putting pressure on hundreds of thousands of loved ones who will have to step into the role of caregiver.    ""So if they could drop them off and kind of separate themselves from the person knowing that their loved one is well taken care of — it gives them great peace of mind,"" Vidicek said.  The hotel is the latest project by Memory &amp; Company, which opened an adult daycare centre in Markham four years ago for clients who have dementia and are not eligible, or cannot get into, a long-term care facility.  ""When you're a caregiver for somebody living with memory loss it's a 'round-the-clock responsibility,"" said Ashley Kwong, Memory &amp; Company's creator and director of operations.  ""A lot of families really struggle with working full-time and then caring for somebody when they get home at night. It's a 24-hour-a-day, seven-days-a-week responsibility.""    The term dementia describes symptoms affecting brain function caused by neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, although injuries or other types of vascular disease can lead to a decline in cognitive abilities, such as memory, awareness of person, place, and time.  As it progresses, dementia can mean a person needs help with daily activities, such as eating, bathing, dressing and going to the toilet.  But Kwong says care doesn't necessarily have to be in an institutional setting.  ""We've done it as upscale boutique hotel feel,"" said Kwong, who adds it's more like all-inclusive resort with 24- hour nursing activities and even fine dining prepared by an executive chef in an open concept gourmet kitchen.  ""We really want to make sure that when people come here they feel like they're coming to a resort.""  Kwong says the hotel was built with dementia design principles in mind — including circular hallways, private rooms with ensuite washrooms and motion sensors throughout for a secure and safe environment.  There's a physical fitness studio, outdoor lounges and even a movie theatre along with cognitive fitness programs including music and art therapy that have been developed by York University and the University of Toronto, Baycrest and the Art Gallery of Ontario.    ""You want them to feel like they're coming to a place where they will be pampered, so that caregivers will have guilt free respite knowing that their loved one's coming here and being really well taken care of and having a great time,'' said Kwong.  ""So that they can go and have that time to themselves without having to worry and actually go and enjoy their free time themselves.""    Nalini Sen, the director of research with the Alzheimer Society of Canada, says such a hotel can make a big difference in the lives of those with dementia and improve their care.  ""Providing care for someone with Alzheimer's disease and dementia takes a tremendous toll on caregivers both physically and emotionally,"" said Sen.  ""And yet many caregivers don't often recognize the warning signs or deny the effects because they tend to push their own needs to the side,"" she added.    ""This is an essential service that really should be provided to caregivers. You know taking a break and having a chance to do something for yourself to get away from the demands that have been placed on you.""  Sen hopes the next federal government commits to funding a national dementia strategy and to researching dementia prevention, advance therapies and potential cures.  Sen would also like to see support for such respite centres like Memory &amp; Company's hotel, which is a private, for-profit business.  Kwong points out that at $299 a night, the hotel is a third of the price of home care.    ""Families are spending $35 an hour for home care, where we're working out to about $12.50 an hour and then you get everything including meals,"" said Kwong. ""So everything is included ... We have 24 hour nursing here, as well and a minimum five-to-one staffing ratio.""  Liliane Vidicek says the hotel won't be the right fit for all caregivers and their loved ones.  ""Not everybody can afford it, but for those who can this is kind of like they're doing something special for their loved one,"" she said. ""So it's a little bit of an indulgence.""    Vidicek started a website to share resources with those who may be new to caring for someone with dementia.   ""Not all levels of people with Alzheimer's are appropriate for that kind of facility, but many will be, especially at the beginning of dementia and Alzheimer's when caregivers need the most help,"" she said.

469,Trudeau says he would look at ways to improve medical assistance in dying law,"Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau said today that if he's re-elected prime minister, he'll bring in legislation to expand access to medical assistance in dying.  The Trudeau government commissioned expert panels to look at other areas of assisted death, including advance requests and extending the right to mature minors and people with severe psychiatric disorders.  Trudeau did not offer specifics today when asked how he would proceed in those areas if he's re-elected, but said he would aim to strike a balance between protecting the most vulnerable people and respecting the rights and choices of Canadians.  ""We recognize that we need to take more steps to move forward as a society. We recognized that court cases would come in, that people would be evolving as a society and that's what we've responded to,"" he told reporters after a rally in the Montreal riding of Outremont.    ""We will move forward in a responsible way with legislation that responds to that.""  Trudeau also promised to ensure the proper supports are in place for palliative care and people with disabilities, so that no one chooses to end their life because they can't get the help they need.  'Live in dignity'  ""The essential element around society is ensuring that everyone gets the supports, the treatment they need to live in dignity, and to make the choice of medical assistance in dying one that is made in a way that isn't because you're not getting the supports and cares that you actually need,"" he said.  A Quebec judge invalidated sections of the federal and Quebec laws on medically assisted dying last month, ruling that they were too restrictive and therefore unconstitutional.  Trudeau said the Liberals would review the court decision to see how the law could be improved, but that the federal government would not appeal the ruling.  The judge invalidated a Criminal Code requirement that a natural death be ""reasonably foreseeable"" before someone can be eligible for assisted death.  Trudeau said that when the legislation was introduced three years ago, he knew that various courts would rule on it and that Canadians' views on the subject would evolve.  Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer has said he would appeal the ruling so that the Supreme Court of Canada could provide certainty.",health
470,"Ontario's 'outdated' prosthetics program shortchanging amputees, critics say","A provincial program that claims to help amputees cover three-quarters of the cost of their prostheses is far falling short of that promise, according to people who have tried to access the financial aid.  On its website, the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care's assistive devices program (ADP) claims to cover ""75 per cent of the cost for equipment and supplies,"" including artificial limbs.  However, the program sets limits on the value of the devices it covers.     Amputees in Canada need health care to cover prosthetic limbs   Amputees face complicated system getting help paying for artificial limbs   How a new surgical procedure is helping some amputees walk without pain    The ADP's approved prices for limb prostheses was last reviewed in 2012, but advocacy groups including The War Amps say even then, the prices were severely out of date.  ""We think Canadians would be shocked to learn that if you lose a limb, you may not receive appropriate coverage for your artificial limbs,"" said Annelise Petlock, a lawyer with The War Amps.  Ontario lagging: reports  Petlock, who uses a prosthetic hand, said in practice the policy permits only partial coverage of the most basic prostheses.  For example, amyoelectric hand prosthesis with a simple open-and-close function like the one Petlock uses typically costs about $24,000, but the ADP's maximum contribution is currently $10,208 — less than half the actual cost.    An independent study released last fall concluded Ontario's support program for amputees is less generous than those in other high-income jurisdictions such as England, Norway, Italy and New Zealand.  The 2018 Ontario auditor general's report found the ADP ""does not have fully effective systems and procedures in place to meet the needs of Ontarians with long-term physical disabilities.""  Expensive technology  For Emilio Dutra-Lidington and his family, that reality is just starting to set in. Last August, the 19-year-old lost his right leg at the hip and all four fingers on his right hand to the propeller of a boat that plowed over him on Lac Pemichangan in western Quebec.  His recovery, including 16 surgeries, has been long and painful.      I kept having dreams where I was playing basketball, and I was moving quickly.  - Emilio Dutra-Lidington     ""I kept having dreams where I was playing basketball and I was moving quickly,"" Dutra-Lidington recalled of his hospital stay. ""Then I would wake up and be like, how would I even do that?""  Last month, Dutra-Lidington took one small but important step when he crossed the finish line of the Canada Army Run 5K, his good hand on his father's shoulder for support. The prosthetic leg he was using was a loaner from the Ottawa Hospital Rehabilitation Centre.  But chafing from the plastic socket that fits around his groin caused an uncomfortable rash, forcing him to go without the prosthesis for a few days while the skin healed.  Ideally, the teen needs an artificial limb that not only bends at the knee, but also reproduces his hip and ankle movement. The one he's borrowing now contains a microprocessor-controlled knee joint module, which by itself sells for more than $63,000.    A fraction of the cost  The Ministry of Health lists a ""Knee Unit, Swing Andu002FOr Stance Phase Control"" as having a maximum value of $4,298, toward which it will contribute 75 per cent, or $3,223.50 — a tiny fraction of the true cost.  A quote prepared for the teenager's family prices the whole prosthetic leg at $91,577, toward which the ADP would contribute just $6,792, or about seven per cent.      'They get it wrong. Even if there is a policy in place, it's often outdated.'  - Annelise Petlock, The War Amps     ""They get it wrong. Even if there is a policy in place, it's often outdated,"" Petlock said. ""As an amputee myself, it's evident that they've never spoken to an amputee in the creation of this policy,""  Compounding the problem is the fact that many insurance policies limit coverage to a single purchase, when in fact most artificial limbs need to be replaced every few years.  Deluxe model  The ministry says the kind of leg Dutra-Lidington hopes to buy is atypical, and maintains the ADP does cover a significant portion of the cost of most prostheses.  ""A microprocessor knee is not the standard type of knee prothesis used by the majority of individuals with amputations who receive funding from ADP,"" said spokesperson David Jensen.  But Petlock insists the main benefit of the microprocessor knee is added safety.   ""All that does is send a little signal to prevent the knee from snapping shut like a cheap suitcase and having you go down hard,"" she said.  Inadequate artificial limbs have also been known to cause degenerative joint disease, osteoarthritis and overuse injuries.    'You've got to just move on'  It's not clear when Dutra-Lidington will have to return the leg he's currently borrowing, or when he does, how he'll be able to afford one that works half as well.  ""You've got to just move on, you know?"" he reasoned.  After months of intense worry, Dutra-Lidington's parents are just now starting to grapple with the potential cost of the prostheses that will help restore even some of their son's former mobility.  ""As his parents, we want to try to give him those basic things back,"" said Robert Lee, the teen's step-father, who said he's been warned by prosthetists that a leg and hand ""set"" could cost as much as $250,000, and would need to be replaced every few years.  ""They're massive, they're very big costs,"" Lee said.

471,"Vaping-related lung damage in 17 patients resembled chemical burns, U.S. doctors say","Doctors studying lung tissue from people with vaping-related injuries have nearly ruled out one diagnosis as a probable explanation of how vaping harms the lungs, but the mystery over the exact cause only deepened.   Pathologists from the Mayo Clinic studied lung biopsies from 17 patients in the vaping-related outbreak that has sickened more than 800 and claimed the lives of 16 people in 13 U.S. states.  In Canada, a Quebec resident has been diagnosed as the country's first case of a severe vaping-related breathing illness.  The U.S. researchers found that none of the cases had evidence of lipoid pneumonia, a rare diagnosis typically associated with people accidentally inhaling oils into their lungs.  In the study published as a letter Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, Mayo's Dr. Brandon Larsen and colleagues found no evidence of lipoid pneumonia in any samples they studied.  They suggest that the presence of oil in the lungs may simply be a marker of vaping exposure and not the cause of vaping-related illnesses.   Their findings differ from early results of a study of five patients in North Carolina, published on Sept. 6 in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.   In those cases, doctors examined lung samples from patients with severe lung injury and found immune system cells called macrophages filled with oil. They diagnosed all five with lipoid pneumonia.   The illnesses have prompted a health scare that has led U.S. officials to urge people to stop vaping, especially products containing tetrahydrocannabinol or THC, the marijuana ingredient that produces a high. Several states have also banned some vaping products and flavourings in response to the outbreak.     Scientists have been working to understand the role of these oil-filled cells, known as lipid-laden macrophages, to help explain how vaping can cause lung injuries in otherwise healthy adults.   One possibility is that the oil is coming directly from oils inhaled in vaping devices, such as oils containing THC.   So far, 87 per cent of 86 people in Illinois and Wisconsin who got sick from vaping admitted to having used e-cigarette products containing THC, but 71 per cent also reported using nicotine-containing products.   Another theory, backed by studies in mice, is that in some patients, the fat-clogged immune cells are forming as part of the body's natural response to exposure to solvents or other chemicals used in vaping devices.    Chemical irritant   The Mayo Clinic authors said the changes in the lung samples they saw suggest that the vaping-related injuries are caused by inhaling chemical irritants, but the specific agents are not known.  Dr. Jennifer Layden, chief epidemiologist in Illinois, one of the first states to report vaping-related illnesses, said lipid-laden macrophages were not a predominant characteristic in the 53 cases described by Illinois and Wisconsin last month in the New England Journal of Medicine.   Dr. Laura Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist who studies vaping at University of California San Diego, said the Mayo findings are in line with other studies suggesting the injuries are related to toxic substances entering the lungs.   ""This is just putting further emphasis on the fact that lipoid pneumonia is not the pathologic pattern being seen in this epidemic,"" she said in an email.   Canadian health officials say anyone who has used an e-cigarette or vaping products, and has symptoms such as shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, with or without vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain or fever is advised to consult a health-care professional.  People who switched to vaping to cut down on smoking cigarettes should not go back to cigarettes, Canadian health officials said. ",health
472,"Hep C treatment is better than ever, but many Sask. patients aren't using it","It all started when one of Don Lesser's friends died of liver cancer.  ""I thought I was next,"" said Lesser, who was diagnosed with hepatitis C shortly after the death. He started his first round of treatment a few months later.  It worked for a time, but after each gruelling round, the hepatitis C came back.  For the next three-and-a-half years, he lived an existence he describes as ""hell."" Symptoms of the gruelling pill regimen can include depression, weight loss, anemia and even anorexia.  Then a new treatment came along. The pill-a-day treatment cured him in eight weeks.  Treatment for hep C is easier, faster, and cheaper than it has ever been. But one specialized hepatitis C nurse in Saskatchewan says a fraction of patients have been diagnosed and even fewer access the cure.  Saskatchewan has the highest rate of hepatitis C of any province in Canada, even as the Global Viral Hepatitis Strategy sets a goal of eliminating hepatitis C and B by 2030.      Contraction difficult to pin down  Hepatitis C is a viral disease that affects a patient's liver. People with hep C present many and varied symptoms, from fatigue and body aches to loss of appetite and diarrhea.  Lesser figured aging was responsible for his discomfort.  The only reason he was diagnosed was that his general practitioner died. During his first appointment with a new doctor, she asked him if he had ever been tested for hepatitis C.  He had never even thought about it. The test came back positive.    Lesser was put on a cocktail of drugs. That treatment takes 24 to 48 weeks, with a 60 to 70 per cent chance of cure, according to a 2015 news release from the Saskatchewan government.  Lesser says it felt like chemotherapy.  He says he lost jobs because of the stigma surrounding the viral infection. It is commonly believed that hep C is inextricably linked to injection drug use, but there are other ways to contract the virus.      Everybody is eligible. Everybody has a right to these medications.  - Nurse clinician Lesley Gallagher     It can be transmitted by shared needle use, unsterilized medical equipment and through sharing things like toothbrushes. Unsafe sex can also transmit the virus, but hugging and kissing cannot.  Lesser isn't sure how he was infected. He used intravenous drugs in the 1970s, but as far as he knows none of the friends he shared needles with were hep C positive.  Then he learned that Baby Boomers carry the highest rates of hep C.  From 1945 to 1975, inoculations and blood transfusions could have carried hepatitis C. Needles weren't always sterilized and blood wasn't screened the same way it is now.  Cure is free to patients, but underused  The newest treatment became accessible when the provincial government expanded its coverage in March 2017. Diagnosis includes a pin-prick and small blood sample to confirm hep C is in the blood.  Since 2015, the drugs Harvoni and Sovaldi have been covered. Two years later, patients gained access to Epclusa, Zepatier, Daklinza and Sunvepra.  Some patients take one pill a day, and others are on a more complex cocktail. The cure rate is similar across the board.  The duration of treatment depends on the strain of hep C, said Lesley Gallagher, hepatitis C nurse clinician at the Saskatchewan Infectious Disease Care Network.    ""Everybody is eligible. Everybody has a right to these medications,"" she said. ""There is no cost to the patient.""   The care network has set up offices across the province to educate people about hep C and to get them tested.  The situation is especially dire in the province's north, where access to health care is difficult and hep C testing is low.  In some communities, patients are likely to be reinfected after treatment because of intravenous drug use.    Methamphetamine use is also often linked to hep C.  ""There's got to be needle exchange programs,"" said Gallagher.  ""The controversial but exciting supervised injection site that's coming to Saskatoon, this is something that sets the schedule. It's a little bit behind the times compared to other cities and other provinces.""  45% diagnosed  Gallagher says education needs to reach potential patients, and it needs to start with doctors providing the test.  ""Even with health-care providers there's still a lot of education that has to happen.""  Some doctors refuse to give patients the test if they have few risk factors.  According to Gallagher, treatment numbers are expected to decrease from 2018 to 2019.  ""I don't think that actually symbolizes that we're reaching patients and treating more. I think it means that we're just not diagnosing patients enough.""    The virus's spread is growing and the care network can only work so fast to increase diagnosis and eliminate barriers to treatment. Gallagher notes that only 45 per cent of carriers are diagnosed and even fewer get to the pill regimen stage.  Lesser can't believe the lack of education around hepatitis C in the province. His goal is to end the stigma that keeps people from getting tested.  ""I kicked its ass. I'm clear,"" said Lesser. ""I feel 100 per cent better.""",health
473,"Female surgeons in Ontario earn 24% less per hour than male peers, study finds","A new study shows female surgeons in Ontario earn less per hour than their male peers, despite the province's clearly defined fee-for-service system.  The study, published today in the medical journal JAMA Surgery, analyzed data from more than 1.5 million surgical procedures claimed by 3,275 Ontario surgeons from the start of 2014 through 2016.  It found that overall, women make 24 per cent less per hour while operating, a gap linked to the types of surgeries they typically perform.  The research found women perform far fewer of the highest-paid primary procedures, and are often driven towards less lucrative specializations.  Two of the study's authors, both surgeons at Toronto's St. Michael's Hospital, say it dispels the idea that a fee-for-service system such as the Ontario Health Insurance Program eliminates gender disparities in pay.  Dr. Fahima Dossa and Dr. Nancy Baxter say it also debunks the hypothesis that female surgeons may be earning less because they work shorter hours or less efficiently.  ""Everyone's always trying to explain gender differences by pathologizing women ... 'There's something wrong with women, there's something about the way women work or the way they negotiate or the way they behave in their space,' instead of saying that the system's kind of rigged against them,"" Baxter said in an interview this week.  ""What we were trying to do is deconstruct many of the arguments and say, 'No, women are operating as quickly as men are, yet ... they end up making less per hour.""'    The pay gap persisted even after the researchers adjusted for specialty: the largest mean differences were in cardiothoracic surgery, where there was a discrepancy of $79.23 (US$59.64) per hour, and orthopedic surgery, where the gap was $73.66 (US$55.45).  Dearth of female neurosurgeons  Male surgeons also earned more hourly than female surgeons in gynecology, even though there are more women in that field, the study found. The mean difference there amounted to $22.90 (US$17.24) per hour.  When the 200 most common procedures were analyzed based on earnings per hour, the researchers found female surgeons performed more than a quarter of the least lucrative ones but less than six per cent of the highest-paid ones.    The proportion of women performing an operation dropped as the pay per hour for that procedure increased, the study shows.  The doctors say the dearth of women in certain surgical specialties limited some aspects of the research.  ""We couldn't even include neurosurgery in some of our analyses because there are under five women in the specialty,"" Baxter said.  ""In some cases, we didn't find statistical or mathematical differences between males and females, and that's because there were so few women in the specialty that our techniques for detecting the differences weren't sensitive — there were too few women to be able to make those assessments,"" Dossa added.    The study also doesn't go into why women don't have the opportunity to perform higher-paying surgeries, and Baxter and Dossa say that's something they would like to examine in the future.  Biases in the fee-setting and referral processes likely play a role, Baxter said.  ""When you look at who sets the fee codes for various procedures, in general, there aren't a lot of women at those tables. So you have men that are setting the fee codes that affect everybody,"" she said.  ""I think that there's substantial bias in that, and then there's the gamesmanship in terms of what referrals are accepted.""    It can be difficult to find surgeons willing to accept referrals for procedures that don't pay well for the time required, which means women — who typically get fewer referrals to begin with — often end up taking them on, she said.  ""They'll have to take the cases that other people turn down,"" she said.",health
474,App gives rural doctors 24\u002F7 access to medical specialists,"An app that gives small-town physicians immediate access to critical-care specialists in other parts of B.C. is having a big impact, its developer says.  The Critical Outreach and Diagnostic Intervention (CODI) video call system was recently installed in hospitals in the Peace Region of northeastern B.C., following other rural areas of the province.  Dr. Don Burke, who developed the iPhone and iPad app, says rural physicians face challenges like low resources, minimal specialist backup and few to no nurses, as well as geographic isolation.   ""There was an incredible need for this,"" Burke told Carolina de Ryk, host of Daybreak North.     Emergency room doctors in communities including Dawson Creek, Chetwynd and Tumbler Ridge can now contact specialists 24 hours a day, every day of the year. It could be to seek advice when dealing with an overdose, heart attack or a coma with unclear causes, Burke said.   ""We tried to come up with something that would be there immediately for them to take away the fear and anxiety of taking something on on your own without any backup,"" he said.    How it works  If a physician needs support, they just have to press a button on the app to be put in immediate contact with a volunteer medical specialist, who in turn have greater access to medical experts.  That specialist is just as liable for the patient's care as the doctor in the room with the patient.   ""We can walk them through whatever question they have ... whatever need they have,"" Burke said.   The app can be simply accessed through a handheld device, while some facilities, such as the ones in the Peace Region, have been mounting iPads on portable stands and connecting them to televisions for easier and clearer use.  The app stores each call and converts them into text format. Rural doctors can sort these calls through the app's archival system by using hashtags and keywords. Burke says this makes learning and consulting with past medical cases easy.    As of October, CODI has been downloaded by more than 300 doctors across B.C.  Burke says the app saves money for facilities, the Ministry of Health and taxpayers in the long-term, as fewer patients have to be airlifted out of towns and fewer doctors are needed to be recruited to replace the ones who leave small towns.   'Someone in the room who can guide you'  Dr. Stefan Du Toit, who works at the health centre in the village of Valemount, B.C., says CODI has helped his facility treat patients that normally would have to go to larger facilities.   When Du Toit is on call, it's just him and a nurse. He says that it helps to have a third ""pilot"" to control the plane when there's a critically ill patient and the situation is high stress.   ""You have tunnel vision in those situations. As a rural general practitioner, we don't deal with certain emergencies regularly enough so that we feel confident in dealing with those crises,"" said Du Toit, who has been a physician in rural areas for 20 years.   ""It's so helpful to have someone in the room who can guide you and remind you of things that are important to check.""    Burke says he is funding the project mostly by himself, with the help of some grants. But he hopes to attract more sustainable support from the province soon.",health
475,"Vaccine delays, shortages possible across Canada as flu season approaches","Medicine Shoppe pharmacist Jason Hoeppner was gearing up to hold his annual flu clinic in a few weeks.  But now he's looking at cancelling it, after the province of Manitoba notified him Wednesday there will be delays, and possibly shortages, in getting this year's flu vaccine out to providers.  That's a concern for Hoeppner.  ""We do see a lot of high-risk groups here"" at his Winnipeg pharmacy, he said.  ""Seniors, younger kids, anyone with chronic conditions — they are in those high-risk groups, so we want to make sure they get vaccinated as soon as possible.""  He says it takes about 10 to 14 days after getting the vaccine for people to build immunity. That's why it's important to get vaccinated before the flu season begins, he said, which is usually in January.    A provincial spokesperson said there are delays across the country.  ""The manufacturers that supply vaccines across all Canadian jurisdictions are experiencing shortages and delivery delays,"" the spokesperson said in an emailed statement Wednesday.  The Public Health Agency of Canada says about 55 per cent of the total flu vaccine order is currently available to distribute across the country, and it's hoping to have 90 per cent of the supply by the end of this month.    That's also a concern to Hoeppner.    ""It sounds like there is maybe a bit flu activity right now, so we'd like to get started as soon as possible as we could with this.""    In the meantime, Manitoba Health Minister Cameron Friesen says the province is working to ensure nursing homes and other high-priority areas get the vaccine.  Manitoba Health says people can minimize the risk of getting or spreading the flu virus by shielding their coughs and sneezes, washing their hands often and staying home when they are sick.  The province said it will post updates on the availability of the flu shot on its website.  ""Keep checking with whoever it is you typically get your vaccine with — your pharmacy, your doctor's office — about availability,"" Hoeppner recommends.",health

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) launched an investigation into Ryding-Regency Meat Packers Ltd. last month and suspended the company's licence on Sept. 17 for ""non-compliances related to control measures.""  The CFIA announced the recall of 102 meat products Tuesday and said in a statement the move was triggered by a food safety investigation at the facility that may result in more products being recalled.   Ryding-Regency Meat Packers said in a statement to CBC News the investigation was in relation to ""program elements that need to be enhanced and strengthened.""  ""The CFIA assisted us in identifying opportunities for improving our procedures and processes,"" said the statement provided by spokesperson Neil Brodie.    ""We are co-operating with the CFIA to ensure that all requirements are being met and that improvements are being implemented to strengthen our daily business practices.""  All of the meat products being recalled were packaged on May 27, and the company says the recall was the result of ""breakdowns in our operating procedures"" on ""isolated production days.""   ""Ryding-Regency did not knowingly release any contaminated products, and no issues have been raised by our customers,"" the company said.  ""We continue to work with CFIA at improving our business procedures and reinstating our licence.""    Ryding-Regency Meat Packers is also the largest kosher beef supplier in Canada, but no kosher meat products were identified in the recall.   Restaurants, retailers, distributors and manufacturers are being asked to check for the recalled meat and not to serve, use or sell it, according to the notice.  The CFIA did not immediately provide more details about the size and scope of the recall across the country, but said there have been no reported illnesses associated with the consumption of these products.    The company was also not able to provide the total amount of the product that has been recalled.   If more products are recalled, the public will be notified through CFIA's website.",health
477,Mayor worries New Brunswick will cut rural hospital services,"The mayor of Perth-Andover is calling on the New Brunswick government to support and strengthen services in rural hospitals across the province.  ""We're always looking to hear what the big picture plan is of a provincial government, because we really need our hospital to take care of our sick people,"" Marianne Bell said Thursday.   ""We just really want to hear a commitment from the new provincial government.""  Bell will be presenting a resolution on rural hospitals at the annual general meeting of the Union of Municipalities of New Brunswick on Saturday. She said the resolution asks the union to seek a commitment from the provincial government to maintain support for rural hospitals.     Bell said 47 per cent of people in New Brunswick live in rural areas.   ""We have strength in numbers,"" she said. ""The more of us that demonstrate the importance of our rural hospitals, the more clearly we'll be heard.""  Bell said she sent a letter to Health Minister Ted Flemming to explain why rural hospitals are important.   Flemming was not available for comment.  Premier Blaine Higgs has already warned his government could be making some unpopular decisions, including program cuts, and he identified health care as an area where he wants to see measurable improvements.     Earlier this year, Horizon Health Network closed six of its 22 beds at Perth-Andover's only hospital, Hotel-Dieu of St. Joseph, because of a registered nurse shortage. The beds were later reinstated, but Bell is worried the government will make more cuts to rural hospitals in the future.  ""People deserve timely accessible care wherever they live,"" Bell said.  She said the duplication of services between Horizon and Vitalité in cities takes away from the services in rural areas.     ""That's the elephant in the room,"" Bell said. ""The duplication of services in our province is what's costing money, inefficient waste of money compared to the high quality of care delivered in a little place like ours.""  She's hoping when she brings her resolution to municipal officials, that they'll be committed to ensuring equitable health care across the province.  ""When the people speak, usually the government needs to listen,"" Bell said. ""And we're hoping they will.""",health
478,'My mind was a dog untrained': P.E.I. woman finds hope with late-in-life ADHD diagnosis ,"Around Christmas last year, Pam Boutilier says she was feeling fed up and ""desperate.""  The 44-year-old from Charlottetown recalls spending two days combing through a list of P.E.I. psychologists she had found online. She suspected she might have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and was looking for someone who specialized in it, searching for relief.      People do not grow out of it.  — Dr. Ainslie Gray     ""I was at the end of my rope,"" Boutilier said. ""My mind was a dog untrained and it just kept going.""  Like many Islanders, Boutilier doesn't have a family doctor. She said she's been on the waiting list for more than two years.   Staying organized and on task has never been easy for Boutilier. What many take for granted as quick tasks or errands stretch into hours-long or sometimes even days-long projects.    Yet she managed to do more than cope and built a successful career.  ""It was exhausting,"" she said. ""I kind of knew for a long time I was just not fitting into the kind of world I was trying to live in.""  'Fail or wear themselves out'  ""I read tons of books on different ways to do your schedule and strategies and that sort of thing,"" she said. ""That was actually the thing that initially made me even consider ADHD.""  Last year after having some heart-to-heart conversations with a friend who has the disorder, as well as watching some YouTube videos on ADHD, Boutilier realized she might also have it.   She said before then, it was difficult to make the decision to seek treatment.   ""If someone with ADHD is told enough times by people and society at large that they are just disorganized and need to focus more, then they may just keep trying until they fail or wear themselves out,"" Boutilier said.     'A lifelong condition'  More people are being diagnosed with ADHD later in life, said Dr. Ainslie Gray. She treats adults with the disorder at the Springboard Clinic in Toronto, which diagnoses and treats both children and adults with ADHD.   She noted that about 65 per cent of patients Springboard assesses now are people 18 and over.  ADHD is one of the most common psychiatric diagnoses in children in Canada, Gray said, and affects about five per cent of Canadians — half male and half female.    ""It is a lifelong condition that is characterized by challenges with focusing and paying attention. It is not always accompanied by hyperactivity,"" Gray said, adding anxiety and sadness are also often associated with it.  ""People do not grow out of it. People learn to compensate and live with it.""  Gray said while it can make learning more challenging, ADHD is not in itself a learning disability.   Adults she sees, Gray said, often complain of anxiety and sadness and have used or abused substances to ""slow down their brain"" and ""turn off some of the noise.""    'Shame and guilt'  In addition to difficulties with focus and attention, Gray said a challenge for those with ADHD is the stigma associated with it — that people with undiagnosed ADHD are often perceived as lazy or are even viewed as lacking intelligence.   ""Often shame and guilt and 'I'm not good enough' are the emotions that may delay people from seeking support,"" said Gray. ""They may never think that ADHD is a potential.""  Women especially tend to blame themselves, she said.       The majority of girls with ADHD actually fall through the cracks.  — Dr. David Wong     ADHD can be diagnosed by either psychologists who administer psycho-educational assessments that look at a patient's learning skills and potential deficit, Gray explained, or by physicians who take patients through questionnaires.   At Springboard, assessments take about half a day and include input from a psychologist, a medical doctor and a coach-therapist, she said, and include patients and a ""significant other"" completing questionnaires.  ""Unfortunately, there are no blood tests or brain scans or any other kind of imaging yet to confirm an individual's diagnosis,"" Gray said. But, she assures, researchers are working on it.   'Just try harder'  But the road to a diagnosis can be riddled with detours and potholes.    Boutilier recalls being perceived as a lazy, dreamy child with a cluttered bedroom floor.   ""The messaging was really more that it was all my fault, if I would just try harder. And I really believed that for a very long time,"" she said.   But she was a good student who loved to learn, which she says helped her get through school relatively unscathed — but also without a diagnosis.  Another part of the stigma is that people believe ADHD is a children's disorder, Boutlier said. ""Even now it's difficult for an adult woman with ADHD. People for a long time thought it was only a young person's disorder.""     Different for girls  The way the disorder presents can be different for females than it is for males, which can lead to delayed diagnosis for women said Dr. David Wong of Summerside, who specializes in treating ADHD in adults.  Wong is a pediatrician who has spent most of his career treating ADHD in children and said he made the full transition to specializing in the disorder in adults about three months ago.       The ADHD support group has been so great because at least you get one place where people aren't judging you.  — Pam Boutilier     Wong said his desire to specialize in ADHD comes from watching a family member suffer from it their whole life, which he said has been difficult to witness.   ""Boys are more likely hyperactive and disruptive and to get into trouble in school,"" Wong said, while girls with ADHD tend to be inattentive. A small percentage of girls can be just as hyperactive as their male counterparts, he added.   ""The majority of girls with ADHD actually fall through the cracks,"" Wong said. ""Identification tends to be later for women.""     Wong said girls with ADHD are often able to get through school with less difficulty than boys but face different challenges.  ""They have problems paying attention. Problem listening to others, they have problem sitting still in meetings ... they have difficulty organizing,"" Wong said.  Wong said ADHD is more pervasive than people know, and that people with the disorder need more support.    He said in the past year he has seen 100 to 150 new adult patients and he expects that number to grow.     Island support group  When Boutilier finally found a psychologist on P.E.I. with time to see her, she was put on another waiting list, and said it was about four months before she saw someone.    Boutilier said she is now on medication for her ADHD and sees a therapist as often as she can.  What's been even more valuable to her is a support group on the Island, she said.   ""The ADHD support group has been so great because at least you get one place where people aren't judging you and we can sort of just talk.""   ADHD P.E.I. has been meeting and listening to adult Islanders living with the disorder every Wednesday since September 2018.  About eight members regularly attend meetings and a handful of others drop by periodically said Sandy Slade, the group's organizer and facilitator. He said the group is growing steadily.  ""We've had five or six people expressed interest in the last month or two about coming in,"" Slade said.    'Moving forward'  Boutilier was 43 when she was finally diagnosed last year with ADHD. She said while the road to diagnosis was long and at times frustrating, she's happy and has hope for her future.    ""I got meds and the support group and it is slow and it is still frustrating, but it's moving forward,"" she said, adding, ""medication is not a silver bullet, it's not going to fix your problems.""  Boutilier likens her mind before her diagnosis and treatment to a wall cluttered with television screens — she didn't know which one to pay attention to. Now, with the help of medication and the support group, she said she's able to zoom in and focus on just one screen.    When compared to other people with the disorder, she said she believes she's one of the lucky ones.   ""I had a successful career,"" she said. ""I think I've done better than most undiagnosed people will do.""   Boutilier switched careers. She was a veterinarian and is now a freelance illustrator, which she said better suits her.   ""There's certain things that are not ever going to be easy for me,"" she said. ""I'm feeling good, I'm feeling like I have the tools now and the knowledge to build a successful life for myself on my own terms.  ""I feel like I'm alive again.""  More P.E.I. news  ",health
479,Panel on police suicides says officers need better mental health support,"Police officers need better and clearer mental health and suicide prevention resources, recommends a report by a panel assembled by Ontario's chief coroner.  The report, released Wednesday, was written by members of the policing community and mental health professionals on the panel, which was formed after nine officers killed themselves in 2018.  Its release comes just days after an Ottawa police officer died by suicide at police headquarters on Friday.  The report stresses the need to end the stigma around mental health issues for police members, from before they are recruited, through basic training and throughout their careers, as well as for members of the public.  Police officers ""have this commitment to duty, despite the personal costs that may occur,"" said Dr. Dirk Hyer, Ontario's chief coroner.  ""[Police officers] are people who have great responsibility within our society and yet they're also under significant scrutiny and accountability for their action,"" he told CBC Radio's Ottawa Morning.  ""When they have difficulties, whether they be mental health issues or others, then it's very binary in the decision: they're fit for duty or they're not.""     Nine police officer suicides prompt review from Ontario's chief coroner   Officer who died by suicide at police HQ was 'great investigator'        When they're declared not fit for duty, he said that decision can change their identity as an officer or as a person and significantly add to their struggles.  Changing attitudes  Part of the problem stems from the fact that around 40 per cent of calls police officers attend are mental health calls, he said.  When officers are suffering, they don't want to associate themselves with the type of people they see on those calls, which leads them to deny their symptoms.  Officers can both stigmatize themselves and face stigmatization by others within their organization. But by normalizing mental health issues they can then be looked at the same as a physical injury, allowing the officers to receive treatment early and being able to return to work.  Death review committee  Among the panel's 14 recommendations is the creation of an Ontario Police Members Mental Health Collaborative, made up of people from police service boards, police associations, police officers, their family members and mental health providers.  The group would be charged with finding gaps and overlaps in the mental health support network, and report on any progress twice a year to the office of the solicitor general, who's responsible for law enforcement in Ontario.  It would also aim to work at reducing barriers for members needing immediate help, by encouraging a ""no-wrong-door"" mindset across the province where there aren't any barriers to getting mental health support.  The panel suggests the need to ensure suitable staffing, so that if an officer needs to take time off for their mental health, others aren't overworked.  Another recommendation is that the office of the chief coroner develop policy to keep track of any first-responder suicides, and hold a ""death review committee"" for each police officer.  Need for better resources  The panel found the nine offices who took their lives had one main thing in common; stop-start patterns in their treatment that lasted months or even years.  Barriers to access are a continuing problem, whether it be members working out of smaller detachments, in rural settings, when they don't have access to outside psychologists or have limited benefits.  It also found there were problems with officers being treated by clinicians with little to no expertise on policing or trauma, clinicians refusing to provide care at fees paid out by insurance companies or the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board or the affordability of mental health services in general. Furthermore, officers and their families often have to choose between short-term high quality care or longer-term ""questionable"" care, the report said.  The panel calls for universal access to quality care for police and civilian members in Ontario with mental health professionals who have knowledge of policing and trauma.   In a statement to CBC News, Solicitor General Sylvia Jones said the ministry is reviewing the panel's recommendations.  She said the province is ""committed to providing resources and supports for officers and their families,"" pointing to internal programs offered through the Ontario Provincial Police and external ones with organizations, such as Badge of Life and Wounded Warriors.  ""The brave men and women of our police services put their lives on the line each and every day to protect and serve the people of Ontario, and we are determined to do all we can to ensure they remain healthy and ready to serve.""  The OPP said in a statement that this report, its internal review of deaths by suicide and an ongoing independent review of its workplace culture will help it better support its membership.    Need help? Here are some mental health resources:     Association québécoise de prévention du suicide: 1-866-APPELLE (1-866-277-3553).   Ottawa Suicide Prevention: 613-238-3311.

480,Red meat study highlights challenges of extrapolating population-level research to individuals,"New guidelines released this week that suggest it's probably not worth giving up burgers and steak to avoid cancer and heart disease highlight longstanding flaws in nutritional research.  The crux of the problem lies in trying to apply recommendations from population-based diet studies with a large number of participants to the individual.  ""Based on the research, we cannot say with any certainty that eating red or processed meat causes cancer, diabetes or heart disease,"" said Bradley Johnston, an associate professor of community health and epidemiology at Dalhousie University in Halifax.  Johnston co-led the review of dietary recommendations around meat published in the Annals of Internal Medicine journal. He and his fellow researchers reviewed dozens of studies, some of which were based on randomized trials and others on populations of 1,000 or more adults.  The authors sought to gauge the potential impact of reducing one's weekly red or processed meat consumption by three servings. Currently, the North American average is two to four servings a week.  They found that evidence that reducing meat consumption by three servings a week impacts one's risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease is uncertain.   ""This is not a slam dunk,""said Gordon Guyatt of McMaster University in Hamilton, senior author of the review, in an interview with CBC News.   ""What we're telling people is here's the evidence. That's it. … People should be able to make their own decisions on the basis of the evidence and their values and preferences and how nutrition, what they eat, affects their lives.""     How risky is eating red meat? New studies provoke controversy    For Guyatt, previous reviews based on population studies that informed the current Canada Food Guide aren't accurate enough to say people should cut down on red meat.   For consumers looking to nutritional science for guidance on how to eat, the many uncertainties and variables, including age, genetics, education levels and access to health services, also confound researchers looking for a clear signal from studies tracking heart disease and cancer rates.  Randomized controlled trials in which people are given certain food and compared against similar people who aren't exposed to the food are the only way to go beyond mere associations — that is, from ""eating red meat might raise cancer risk"" to ""eating red meat is a cause of cancer.""    While the carcinogenic effects of tobacco are huge and obvious, that's much harder to see for dietary factors.   That's even more so when researchers give people questionnaires and ask them to remember what they ate for a week. The answers are ""essentially a guess,"" said Christopher Labos, a cardiologist in Montreal.   'Irresponsible and unethical'?  Critics of the review, such as Frank Hu, chair of the nutrition department at Harvard School of Public Health, said there are major flaws with the new analysis.  ""From a public health point of view, it is irresponsible and unethical to issue dietary guidelines that are tantamount to promoting meat consumption, even if there is still some uncertainty about the strength of the evidence,"" Hu said in a statement.  Hu also said the guidelines are inconsistent with the medical principle of ""first, do no harm."" For Hu, it's irresponsible to tell a patient eating two servings of red or processed meat a day to continue doing so.  Existing recommendations are based on evidence from randomized controlled trials for cardiovascular outcomes and population studies evaluating cancer and Type 2 diabetes risks and mortality for some other conditions, Hu's Harvard team said.  No single answer  For Sean Wharton, a Toronto internal medicine specialist focused on obesity and Type 2 diabetes, diets need to be individualized.  ""It's very challenging for anyone to say that this regimen is what you should have for the entire population,"" Wharton said. ""We've always known that intuitively. We're trying to reduce everything to one answer: you should have red meat or you shouldn't have red meat. Neither of those are right.""  Rather, Wharton said, go with what's healthy for you, based on parameters such as cholesterol, blood sugar, being able to move easily and feeling healthy.    Specific dietary regimens are suited to certain patients, such as an no gluten for someone with celiac disease, he said.  As for looking to research for answers, Labos said it is worthwhile to review the evidence because conventional wisdom changes over time.  The problem for those in the field of nutritional epidemiology is they ""either need to produce good data or we need to stop arguing about these things.""   ""You have to worry about public apathy,"" Labos said.    ""For example, that one day eggs are good for you and the next day eggs are bad for you. Eventually, the public is going to  say ... 'I'm going to stop listening,' and that becomes problematic when you want to say something very important.""  For his part, Guyatt said he eschews red and processed meat for animal welfare and environmental reasons. The latest review did not consider those perspectives.",health
481,"No 'significant risk' to children from chiropractic therapy, B.C. college says","B.C. chiropractors will not be restricted from using spinal manipulative therapy on children, following a two-month review by their professional college.  The College of Chiropractors of B.C. launched the review in July, promising an ""exhaustive"" analysis of the available research on the use of the therapy in children younger than 10. That project was wrapped up in time for the most recent college board meeting on Sept. 25, according to a public notice posted online.  ""After considering all of the available evidence, including an independent research review, the board has determined that the treatment of children with SMT [spinal manipulative therapy] does not present a significant risk to the public,"" the notice said.  The college said it ""remains vigilant"" and will keep an eye on new research on the subject, but it's not taking any action at this point.    Spinal manipulative therapy is when a chiropractor applies force to a joint of the spine, causing it to move more than it normally would.  'It's disappointing'  Tim Caulfield, research director at the University of Alberta's Health Law Institute, said he wasn't surprised the college isn't taking action, but he's still disappointed.  ""You could see why an organization that is trying to support the practise of its members would come to this result, but it's disappointing because I don't think the body of evidence supports that conclusion,"" Caulfield told CBC.    He acknowledged that in his reviews of the available research, he hasn't seen much robust evidence about the risks of spinal manipulation for children. But he said he hasn't seen much evidence suggesting the therapy is helpful, either.  ""Consider the fact that the harms associated with it, while perhaps speculative, are nevertheless possible,"" Caulfield said.  ""Given the lack of evidence of efficacy, given the possibility of harm, I'm disappointed.""    He said he would have liked to see the college follow the lead of Australia, where the country's chiropractic board has placed a moratorium on using spinal manipulation on anyone under the age of two.  According to a position paper from the Canadian Pediatric Society, there have been no satisfactory studies of chiropractic treatments for back pain in children. Some studies have suggested that chiropractic manipulation of the neck can provide short-term relief of neck pain in children, but its efficacy hasn't been compared to other therapies, the paper says.    Over the last year, the B.C. college has been cracking down on chiropractors making unsupported and unscientific claims about how their therapies can help patients, including children.  The college has formally banned all chiropractors from making claims about being able to treat a range of conditions, including autism, ADHD, speech disorders and infections ""due to the absence of acceptable evidence.""",health
482,Juul ends attempt to overturn San Francisco anti-vaping law,"Juul Labs Inc. announced Monday that it will stop supporting a ballot measure to overturn an anti-vaping law in San Francisco, effectively killing the campaign.  The largest U.S. maker of e-cigarettes said it will end its support for Proposition C after donating nearly $19 million US. It was virtually the only financial backer of the measure.  ""Based on that news, we have made the decision not to continue on with the campaign,"" Yes on C said in a statement.  However, the proposition will still appear on the November ballot.  Proposition C would have allowed the sale of vape products to adults, partially overturning the city's June ordinance that as of next year would ban sales of e-cigarettes and vape products not reviewed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  The move was part of a broad review of company policies in the wake of a leadership shakeup.  ""I am committed to seeing that Juul engages productively with all stakeholders, including regulators, policymakers and our customers,"" newly appointed chief executive officer K.C. Crosthwaite said in a statement. ""This decision does not change the fact that as a San Francisco-founded and headquartered company we remain committed to the city.""    However, Larry Tramutola, who directs the No on Prop C campaign, was skeptical, noting that about $7 million in Juul's campaign donations remain unspent.  ""This could very well be yet another of a series of lies and exaggerations from Juul and Big Tobacco,"" he said in a statement.  ""Until they return the $7 million unspent dollars that is in their political account, until they suspend their mail, their advertising, their paid phone calls and lay off their consultants we do not believe them.""  The move came as a 14th U.S. death linked to vaping was reported in Nebraska. Hundreds of people have suffered lung ailments tied to vaping, although no major e-cigarette company has been linked to them and many patients said they vaped products that included THC, the intoxicating chemical in marijuana.    Even so, critics contend that vaping products are being marketed to minors through the use of social media popular with teens and the production of candy- and fruit-flavoured vaping capsules.  Last month, India banned the sale and import of electronic cigarettes, warning of a vaping ""epidemic"" among young people and dashing plans of companies such as Juul and Philip Morris International to sell products in the country.  Juul had aimed to launch its e-cigarette in India in late 2019 and had hired several senior executives in recent months, Reuters has previously reported.    Washington announced Tuesday it is joining several other states in banning the sale of flavoured vaping products amid concern over the mysterious lung illness that has sickened hundreds of people and killed about a dozen across the country.  Michigan, New York and Rhode Island also recently banned flavoured vaping products. President Donald Trump has said that the federal government would act to prohibit thousands of flavours used in e-cigarettes because they appeal to underage users.  Juul has said it doesn't market to young people, and its products are meant to be an alternative to smoking. However, the company's advertising is under federal investigation, and the company recently announced it will stop advertising its e-cigarettes in the U.S.    E-cigarettes have been largely unregulated since arriving in the U.S. in 2007. The Food and Drug Administration has set next May as a deadline for manufacturers to submit their products for review.  Health experts generally consider e-cigarettes less harmful than traditional cigarettes, because they don't contain all the cancer-causing byproducts of burning tobacco. But there's virtually no long-term research on the health effects of the vapour produced when e-cigarettes heat a liquid with nicotine.  With files from Reuters",health
483,How risky is eating red meat? New studies provoke controversy,"Eating red meat is linked to cancer and heart disease, but are the risks big enough to give up burgers and steak?  A team of international researchers says probably not, contradicting established advice. In a series of papers published Monday, the researchers say the increased risks are small and uncertain and that cutting back likely wouldn't be worth it for people who enjoy meat.  Their conclusions were swiftly attacked by a group of prominent U.S. scientists who took the unusual step of trying to stop publication until their criticisms were addressed.  The new work does not say red meat and processed meats like hot dogs and bacon are healthy or that people should eat more of them. The reviews of past studies generally support the ties to cancer, heart disease and other bad health outcomes. But the authors say the evidence is weak, and that there's not much certainty meat is really the culprit, since other diet and lifestyle factors could be at play.   Most people who understand the magnitude of the risks would say, ""Thanks very much, but I'm going to keep eating my meat,"" said co-author Dr. Gordon Guyatt of McMaster University in Hamilton.  It's the latest example of how divisive nutrition research has become, with its uncertainties leaving the door open for conflicting advice. Critics say findings often aren't backed by strong evidence. Defenders counter that nutrition studies can rarely be conclusive because of the difficulty of measuring the effects of any single food, but that methods have improved.  ""What we need to do is look at the weight of evidence — that's what courts of law use,"" said Dr. Walter Willett, a professor of nutrition at Harvard University who was among those calling for the papers' publication to be postponed.  Willett, who has led studies tying meat to bad health outcomes, also said the reviews do not consider the particularly pronounced benefits of switching from red meat to vegetarian options.  Guyatt still avoids red meat for environmental reasons  The journal, Annals of Internal Medicine, defended the work and said the request to have it pulled before publication is not how scientific discourse is supposed to happen. Guyatt called the attempt to halt publication ""silly.""  In the papers, the authors sought to gauge the potential impact of eating less meat, noting the average of two to four servings a week eaten in North America and Western Europe. They said the evidence for cutting back wasn't compelling. For example, they found that cutting three servings of red meat a week would result in seven fewer cancer deaths per 1,000 people.  Based on the analyses, a panel of the international researchers said people do not have to cut back for health reasons. But they note their own advice is weak and that they didn't take into account other factors, such as animal welfare and the toll meat production has on the environment.     There was dissent even among the authors; three of the 14 panellists said they support reducing red and processed meats. A co-author of one review is also among those who called for a publication delay.  Those who pushed to postpone publication also questioned why certain studies were included or excluded in the reviews. Harvard's Dr. Frank Hu also noted that about a third of American adults eat at least one serving of red meat a day. He said the benefits of cutting back would be larger for those who eat such high amounts.  Still, other researchers not involved in the reviews have criticized nutrition science for producing weak and conflicting findings. Dr. John Ioannidis, a professor of medicine at Stanford University, said such advice can distract from clearer, more effective messages, such as limiting how much we eat.  As for his own diet, Guyatt said he no longer thinks red or processed meats have significant health risks. But he said he still avoids them out of habit, and for animal welfare and environmental reasons.",health
484,"Young caregivers put future careers at risk, study shows ","Caring for their mother, who had dementia, forever changed the lives of Edmonton sisters Elise and Sarah Chamberland.   ""I wasn't really focused on my own life because I was thinking about all the work I had to do for her, and also thinking, 'I don't have a lot of time left with her,' "" Elise Chamberland said.  ""It impacts every aspect of your life.""  One in four Canadians aged 15 to 19 helps someone with challenges resulting from illness, disability or aging, according to University of Alberta researchers. Most are in school, and 60 per cent of young caregivers also work.  While 47 per cent of young caregivers spend less than two hours per week providing care, four per cent provide care 11 to 20 hours per week and six per cent spend more than 21 hours a week helping someone else. The average is six hours per week.  Prof. Janet Fast and her team in the Department of Human Ecology analyzed data from a 2012 Statistics Canada survey of caregivers. Their study was published Tuesday on the U of A's Research and Aging Policies and Practice website.    Many of them start early,"" Fast said. ""Many of them care for a very long time, and they move in and out of caregiving episodes across their entire life course.""  The Chamberland sisters — Elise, now 31, and Sarah, now 28 — cared for their mother Carrie for about 10 years until she died in June at age 58.  ""She was always in the back of my mind. Every decision I made, everything I did,"" Sarah said.  With the help of their father, Claude, Elise and Sarah looked after every detail of Carrie's life.   ""Near the end, we were standing outside the shower, reminding her of what she had to do,"" Elise said.         'The crisis is already here': Advocates say unpaid caregiving should be an election priority   Young caregivers need support as numbers grow, University of Waterloo researcher says    The research by Fast and her team shows that young caregivers' education, health, relationships and paid jobs are all affected by their added responsibilities.  Caregiving came at a cost for the Chamberland sisters.  ""My career took a completely different trajectory because of it all,"" said Elise, who quit her studies in architecture to move back to Edmonton when her mother's symptoms worsened.   Sarah delayed purchasing a home for years and worried about the emotional and financial impacts of her decision.   ""There was a lot of guilt involved,"" she said. ""It was kind of risky because I always feared that one day I would maybe have to stop working because I needed to be a full-time caregiver.""  Elise and Sarah's caregiving journey became more complicated three years ago when their father was diagnosed with cancer.       I always feared that one day I would maybe have to stop working because I needed to be a full-time caregiver.  - Sarah Chamberland     The sisters cared for both parents for a six-month period.   ""It's hard to believe we even survived it, to be honest, because it was awful,"" said Sarah, who took a leave from her nursing career during that time.  Elise was finishing up her studies in social work and quit her part-time job to dedicate more time to her parents.  Claude Chamberland recovered from his cancer and is in remission.    Those types of sacrifices are common for caregivers, and those who start their caregiving careers early face cumulative effects, Fast said.  Young caregivers who were surveyed by Statistics Canada reported having difficulty concentrating in school and less time for studying, putting their future job prospects at risk.  ""They may not have an opportunity to get into post-secondary education, which will impact their employability,"" Fast said.  ""That can have repercussions for their entire life course.""  'Stressed and anxious'  Caregiving also affects young people's personal development, research shows, because their time and energy are focused elsewhere.  ""Social life was difficult because you have to be able to be home at certain times and you're tired,"" Elise said.   ""It's hard to build a relationship because you don't have a lot of time. Your priorities are a little bit different.""     Crucial for health system, many caregivers are struggling financially and emotionally    One in three young caregivers reported feeling overwhelmed, a reality that is also well-documented in the general caregiving population.  ""Most people are in the workforce, attempting to manage this role,"" said Johnna Lowther, provincial program lead with Caregivers Alberta, an organization that supports and educates caregivers.  ""They report feeling stressed and anxious, they report feeling isolated.""  There are close to one million caregivers in Alberta. They spend an average of nine hours a week looking after others, according to another analysis by the U of A research team.  Support can make difference  Caregivers play a crucial role in society, Lowther said.  Other research from Fast and her team shows caregivers save the Alberta health-care system an estimated $5.8 billion each year.  ""They're not accessing emergency care, they're not going to the doctor as much,"" she said. ""They're putting off going into [a] long-term care setting or supported living.""  Caregivers need more access to respite care and financial support to help loved ones while staying in the workforce, said Lowther.  ""It would be great to see some government financial assistance that supports the labour hours of that caregiving role.""     More support needed for unpaid caregivers in Canada    Looking back, Sarah and Elise Chamberland believe financial help could have helped them take better care of their mother.  ""To have that financial backing would have meant that I could have focused solely on her,"" Elise said.  ""It would have taken the stress out of it,"" added Sarah.   Despite the challenges, the sisters wouldn't hesitate to do it all over again.   ""Not a lot of people get to experience the closeness that we got with our mom,"" Sarah said, adding it was a blessing to be able to spend the time with her.  ""It feels nice to be able to care for someone who cared for you when you were little,"" added Elise. ""It came full circle.""",health

Five drugmakers battling the cases — Endo, J&amp;J, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Allergan Plc. and Mallinckrodt Plc. — are looking to enact a global settlement of the litigation that would be implemented through Purdue's Chapter 11 case, the WSJ reported, citing a person familiar with the matter.  The mechanism, if successful, would allow the companies to contribute money into a trust set up through the bankruptcy in exchange for a complete release from liability, according to the report.   OxyContin maker Purdue filed for bankruptcy protection in September, succumbing to pressure from more than 2,600 lawsuits alleging the company helped fuel the deadly U.S. opioid epidemic.    Mallinckrodt said the report that it was seeking to leverage the Purdue bankruptcy was ""completely unfounded.""

486,'Understanding trauma': Program shows doctors the biases Indigenous women experience,"An online training program is aiming to educate health-care professionals about biases Indigenous women may experience as highlighted by allegations of recent coerced sterilizations.  Dr. Naana Jumah, an obstetrician-gynecologist at the Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre and assistant professor at the Northern Ontario School of Medicine, said the idea for the program came in 2011 when she was doing her residency.  ""It originally started as a project to understand what residents in obstetrics and gynecology knew about Indigenous women's health and ... I also asked program directors across Canada what resources they had and what expertise they had to provide a curriculum,"" Jumah said.  ""Residents really didn't have an understanding, but they were interested. And program directors wanted to provide a curriculum, but they didn't have the resources, the know-how and the contacts in the community to do that.""  The program, which started Tuesday, incorporates feedback from 11 Indigenous women's organizations from across Canada. Jumah also worked with Dr. Lisa Richardson, a strategic adviser in Indigenous Health at the University of Toronto's Faculty of Medicine and an associate professor in the Department of Medicine. They led a research team of mostly Indigenous women to develop the curriculum.    ""It asks the person who is taking it to really critically look at themselves and understand who they are and their biases,"" said Jumah.  It also includes information on traditional healing and Indigenous history such as residential schools and the '60s Scoop.  Jumah said she hopes the training can also be used in other areas such as law.  ""These women opened my eyes to the fact that this isn't a journey about medicine or medical practice,"" Jumah said. ""It's really about exploring our relationships with each other as Canadians and how we got to be in the situation that we're in today.""  'Major breaches'  Richardson, who is Indigenous, said the program is important because ""there continues to be major breaches in terms of Indigenous women's health.""  In December, the United Nations committee against torture demanded Canada stop forced or coerced sterilization of Indigenous women and girls. The House of Commons health committee has also heard of Indigenous women alleging they were coerced into sterilization after childbirth. A class-action lawsuit alleges one woman believed she had no choice but to sign a consent form moments after receiving an epidural at a Saskatchewan hospital in 2018.  ""The program isn't specifically about forced sterilization, but of course the underpinning of understanding trauma and why trauma-informed care is important,"" Richardson said.  ""Going into a hospital environment can be traumatic, particularly if you are hearing ongoing stories from your auntie, your sister, your mother or your friends who continue to experience this violence.""    Wanda Phillips-Beck, a Winnipeg-based Indigenous scholar and researcher with the First Nation Health and Social Secretariat of Manitoba, said the online program is a good start, but much more needs to be done.  Phillips-Beck said cultures are diverse and health-care providers need to build relationships with communities around them.  ""For women in rural and remote communities in Manitoba, they have to leave home to give birth and, up until very recently, they weren't allowed to bring their significant others with them,"" she said. ""So there is a great deal of potential for many negative experiences.""  ""They have no family support, English may not be their first language, so miscommunication can occur.""  She said health-care providers must also spend time with elders and be informed about how traditional medicine can contribute to the well-being of Indigenous people.  Yolanda Wanakamik, a student at Lakehead University who worked on the program, said nothing in the study about racism that Indigenous women face in health care was surprising.  ""What did surprise us is just how much of an impact it had on the women who were seeing people who were truly looking at building a relationship with them,"" said Wanakamik, who is Anishnawbe and from the Thunder Bay, Ont., area.  ""[The program] isn't going to answer all the questions and educate everyone. But the beauty of it is that it does come from an Indigenous women's perspective.""",health
487,"Lawsuit filed in B.C. Supreme Court seeks class action, damages against e-cigarette giant Juul","A notice of civil claim filed in B.C. Supreme Court claims e-cigarette giant Juul targets minors with misleading advertising by claiming its products are safer and healthier than smoking.   In documents filed today naming Juul Labs Canada and Juul Labs Inc., plaintiffs Jaycen Stephens and Owen Mann-Campbell say they were 18 years old when they started using Juul e-cigarettes in 2018.  Both say they developed shortness of breath, chest pain, coughing, increased addiction to nicotine, anxiety and other harms, which their doctors connected to vaping.  The men claim they would not have bought or used Juul e-cigarettes had they ""been provided with accurate information andu002For warnings with respect to the possible health complications from vaping.""    The plaintiffs are seeking to have the lawsuit classified as a class action. None of the allegations has been tested in court.  In an emailed statement, Juul Labs Canada told CBC News, ""We are currently reviewing the statement of claim and at this time are not able to provide any further comment.""  Juul products account for about three-quarters of all sales in the multibillion-dollar industry.    Last week, the CEO of Juul Labs Inc. abruptly stepped down and the company announced it was suspending all TV, print and digital advertising in the United States, but not in Canada.  The San Francisco-based company advertises in Canada on various platforms and has employed lobbyists to meet with politicians to try to influence policy numerous times in the past year, according to the federal registry of officially recognized lobbyists.    Juul has been under fire recently after a spate of lung-related illnesses among people who vape.  Earlier this month, Health Canada issued a warning about the connections between vaping and pulmonary illness, and last week a Quebec resident was diagnosed with the nation's first case of severe vaping-related breathing illness.     The U.S. Centers for Disease Control says 12 vaping-related deaths have been confirmed in 10 states.  Originally touted as a smoking cessation tool, the vaping industry has been criticized for seemingly getting an entirely new generation of young people hooked on nicotine.    Juul became a hit largely because its tobacco pods have a higher nicotine content than other comparable products and, in the U.S, a wide variety of fruit and dessert flavours.  Product selection in Canada is more limited but still offers tobacco pod flavours like mint, mango and vanilla.",health
488,U of T students demand change in wake of suicide on campus,"Twenty-four students at the University of Toronto are calling on the school to improve its mental health services  immediately after a student died by suicide in a computer science building on Friday.  Loizza Aquino, a third year student, and Ashwini Selvakumaran, a second year student, say they have formed a new advocacy group, UofThrive, to give students a voice. The group is already organizing its first event for Thursday, Oct. 10 to coincide with World Mental Health Day.   Aquino, who is taking mental health and international development studies, said the group wants to create awareness surrounding mental health at U of T in the wake of the suicide. She noted the group was formed by 24 students in 24 hours. Group members come from all three U of T campuses in downtown Toronto, Scarborough and Mississauga.   According to Aquino, UofThrive is already taking applications for speakers and performers of its first event.  ""I think our main goal right now is to start a conversation on campus, across all three of them, and also to eliminate and eradicate the ... kind of culture that we have around being a student at the University of Toronto,"" Aquino said on Monday.  ""You are not supposed to eat, you are not supposed to sleep, you are not supposed to take care of yourself, and that's what we equate with success.""  The demand for change comes after the university announced on Sunday that it has installed temporary safety barriers at the Bahen Centre for Information Technology, where the death occurred.    Toronto police have confirmed that they were called to the school at 6:30 p.m. on Friday for a medical call related to a death that was not criminal in nature. Toronto paramedics have confirmed that a death occurred on campus.  In a tweet on Saturday, the school confirmed that a student died on campus. The student's name, sex and age, year and faculty have not been released.     Wait times for counselling too long, students say  Aquino and Selvakumaran say wait times at the U of T Health and Wellness Centre, St. George, which provides counselling for students, are too long, especially for students in crisis. CBC Toronto has asked the centre to respond to their concerns, but it has not yet received a response.    In an Instagram post on the weekend, Aquino says there is a need for more talk about mental health, better resources and services. She pointed out that the school has lost a student to suicide less than a month after school year started.  In an interview with CBC Toronto on Monday, she said the lack of conversation about mental health means students who are suffering do not necessarily know where to get help or how to talk about such problems as depression, anxiety and feeling overwhelmed.  International students may face a language or cultural barrier, she added. ""They're in a new country. They might not know where exactly to reach out for help,"" she said.  Selvakumaran, who is taking peace, conflict and justice studies, said many students have already expressed support for the group.  ""We all really had a like-minded goal to establish a platform where our students at our university feel reassured and supported ... So many students have come up to us to tell us how grateful they are for this initiative and it's only been a little over 24 hours,"" she said on Monday.    Selvakumaran said typically, U of T students feel pressured to be successful academically and in terms of extracurricular activities. She said students have limited time for themselves but mental health is crucial for well-being.  She said she herself had to wait for months for counselling at the U of T Health and Wellness Centre. In her first year, she felt overwhelmed by academic pressure and a lack of social support. She sent a request to the centre in March for an appointment but did not receive a response until the summer.   ""Personally, I found it very difficult to access any of the resources I could at the University of Toronto and I had to turn to other support systems like my family and friends,"" she said.  ""While I'm lucky to have a strong support system, many students at this university don't have that, specifically international students who are so far away from home.""  The group, UofThrive, hopes to change that by creating a new ""support community,"" she added.  'This needs to be addressed'  Samer Henry, a PhD engineering student and teaching assistant, said he was in a meeting for teaching assistants in the computer science building on Friday. He said he and other students were escorted out by Toronto police and paramedics.    ""It was the first time for pretty much all of us to be this close and feeling that this is so real and this is a big problem. This needs to be addressed,"" he said.  Henry said he offered crisis support for the other teaching assistants there but he sought help on Saturday at the health and wellness centre.  Henry said he was shocked but has a message for students in crisis: ""Go to the resources. Go to the health and wellness centre. Reach out in any way or form. You should not be alone. If you feel that you would like to talk to someone, there are people who would be willing to hear you out.""",health
489,MUHC systems back up and running after major computer breakdown,"The McGill University Health Centre (MUHC) is investigating the cause of a computer system failure Monday that forced the hospital to cancel all clinical appointments for the day and ask patients in need of emergency services to go elsewhere.  The MUHC said the failure occurred at 11:30 a.m. Monday. Shortly before 1 p.m., the hospital tweeted that its computer systems were gradually returning to normal.  By 5 p.m., MUHC's emergency departments began receiving ambulances once again, and at 6:37 p.m. the MUHC tweeted that the problem that caused the failure was resolved.     No signs of a hack  The MUHC's director of professional services, Ewa Sidorowicz, told reporters Monday afternoon the exact cause of the system failure is still being investigated — but it doesn't look like a hack is to blame.   The problems appear to have been due to faulty equipment, said Sidorowicz.  The failure affected all sites in the MUHC network — including the Montreal General, the Childrens' Hospital and other buildings at the Glen site, as well as Lachine Hospital, said Sidorowicz.    In addition to clinical appointments, some surgeries at the MUHC had to be cancelled, and most ambulances that arrived at the MUHC were redirected to other hospitals.   This is the first system failure of this magnitude at the MUHC, said Sidorowicz, and the hospital went into paper mode to deal with the problem.  Sidorwicz said the system is rebooting now and should be back up later in the day.   ",health
490,Meet a guy who converts gas-guzzling cars into electric vehicles ,"Hello, people! This is our weekly newsletter on all things environmental, where we highlight trends and solutions that are moving us to a more sustainable world. (Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Thursday.)  This week:     Meet a guy who converts gas-guzzling cars into electric vehicles    Which countries have the most tree cover?   How scientist and 'Champion of the Earth' Katharine Hayhoe deals with climate skeptics      This Toronto businessman retrofits classic cars with electric motors    When Davinder Singh was in high school, around the turn of the millennium, he couldn't wait for B.C.-based Ballard Power Systems to come out with its hydrogen fuel cell. At the time, he believed his first car would be, as he put it, ""water-powered.""  That didn't happen, and he ended up buying — and fixing — a series of gas-powered cars. ""They were always, constantly, breaking down, these combustion vehicles,"" Singh said.  At some point, he asked himself: Why don't I go electric? This was 2010, and the Tesla Roadster was available. But it was priced at around $100,000 and was out of Singh's reach. He said other available electric vehicle (EV) options ""were not desirable.""  That's when the Toronto-based entrepreneur said he started ""scheming"" on a plan: converting a gas guzzler into an electric vehicle. Singh went from studying cell biology and working in the pharmaceutical industry to learning everything there was about the design and engineering of e-cars.   In 2012, he successfully retrofitted his 1985 Jaguar XJ6. Singh now runs Epic Car Conversions, which specializes in converting internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles into 100 per cent EVs.  The company has retrofitted about 40 vehicles, mostly high-end vintage cars, including Porsches and other Jaguars.  Epic removes all the combustion components of the vehicle, from the engine to the fuel tank to the exhaust, and custom builds an electric drive unit specific to the car being retrofitted. It includes assembling a motor, inverter, battery pack and charger. It's a simplified unit that requires very little maintenance, said Singh. ""You will not have to see your mechanic ever for oil changes, spark plugs or tune-ups.""   Singh has a team of about 10 people, including mechanics and machinists, and the retrofitting process can take about two months — depending on the amount of customization involved, it can take longer.  Because each retrofit must be custom-built ""from scratch,"" the switch isn't cheap. Singh said prices range from about $25,000 for a battery with a 100-kilometre range (good for city driving) to $45,000 for a 250-km battery. He said some builds can be more than $85,000, but those are rare and typically include more range and customized paint jobs.  The high cost poses a challenge, said Singh, because his company is competing with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) like Tesla, Nissan and Ford — companies that buy and build EVs in bulk. He said Epic's advantage is its ability to customize any car.  And it's looking to branch out. With help from the Canadian government, Singh's startup has made connections in places like Thailand and India, where Singh has been promoting Epic's electric-drive unit for use in vehicle fleets (like company cars or buses). He's also had conversations with a municipality in the Greater Toronto Area.  Keeping maintenance and fuel costs low is the reason Singh started on this journey. But helping cut carbon emissions is also important for this father of one.   ""If we have more electric vehicles on the road … we'll have cleaner air for the next generation.""  — Nazima Walji    Reader feedback  Last Friday, an estimated seven million people came out worldwide to demonstrate for climate action, led by Swedish teen Greta Thunberg, who joined 500,000 protesters in Montreal. Do you think the ongoing climate strikes will have an impact on the Canadian election?  Email us at whatonearth@cbc.ca.  Old issues of What on Earth? are right here.      The Big Picture: The cheapest forms of energy, by country  Trees are key to fighting climate change, but industrial development and urbanization over the last couple of centuries have reduced the size of forests in parts of the world. Many countries have recognized the problem and have acted accordingly — China and India, for example, have undertaken aggressive tree-planting campaigns. The graph below captures the countries with the most tree cover — i.e. the percentage of their landmass covered by trees. Suriname, a country of about 550,000 people in South America, comes out on top. We also included some more populated countries underneath as a point of comparison.    Hot and bothered: Provocative ideas from around the web      The British Isles get a lot of wind, and they've used that natural endowment to produce a lot of renewable energy. Now, General Electric is installing the world's largest turbines (260 metres tall) in an area off the Yorkshire coast called Dogger Bank, soon to be the world's largest wind farm.     A Guardian article explores the idea of ""secret sustainability"" — namely, companies that have managed to make their manufacturing processes more energy- or resource-efficient, and thus better for the planet, but haven't gone public about it.       'We're looking for common ground': Canadian scientist and 'Champion of the Earth' on talking to climate skeptics    Katharine Hayhoe is a Canadian climate scientist with a big voice. A professor at Texas Tech University's department of political science and director of the university's Climate Center, Hayhoe has been fervent in communicating the challenges and reality of climate change, as well as the solutions to limiting global warming to 2 C above the pre-industrial average.  Hayhoe's work recently earned her the United Nations 2019 Champions of the Earth award. Nicole Mortillaro spoke to her about the challenges of communicating the realities of climate change.  What are the biggest hurdles for you in getting the message out about climate change?  There is a massively funded and very intelligent disinformation campaign that is trying to muddy the waters on everything that we do. So it is really kind of like the Girl Guides trying to fight the Marines here.  When we first started, we [were] naive. We thought, well, surely the truth will win if we just tell people the truth. But it's such a highly politically polarized topic. And sadly, it isn't just limited to the U.S. anymore. In Canada, it's becoming increasingly politically polarized as well.   Why do you think it's become politicized?  It's become politicized because, if you go to Wikipedia and you just run your eyes down the list of the richest corporations in the world, No. 1 is Walmart. After Walmart, you have petroleum, petroleum, petroleum, energy, energy, petroleum, petroleum, energy, petroleum. So, we are talking about solutions that are overall beneficial for almost everybody on this planet, with one exception. And the one exception are the industries that currently hold the balance of power and wealth in this world.  Can you change people's minds with facts?  Facts are not what change people's minds because people have made the rejection of climate change part of their personal identity. And so changing their mind about climate change would require them to change their idea of who they are…   People don't truly have a problem with basic science, because if they did, they would also be rejecting stoves and fridges and airplanes. What they have a problem with is not the actual science. They have a problem with the perceived solution. We see the solution to be liberal, to be socialist, to be — as [former prime minister Stephen] Harper famously put it — the economy versus the environment. We see the only solutions to be harmful and punitive and potentially even worse than the impact, especially in Canada, where many people feel, ""Isn't warmer better?""  But the reality is, there are many solutions that are extremely beneficial, that help us improve air quality, reduce our water use, grow the economy, grow local jobs.   What bothers you the most about climate change science communication?  If we want to have constructive, positive conversations that move the dialogue along, we have to begin that conversation with what we most agree with, with that person, or those people or that organization, rather than what we disagree with her about. Not the Bill Nye approach, but rather the approach where we're looking for common ground.  Those of us who are doing it, it is not part of our job description. It is not part of our daily routine, it is something that we're doing … above and beyond what we're actually doing in terms of our teaching and our research and our service. And it is a woefully, woefully under-supported and underfunded initiative.  This interview has been edited and condensed.    Stay in touch!  Are there issues you'd like us to cover? Questions you want answered? Do you just want to share a kind word? We'd love to hear from you. Email us at whatonearth@cbc.ca.  Sign up here to get What on Earth? in your inbox every Thursday.

491,Paralyzed man walks using brain-controlled exoskeleton,"A man paralyzed from the shoulders down has been able to walk using a pioneering four-limb robotic system, or exoskeleton, that is commanded and controlled by signals from his brain.  With a ceiling-mounted harness for balance, the 28-year-old tetraplegic patient used a system of sensors implanted near his brain to send messages to move all four of his paralyzed limbs after a two-year-long trial of the whole-body exoskeleton.  The results, published in The Lancet Neurology journal on Thursday, bring doctors a step closer to one day being able to help paralyzed patients drive computers using brain signals alone, according to researchers who led the work.  But for now the exoskeleton is purely an experimental prototype and is ""far from clinical application,"" they added.  ""[This] is the first semi-invasive wireless brain-computer system designed … to activate all four limbs,"" said Alim-Louis Benabid, a neurosurgeon and professor at the University of Grenoble, France, who co-led the trial.  He said previous brain-computer technologies have used invasive sensors implanted in the brain, where they can be more dangerous and often stop working. Previous versions have also been connected to wires, he said, or have been limited to creating movement in just one limb.  Watch the exoskeleton at work    In this trial, two recording devices were implanted, one either side of the patient's head between the brain and the skin, spanning the sensorimotor cortex region of the brain that controls sensation and motor function.    Each recorder contained 64 electrodes which collected brain signals and transmitted them to a decoding algorithm. The system translated the brain signals into the movements the patient thought about, and sent his commands to the exoskeleton.  Over 24 months, the patient carried out various mental tasks to train the algorithm to understand his thoughts and to progressively increase the number of movements he could make.  Commenting on the results, Tom Shakespeare, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said it was ""a welcome and exciting advance"" but added: ""Proof of concept is a long way from usable clinical possibility.""  ""A danger of hype always exists in this field. Even if ever workable, cost constraints mean that high-tech options are never going to be available to most people in the world with spinal cord injury.""",technology
492,Canada's first sabre-toothed cat fossil found in Medicine Hat,"During the last ice age, huge cats bigger than an African lion prowled Alberta — including the fearsome beast commonly known as the ""sabre-toothed tiger,"" a new study shows.  The proper name for the extinct predator with foot-long, serrated knife-like canines is Smilodon fatalis.   And up until the discovery of the fossil from Medicine Hat, Alta., the species had never been found further north than Idaho.  That's why a couple of small fossils caught Ashley Reynolds's eye as she was rummaging through the drawers at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto.  ""What struck me is they were listed as being Smilodon from Alberta,"" recalled Reynolds, a PhD student in paleontology at the University of Toronto. ""And I knew that Smilodon wasn't really considered to be a Canadian species.""    The drawer was part of a trove of 1,200 specimens collected in the 1960s by University of Toronto paleontologist C.S. Churcher and his team from the bluffs along the South Saskatchewan River near Medicine Hat that had been roughly sorted but never examined in detail.   Reynolds, who was researching the growth patterns and life histories of extinct cats by looking at their bones, decided to look more carefully at what cat fossils Churcher had found so they could be used in further research.  One of the fossils labelled ""Smilodon"" was too small a piece to be identified.  But another, a bone from the ancient cat's right front paw, was identical other Smilodon bones from the same part of the body, and was positively identified as Canada's first Smilodon.  Reynolds and colleagues published their findings Friday in the Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences. The study was funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.    Smilodons or sabre-toothed cats are an extinct group of big cats with huge canines flattened and serrated like knife blades.  ""They're literally like holding steak knives in your mouth,"" said Reynolds.  Their flattened shape made them fragile and prone to breaking, she added. That's probably why sabre-toothed cats had a shorter and stockier build than lions and tigers — to better pin their prey down and prevent struggles that might break their teeth.  While Smilodon is often referred to colloquially as a ""sabre-toothed tiger"" — and popularized as such in The Flintstones and Ice Age — Reynolds said that's a misnomer, as sabre-toothed cats are just as closely related to housecats as tigers.  The bone found in Alberta is estimated to be 35,000 to 40,000 years old, from the Pleistocene epoch, before there were humans in the area.    At that time, what is now Medicine Hat was part of a plain teeming with herds of horses, camels and bison that cut north and south between the huge Laurentide glacier to the east and the Cordilleran ice sheet to the west.  Reynolds said Smilodon would have stalked those animals by hiding in the grass, as most big cats do today — but its killing method would have been quite different.   While lions, tigers and leopards typically kill their prey with a neat bite to the throat that crushes or blocks their windpipe, Smilodons are thought to have sliced and gored their prey to death by biting into its throat or belly.  ""And essentially what this causes is extreme hemorrhaging — a very rapid loss of blood and then eventual death,"" Reynolds said.    But local herds had more than just Smilodon to fear. Among the bones found with it were also the fossil of an American lion and one that appears to be a cave lion, although that one was too fragmentary for researchers to positively identify.  If it turns out to be a cave lion, it would be the furthest south that species has ever been found. Both those lion species are bigger than African lions — in fact, the American lion was the largest cat in North America at the time.  American lions had previously been found as far north as Edmonton, and scimitar-toothed cats, which are similar in size to African lions, have also previously been found in the area.  Reynolds also identified a lynx or bobcat among the fossils, similar to the smaller cats that still roam the area today.   In fact, very few large predators remain in North America, she noted.  During the last ice age, despite the climatic contrast, the fossil evidence shows Alberta would have had a richer, more diverse ecosystem with herds of hoofed animals and many large predators, similar to the African Savannah, Reynolds said: ""It tells us that the ecosystems and food webs are more complicated than we thought them to be.""    Larisa DeSantis — a Vanderbilt University paleontologist who has studied ice age carnivores, including sabre-toothed cats, but was not involved in the study — called the discovery of Smilodon in Canada ""exciting,"" as it's a major northward expansion of the range of the species.  While it wouldn't be unexpected that sabre-toothed cats could live in that part of Canada, it's hard finding specimens there that can be ""definitively identified,"" she added, especially since carnivores are generally rarer than herbivores.",technology
493,YouTube now recommends fewer conspiracies — and less Canadian political content,"YouTube's recommendation algorithm seems to be trying to actively steer users away from political content and toward more viral or popular videos, an in-depth CBC analysis of over 20,000 recommendations shows.  Go looking for videos about Canadian politics on YouTube and you'll find an endless supply of content. Searches for ""Andrew Scheer"" or ""New Democratic Party"" yield thousands of videos.  But when it comes to YouTube's suggestions — curated videos automatically picked by artificial intelligence and tailored to suit a user's preferences — it's a different story.  While the recommendation algorithm — which has been accused of pushing content based on conspiracies and hate speech in Canada and elsewhere — seems to have cleaned up its act, Canadian political content is scarce in YouTube's recommendations.     Trudeau 'blackface' discussion surged online and then waned after 3 days, report finds    CBC used custom software to track which videos are being recommended to users after they've watched a video located by searching for some 40 keywords, 21 of which are related to the Canadian federal election (see methodology below). Such recommendations appear to the right of the video being watched, under the ""Up next"" label, and are often played automatically once a video is finished.  Only 2.1 per cent of video recommendations on videos located through searches related to Canadian politics were in any way related to the topic. Almost half, or 46.1 per cent, had nothing to do with politics at all.  For example, the most recommended video linked to 21 search terms related to Canadian politics — such as ""Canada election"" — was a TED Talk by journalist Jon Ronson about psychopaths. It was recommended 300 times.  Even in the wake of Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau's blackface scandal, only a tiny minority of the videos YouTube's algorithm recommended following a search for Canadian political material are actually related to Canadian politics or the scandal itself. In a test conducted in the days after, only 6 of the 936 recommended videos in CBC's analysis mentioned the blackface controversy — despite thousands of videos about this topic having been uploaded to YouTube worldwide.    But when you search for videos unrelated to politics — like recipes, pop music or video games — most of the videos recommended by YouTube are directly related to those topics.  A history of troubling content  YouTube has been accused in the past of promoting videos pushing conspiracy theories or extremist views. A former Google engineer told Radio-Canada these videos kept viewers engaged with the website longer and encouraged them to watch more videos, earning YouTube more money through ads.  The social media company announced in January that it would change its recommendation system to reduce harmful content and prioritize what it calls authoritative sources. Since then, tests by CBC show that the recommendation algorithm has changed, and extremist content is less likely to be recommended.  Karen Yeung, a professor of law and computer science at the University of Birmingham in Birmingham, U.K., said it appears YouTube tweaked its recommendation process to avoid being accused of fostering a fragmented political debate in the Canadian election.  But she cautioned it's impossible to be certain that YouTube is diverting viewers away from political content. YouTube does not publicly discuss the details of its algorithms.  And because so many people get their news from YouTube, the lack of relevant recommendations is a form of censorship, Yeung added.  ""In doing that, they're actually also impoverishing the debate by not allowing you to access crucial information,"" she said.  Yeung said YouTube should be more transparent about which videos it's recommending to users by, for example, adding a label to recommended videos that tells viewers why it was brought to their attention.    Anatoliy Gruzd, director of research at Ryerson University's Social Media Lab and an associate professor at the Ted Rogers School of Management, said the results of CBC's test were surprising.  ""Many Canadians turn to YouTube for their news and updates,"" he said, adding that ""if somebody started a search with Canadian politics, you would expect that they would be persistent in their recommendations as well.""  Gruzd said that YouTube's algorithm is always being tweaked, making it hard to determine why the company is making certain choices — but the company's primary goal is to keep viewers on the platform for as long as possible to expose them to online advertising.  He suggested YouTube might have a shortage of Canadian political content, while its fund of American political content is vast. He said the fact that people are more likely to interact with American content — especially anything related to U.S. President Donald Trump — could explain why non-Canadian political videos seem to be recommended more.   Non-political videos get pertinent recommendations  Guillaume Chaslot is a former Google engineer who worked on YouTube's recommendation algorithm. He said he left Google in 2013 because he was troubled by what he saw as YouTube's unwillingness to prevent its algorithm from exposing users to harmful content. Since then, he's been tracking the platform's video recommendations and calls for more transparency in how social media platforms' algorithms function.  Chaslot said he's seen the effect detected by CBC's analysis while examining videos about the protests in Hong Kong. There, he said, people watching videos about the protests are being steered toward videos that have nothing to do with the current political situation.  ""The algorithm's behaviour is really weird on many subjects. It's hard to know for sure what's going on, given that we have so little data on what's going on,"" Chaslot said. ""Globally, we'd need YouTube's own statistics to know for sure. That is data we don't have.""  To see if this effect on political videos also extends to YouTube searches on other topics, CBC analyzed recommendations related to categories unrelated to Canadian politics: foreign leaders and international news, conspiracies and relatively uncontroversial topics such as recipes, video games and sports.    The results show that more pertinent videos were recommended for these control group search terms than for political search terms.    These results seem out of step with the results of other, similar experiments done in the past year.  For example, a Radio-Canada investigation of YouTube recommendations linked to the 2017 Quebec mosque shooting showed that conspiracy videos — both those related to the shooting and videos about other conspiracy theories — fared well in recommendations.  A CBC dive into recommendations about the Ontario provincial election last year found that a Canadian conspiracy channel pushing videos about the election had outperformed all other information sources.    A YouTube spokesperson, who would not speak on the record, said that the number of views that ""harmful"" videos have received through algorithm recommendations has dropped by more than 50 per cent since YouTube announced in January a plan to reduce such content in recommendations. The spokesperson did not say if the change in recommendations observed across the tests from last year and this year was a result of that strategy.  The spokesperson also said that YouTube ""strongly disagrees"" with the methodology CBC used to harvest this data, which was based on a program written by Chaslot, adding that Chaslot has ""limited insight into our recommendation system"" given that he left Google before the system was changed.  Chaslot said it's impossible to know for certain if YouTube is pushing irrelevant content in recommendations in order to flush out harmful videos, since so little is known about how its algorithm works.  He adds that YouTube's recommendation algorithm is one of the company's most closely guarded secrets, since it drives some 70 per cent of the views on the site.  Chaslot said he thinks it's in YouTube's interest to show users recommendations that have nothing to do with what they're searching for. ""The more time you spend time on YouTube, the more they can show you ads,"" he said. ""So, if you're looking for videos about a subject that won't keep you on the site, YouTube will want to push you towards topics that will make you spend more time on the site"".  He added that YouTube is very different from Google, which is optimized to find users the best results as quickly as possible. ""Google's algorithm works with you to help you find what you're looking for. YouTube's algorithm works against you. You have to fight against the algorithm.""  Methodology  To see which videos YouTube recommends, CBC came up with two lists of search terms, one about Canadian political topics, and another with general topics:  Canadian search terms:  Justin Trudeau, Andrew Scheer, Maxime Bernier, Elizabeth May, Jagmeet Singh, Yves-François Blanchet, Liberal Party of Canada, Conservative Party of Canada, People's Party of Canada, Green Party of Canada, New Democratic Party, Bloc Québécois, Canada election, Canada pipelines, Canada carbon tax, Canada immigration, Canada economy, Canada LGBT, Canada refugees, Canada climate change, Canada election ads, Canada federal election.  General search terms:  Toronto Raptors, Donald Trump, Jair Bolsonaro, Emmanuel Macron, Boris Johnson, Brexit, mass shooting, QAnon, vaccines, crisis actor, pasta recipe, Fortnite, Minecraft, yoga class, Taylor Swift, astrophysics, bike repair, Marvel  CBC used a modified Python script written by former YouTube employee Guillaume Chaslot to fetch data on the videos recommended for those search terms. The searches were done on Sept. 9 and 10, 2019. Another search was done on Sept. 23 after the eruption of the blackface scandal involving Justin Trudeau.  The script automates a search on YouTube for a given term and looks at the first five videos that return. It then looks at the first three recommended videos for each of those videos, and the first three recommended videos for those recommended videos, and so on, going five layers deep.  CBC reporters went through the videos and categorized them as either directly pertinent, somewhat pertinent, or irrelevant. For example, on a search for ""Toronto Raptors,"" videos about basketball are directly pertinent, videos about other sports are somewhat pertinent and videos about U.S. politics are irrelevant. This was only done for videos that were recommended three or more times for each search term.  The resulting data can be accessed here.",technology
494,Here's what we know about the ransomware that hit 3 Ontario hospitals,"Hackers have crippled the computer systems of three Ontario hospitals in recent weeks, prompting concern about the type of malicious software used and whether more facilities may be at risk.  The malware, known as ""Ryuk,"" attacks computer networks but remains invisible to average users for weeks or months. During that time, it collects information about the organization and its perceived ability to pay a ransom.  Ryuk then locks files, demanding the network owner pay a sum of money to make them accessible again.  The criminals behind the attack ""will learn how you operate from A to Z… then they'll hit you,"" Zohar Pinhasi, a Florida-based cyber counterterrorism expert told CBC News. He said it's likely other Canadian hospitals are affected and haven't yet detected it.  ""If you get hit by them, it would be devastating.""  Delays for patients, headaches for staff  The impact of the malware attack has been wide-ranging for the three affected hospitals, located in Toronto and southwestern Ontario. Email systems were taken offline, health-care records became harder to access and patients were warned of longer wait times.  Employees had to transcribe patient information onto paper by hand. Hospital officials stressed, though, no data had been accessible to the hackers.    The malware ""came into our system, but no data left our hospital,"" said Sarah Downey, CEO of Toronto's Michael Garron Hospital. ""It was picked up by a firewall before [the data] could leave.""  Michael Garron Hospital, formerly known as the Toronto East General, posted a message on its website on Sep. 26, alerting the public that it had ""discovered a virus on one of the IT systems.""   The same day, the Listowel Wingham Hospitals Alliance said on Facebook its two hospitals in rural southwestern Ontario were suffering an ""information technology system disruption, which means our clinical applications are affected.""    All three hospitals said they paid no money to retrieve their files and no specific amount was demanded. Systems at all three facilities are in the process of being restored, the hospitals said.  The RCMP urges malware victims not to pay any ransom because there's no guarantee the files will be unlocked. Cyber criminals may even demand more money or identify the victim as a target for further attacks.  First identified in Aug. 2018, cybersecurity experts estimate Ryuk netted hackers the Bitcoin equivalent of $3.7 million US within five months.  Pinhasi, the U.S.-based expert, said the hackers ""are sitting on a goldmine.""    In an advisory last June, the U.K.'s National Cyber Security Centre warned the malicious code associated with Ryuk will block anti-malware software, allow hackers to monitor a victim's computer activity and spread to other machines on the same network.  Access to the computers can even be sold to ""other criminal operators,"" the British report said.  It's unclear how the Ontario hospitals became targets, but the malware often penetrates systems using a Trojan horse: a user opens an infected email attachment and the malicious code spreads. (Police advise users not to click on emails from people they don't know.)  Hospitals often targeted  The Ontario health-care facilities aren't the only ones that have fallen victim to Ryuk attacks in recent days.  This week, three Alabama hospitals said a similar infection shut down computer systems and blocked access to patient lists. Several hospitals in Australia were paralyzed by a ransomware attack, also reported to involve Ryuk.  The episode, however, barely compares to the massive proportions of the global WannaCry ransomware pandemic in 2017, then described by European police as reaching an ""unprecedented level"" of infection.    At the time, many of the victims were found to have been running out-of-date Windows software that wasn't protected from such infections.  Adam Mansour, a cybersecurity expert with IntelliGO Networks in Toronto, said health-care facilities are particularly vulnerable to malware attacks because of their reliance on specialized software that only rarely gets updated.  ""Hospitals, unfortunately have software that is hard to upgrade,"" he said.  Hard to beat  It's unclear who's responsible for the recent string of Ryuk attacks. Cybercrime analysts and specialized bloggers have suggested several criminal groups have been mounting such attacks and that the malware itself may originate from Russia.  The name ""Ryuk"" itself is taken from a Japanese comic book character who ""cannot be harmed by conventional human weapons,"" according to a description on the industry website Comic Vine.    It seems the malware can't easily be beaten, either. Mansour said system administrators usually have to ""reimage"" computers to reset them to their previous configurations from before the ransomware attack to restore full functionality.   He warns, though, it doesn't always work. ""We've seen a lot of cases where just reimaging... is really just delaying the inevitable, which is that (the malware) will come right back.""",technology
495,How we got inside an overseas tech support scam targeting Canadians,"Inside the office where a call centre had been scamming Canadians, the workers didn't see the CBC Marketplace crew coming. Sitting in a low-rise building along a busy Mumbai street, they froze when confronted by journalists demanding to know why they had been intimidating vulnerable Canadians on the other side of their world.   Everything stopped. Calls ended abruptly. None of the workers spoke. Their faces were clearly stunned at what may have been the first-ever intrusion into an operation that has existed openly, but largely without interference from law enforcement.  Marketplace's efforts to locate those behind the tech support scam spanned months, including cultivating a relationship with someone inside the operation; it ended in a late-night dash up three flights of stairs into the call centre.  Tech support scams — which involve fraudsters posing as support staff, oftentimes from legitimate well-known companies, like Microsoft, Google or Apple — are nothing new. But they continue to plague North Americans, bilking people of millions each year.  ""Around the globe, we found that two out of three people had experience with the tech support scam,"" said Microsoft's chief digital safety officer, Courtney Gregoire, whose company is frequently named in the scammers' online pop-ups or phone calls.    ""I used to take out $3,000 from Canadian and [American] pockets every day,"" said Puneet Malik. Until recently, he worked inside one of the many overseas call centres, demanding payment from unsuspecting Westerners.  ""My pitch used to start with $200, so that basically means at least they will be giving $200 if they want their computer back ... It's a scare tactic.""  How it works  Instilling fear in would-be victims is a common ingredient for overseas call centres. Those on the receiving end might be threatened with arrest or prosecution for having illicit or illegal material on their computers, purportedly installed by phantom foreign sources. At the very least, loss of computer functionality is suggested.   None of it is true.  Watch: Marketplace allows the scammers to take over a computer:    The tech support scam may be one of India's largest, but it is accompanied by similar scams — the tax scam, the payday loan scam or the immigration scam, among others — run out of similar centres, often using the same employees.  The tech support scam plays out in three main ways:       Pop-ups: A pop-up window appears on your screen, warning your computer is at risk or infected by a virus. The window — which can be intrusive and difficult to close — directs users to call a toll-free number for assistance.     Phoney search engine results: Scammers try to get their websites and phone numbers to appear on Google or other search engines when users are seeking ways to repair a malfunctioning smartphone or computer. They may also buy ads to promote their ""support.""     Cold calls: Scammers call potential victims directly, convincing them that their computer or phone has been identified as one that is infected — and the only fix is to pay for clean-up.     When Nahid Philipos's phone stopped working, an online search for ""iPhone support"" ended with her unknowingly on the line with a scammer. He was convincing, she said, keeping her on the line as she followed his instructions and bought $3,000 worth of iTunes gift cards.    ""He said there are many problems on the phone. There are hackers from Russia, from China, from India and Brazil,"" Philipos recalled. ""He said it's a complicated issue; it has to be minimum $3,000 to be able to do the transaction.""  The scammer promised the money would be returned once the phone was fixed. It never was.  Money isn't necessarily the main goal  Figures from the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre indicate just over $850,000 was extracted from Canadians by this one scam in 2018, down from more than $1.3 million the year before. But authorities acknowledge the true figure is likely much higher, as few report being victimized.   Most at risk are the elderly and new Canadians, who may not be familiar with how tech support operates in North America, or who may legitimately fear the repercussions threatened by the scammers, including arrest.  But money is not the scammers' only goal. They'll also try to seize control of a victim's computer, often by installing remote access software that can leave a permanent backdoor, allowing the scammers access to sensitive personal information, like banking transactions, tax filings, passwords and emails.     ""We've had situations where ID has been taken out on people, and fake drivers' licences,"" said Ryan Duquette, a former fraud detective turned cybersecurity consultant.   ""We've had situations where a For Sale sign has been posted on somebody's front yard without their knowledge of that even happening. So they've been able to steal their identity [and] take a mortgage out in their name. So it can be pretty scary when it gets stolen.""  And once an individual has fallen for one scam, they are likely to be targeted by others. The fraudsters sell so-called lead lists for pennies, indicating who was taken, how much was stolen and which scam was used.   CBC's secret effort to find the scammers  While there was a flurry of raids and arrests at the end of 2018 against a number of Indian-based call centres, there has been no reported law enforcement action against the centres targeting Canadians in 2019.  So Marketplace worked with confidential sources to get inside a large Mumbai-based call centre to see if the 2018 arrests had done anything to curb these illicit activities.  It began by convincing a current employee to wear a hidden camera into the scam centre, where dozens of young men and women spend hours on the phones. The camera recorded various individuals making and receiving calls, co-ordinating access into home computers on the other side of the world and threatening those on the other end of the line.    Even when confronted by would-be victims on the phone, the scammers pushed back, seemingly unperturbed of any consequences.  ""Do whatever you want to do,"" a scammer said in one recording. ""You can report me to the Donald Trump as well, because we are not afraid of that, OK?""  One source told Marketplace he'd previously seen Indian police inside the call centre, being friendly with managers but taking no action to stop the fraudulent activities.    And yet after detailed surveillance on the building, a CBC crew was able to bolt up the stairs, past two doors that normally were locked and stand face-to-face with those on the phones.  They froze. A security guard at the front was speechless.  After asking why the group continued to scam vulnerable Canadians — but getting no response — the CBC crew left the building. This scam is big business and enforcers have been known to use weapons and violence to maintain their enterprise.  RCMP vows more action  In response to a growing number of complaints about overseas scams, the RCMP launched Project Octavia late last year, which seeks to work with Indian authorities to shut down these illegal call centres.  ""We're making headway,"" said RCMP Supt. Peter Payne, with the national financial crimes division. ""These investigations are quite complex and most of the perpetrators live in India. We have jurisdictional issues, so it's not as simple as us going over there and making the arrests, impacting the investigations.""    The RCMP says more action is coming — both in India and Canada, where potential accomplices may act as mules to move money back to the top scam bosses.  But public awareness is key, the RCMP says.  If you end up on a call like this, where someone is demanding payment over the phone to fix your computer, the advice is to hang up immediately. And never allow an unknown caller to gain remote access to or to install anything on your phone or computer.  ",technology
496,"Comet from another star system is on its way in, and astronomers say to expect more","For the second time in just under two years, astronomers have confirmed that we are being buzzed by an interstellar visitor, and some experts estimate that we'll be seeing more of them.   In early September, amateur astronomer Gennady Borisov discovered a comet using a homemade 0.65-metre telescope. Early observations by professional astronomers suggested the orbit of the object took it outside our solar system, though further observations were needed to confirm.  Last week, the International Astronomical Union's (IAU) Minor Planet Center (MPC) was able to calculate a preliminary orbit, which verified that the comet had a hyperbolic orbit — meaning that it is orbiting in a way that prevents it from being captured by the sun's gravity.   The comet was officially named 2Iu002FBorisov by the MPC on Sept. 24. Comets are usually named after their discoverer. The 2I in the name designates it as the second interstellar object detected.  It will make its closest approach to the sun — called perihelion —on Dec. 7. It will be roughly 300 million kilometres from both the sun and Earth. It's even anticipated that amateur astronomers will be able to see it through large telescopes.  Astronomers are excited by the new find as it comes hot on the heels of the first discovery of an interstellar object: 1Iu002F'Oumuamua, discovered in October 2017. But they believe these are the first of many.  ""I think what this is telling us is that probably these are more common than we thought,"" said Peter Brown, professor of physics and astronomy at Western University in London, Ont.    It's not that our solar system has suddenly become a shooting gallery for interstellar objects: it's just likely that we're getting better at finding them.  Brown believes that one of the reasons for this is the increase in sky surveys, which use telescopes that constantly scan the sky specifically searching for asteroids and comets. Pan-STARRS is one such survey, and detected 1Iu002F'Oumuamua, which was then confirmed by Canadian Robert Weryk, who is working out of the University of Hawaii's Institute for Astronomy.  And there are more sky surveys to come.  ""I think when the [Large Synoptic Survey Telescope] comes online in a few years, this will be once a year we'll be finding something,"" Brown said.  That device, or LSST, is an 8.4-metre telescope in Chile scheduled to be fully operational in 2023. Among its objectives is to find hazardous asteroids.  But the thing is, Comet 2Iu002FBorisov wasn't found by a sky survey at all, but rather by an amateur astronomer using a fairly large telescope.  Amateur contributions  ""Amateurs do great work,"" said Norm Murray, a professor at the University of Toronto's department of astronomy and astrophysics and at the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics. ""And a lot of them are pretty technically sophisticated. And it's true that up until fairly recently most comets were found by amateurs. So that part is not surprising.""  But what is surprising is that they're discovering something of this magnitude, something that Brown also appreciates.  ""I think it just shows there's still a niche for amateurs; it's just fantastic,"" Brown said. ""I think we're going to start seeing a lot of things we haven't seen before.""  Differences in the interstellar objects  The interesting thing about the two interstellar objects is just how different they are.   'Oumuamua, as the body is known in astronomers' shorthand, shows characteristics of both an asteroid and a comet. For one, orbital data suggested that it was outgassing, a process where ice turns from a solid to a gas, skipping the water stage. This is what produces the tails we most associate with comets.     However, the issue was, it was invisible. The only reason astronomers could tell that it was outgassing was that something was nudging it slightly along its trajectory, which they concluded was due to escaping gases. But optically, it still remained as a point in the sky, missing the characteristic comet tail.  And 'Oumuamua was small, roughly 100 metres, and shaped more like a cigar.   On the other hand, Borisov has already shown signs of a cometary tail, and it's estimated to be a few kilometres in diameter with a more traditional round shape.  These findings suggest that the two were formed differently.      ""One came from a system like our sun with comets around it, and the other one came from somewhere else,"" Murray said.   What's most exciting for astronomers is that, while 'Oumuamua was discovered as it was on its way out of the solar system, Borisov was discovered on its way in, which means, instead of just a few weeks of observations, they will be able to study it far more in depth than they were able to with 'Oumuamua.  Unfortunately, it's likely that we won't know from which star system Borisov originated. Its size suggests that it's quite old, which makes it more difficult to trace back in time, over perhaps tens of millions of years.  Murray said that what is exciting is that astronomers have been looking for these objects for some time, but had theorized that, using sky surveys like the upcoming LSST, we could only expect to find one every hundred years. Instead, here we have two: one discovered by a sky survey, the other by an amateur astronomer.  So what does that tell us about our expectations?  ""Expectations are dominated by things we already know,"" said Murray. ""We have no imagination. That's what it tells you.""",technology
497,Japanese spacecraft releases rover to explore asteroid,"Japan's Hayabusa2 spacecraft released a small rover on Thursday that will land on the surface of an asteroid as part its final mission before heading back to Earth, Japan's space agency said.  The Minerva-II2 rover began a slow descent to the asteroid Ryugu, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, or JAXA, said.  Hayabusa2 arrived in the area in June 2018. It has collected soil samples and other data from the asteroid 300 million kilometres from Earth in a series of missions aimed at obtaining clues to the origin of the solar system.  The spacecraft released the rover, which resembles a circular cookie tin, from about one kilometre above the asteroid's surface. It will collect data and images of the rover as it descends over the next few days to Ryugu — named after a dragon castle in a Japanese folk tale — to research the asteroid's gravity.    It's the last mission for the hugely popular spacecraft, whose name means falcon.  Hayabusa2 is to start its yearlong return trip to Earth later this year.  Two similar solar-powered rovers were deployed to Ryugu last year to collect surface data and take photos.    Hayabusa2 itself landed on the asteroid twice, despite difficulties caused by Ryugu's rockier-than-expected surface, which provided limited landing possibilities. In the first touchdown in February, it collected surface dust samples. In July, it collected underground samples for the first time in space history after landing in a crater it earlier created by blasting the surface.  JAXA scientists believe the underground samples contain valuable data unaffected by space radiation and other environmental factors that could tell more about the origin of the solar system billions of years ago.  Asteroids, which orbit the sun but are much smaller than planets, are among the oldest objects in the solar system and may help explain how Earth evolved.",technology
498,Tropical turtle found 'cold-stunned' in B.C. waters,"A sea turtle from the tropics has been found a long way from home and in frigid waters near Port Alberni, B.C.   The olive ridley sea turtle, nicknamed Berni Stranders, had a body temperature of just 11 C, nine degrees colder than its ideal body temperature, according to the Vancouver Aquarium.  The adult, male turtle was hypothermic or cold-stunned, said head veterinarian Dr. Martin Haulena.  When that happens, a turtle's heart and respiration rate will slow and it becomes unable to swim or look for food, a statement from the aquarium said.     The turtle is currently being treated at the aquarium's Marine Mammal Rescue Centre.  ""Once he's stronger and showing signs of responsiveness, staff will place him in a pool set at the same temperature as his body for short periods of time,"" said rescue centre manager Lindsaye Akhurst in a news release.  ""Berni has a long road to recovery but he is responding to treatment,"" she said.   In an interview Thursday on CBC's On The Coast, Akhurst said staff are slowly increasing the temperature in the room at the aquarium where Stranders is rehabilitating, and that he perks up during his scheduled swims.  ""It's a fairly slow process,"" said Akhurst (no pun intended).  Stranders measures just about one meter long and just over half a meter wide.  'He's very handsome,"" said Akhurst.    It's still not clear why the turtle showed up so far north. The aquarium said it's only the fourth of its species to be recorded in B.C. waters in about 20 years.  Olive ridley turtles can typically be found in the Gulf of California, as well as reefs in the Caribbean Sea off the coast of Central and South America.  Stranders was spotted by members of the public who called Fisheries and Oceans Canada. Fisheries staff transported the turtle to Parksville, B.C. where aquarium staff collected him and moved him to Vancouver.    Haulena said it could be due to a warm area of water in the Pacific Ocean called the blob or higher than average sea temperatures in general.    Olive ridley sea turtles are fairly abundant worldwide but are considered vulnerable because they nest in only a few places, according to the World Wildlife Foundation. ",technology
499,The problem with Ontario's plan to ban food waste from landfills,"Ontario has ambitious plans to ban all organic waste from landfills by 2022, but the province has not said how it will handle all of the additional compost.  ""We're going to run out of room,"" said Mike Chopowick, Ontario's waste management director. ""The No. 1 issue is going to be capacity. Ontario produces a lot of waste.""  The province launched its food and organic waste framework in 2017.  Food thrown in the trash rather than the green bin has a significant environmental impact. When it reaches the landfill and starts decomposing, it releases methane — a gas that is estimated to be about 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide over a 100-year span.  It also contaminates the ground and water with leachate, the liquid that leaks from landfill trash, and wastes any potential for reuse.  Ontario will be the third province to ban organic waste in landfills, following Nova Scotia and P.E.I.     In 2015, Ontario's restaurants, residents, retail outlets and farmers generated about 3.7 million tonnes of food and organic waste. Much of it was food that could have been eaten or reused, the authors of the framework found. About 60 per cent of that waste was sent to landfill instead of organic waste facilities.  Dianne Saxe, president of the green consultancy Saxe Facts and Ontario's former environmental commissioner, says the province's political leaders must boost the capacity of Ontario's composting facilities ahead of the ban.  ""Part of the effort to get organic waste out of the landfill has to fall on the government,"" she said. ""They have to make it possible to make facilities. If we had a ban [on food in the landfill] tomorrow, where would it all go?""  Lessons from other provinces  Nearly two decades after Nova Scotia implemented its ban in 1998, about half of the province's landfill trash was still organic waste.  What's more, Nova Scotia's composting facilities contained towering piles of compost — so much that it could not be composted fast enough. The materials have to be run once or twice through the composting steps as a result. And even then, no one wanted to buy the soil that resulted from it.    The piles were becoming too contaminated with plastics, glass and other non-organic items. Facilities were finding just about everything in the organic waste — including tires, underwear, clothes, forks, and plates.    Farmers were unwilling to take the end product off the city's hands, even for free, because they weren't sold on the quality.   Vancouver, which banned food waste in 2015, was able to cut the amount of organic waste going into the landfill in the first year by only 22 per cent. The city eased in its ban, with inspectors targeting only loads with more than 25 per cent visible food waste and issuing surcharges.  Canadians waste a lot of food  Ontario similarly plans to phase in its ban.  Rather than boosting composting capacity, the province's goal is to attempt to reduce and reuse waste by working with government, producers, and consumers to raise awareness about how we consume.  That's going to take some doing. Communities across Canada waste a lot.  More than half of the food produced is thrown away, according to a study by Second Harvest, a Toronto-based group working to reduce food waste. According to that study, 32 per cent of food wasted is perfectly edible.     ""Apples rot under trees due to labour shortages or low prices, making it uneconomical for farmers to harvest,"" the Second Harvest report said.  ""Surplus milk flows into sewers. Thousands of acres of produce are plowed under due to cancelled orders. Fish are caught, then tossed back into the water to die if they don't match the quota.""    Solutions beyond composting  It's even worse when retail outlets and consumers throw food in the garbage, said Paul van der Werf, an environmental consultant and food waste researcher at Western University in London.  ""Because we live in a country with so much available to us, people don't link what they buy to what they're going to use,"" he said.  ""They don't think about the food they're going to waste because they can always say, 'Oh well, I'll just buy some more.' It's all about tweaking behaviours like these.""    Much of this waste is entirely avoidable, says Saxe, and Canada should be looking at solutions beyond composting.  ""There is a hierarchy of things that can be done with food waste, landfill being the worst, of course,"" she said. ""The first being feed other people [and] the second being to feed animals. And if neither of those is possible, turn it into compost.""  In Canada, there is a law that protects against liability if your donated food makes someone sick, and many organizations accept food that could be past the best before date, which generally signal a decrease in quality, not an expiration.   Saxe says it comes down to innovative thinking.    At buffets in Germany, extra food is sold in large buckets for cheap at the end of the night. Companies across Canada and the United States will take unsold and uneaten food and feed it to the hungry. Grocery stores in France are banned from throwing out ugly or unsold food.  ""Initiatives like these help mitigate food waste and doesn't cost anything to do,"" Saxe said. ""This is the kind of thinking we need to get rid of food waste.""  ",technology
500,"Yes, computers really are taking jobs from humans — especially in banking: Don Pittis","A worrying new report has just added a credible voice to the idea that computers are coming for our jobs.  As I write, the clients-only Wells Fargo report has not been made public, but those who have seen it quote the 225-page document as saying technology will slash 10 per cent of banking jobs over the next decade.  While the number of North American manufacturing jobs shrinks, service sector jobs, including in banking, have been a mainstay of job creation. That may be about to change.  ""Technological efficiencies will result in the biggest reduction in head count across the U.S. banking industry in its history,"" said an article released by the global business news service Bloomberg.  In a story titled Tech forecast to destroy more than 200,000 US bank jobs the Financial Times quotes the report's author as saying the job cuts will be the ""greatest transfer from labour to capital"" of all time, and will represent a ""golden age of banking efficiency.""  With such remarks, the report by well-known banking analyst Mike Mayo seems aimed at people like bank shareholders who yesterday lost money in the markets.    But for bank employees and those worried about where jobs will come from, the report from Wells Fargo, the U.S. banking giant famous for its stagecoach origins and for its 2016 account fraud scandal, the news may not be so good.    The essence of the report is that a huge investment in technology by the financial industry, estimated at $150 billion US annually including in artificial intelligence, is paying off. It means new job cuts would allow the banks to continue to find efficiencies well beyond the ATM banking and branch closures familiar to Canadians that have helped banks repeatedly increase profits.  While the report focuses on the U.S. industry, Canadian banks are known as leaders in many areas of banking automation, including debit cards and remote banking.  As the Wells Fargo report says, large banks able to take advantage of the new technology will be among the greatest beneficiaries. The biggest Canadian banks with operations in the U.S. and around the globe usually rank in the top 10 North American banks by capitalization.  More job cuts  Front-line branch employees have already been thinned out, but the new cuts are expected to be spread across branches and head offices. Call centres will also lose jobs, the report says.  The loss of relatively low-paying jobs in customer service is a reminder that low wages don't prevent businesses from cutting staff, something opponents of minimum wage increases sometime suggest. With half of a business's outlays going to employment costs, reducing workers whatever their wage level remains one of the only practical ways of increasing profits.  The trend also confirms concerns over the growing income divide between jobs that can be replaced by computers and those that, so far, cannot. Among the jobs that the report says will remain relatively safe include the tech workers needed to keep the banking software running and secure.    Other jobs less likely to be cut will be in sales, consulting and advising, the report says.  Earlier fears for job losses were due to automation where robots could do the physical work that formerly required human labour or machine operators. As many reports told us as early as 2013, robots were replacing warehouse workers and assembly line employees.  At the time service jobs were seen as an alternative, requiring young people to learn to use their brains rather than their brawn. This latest report is a reminder that as software becomes more sophisticated, higher-level jobs will also disappear, and not just in banking.    Predictions a decade into the future, whether in banking or any other industry, are inevitably uncertain.  Many economists have insisted that job losses in one sector do not mean there will be fewer jobs overall. So far that has proven true.    But a recession caused by the simmering global trade war may mean it will take time for society to create new jobs lost to technology in administrative jobs like banking.  Banking's life blood   This week new figures from the U.S. show manufacturing slumped sharply for the second month in a row as the U.S.-China trade war begins to bite. That decline in factory activity has been described as one of the triggers for the latest stock market tumble in the U.S. and Canada.  ""The disappointing data is only fanning long-standing fears of slowing global growth,"" said Alec Young, managing director of Global Markets Research at FTSE Russell, this week.  A slowing economy is not good for banks. As Canadians look for ways to cut back they will be less likely to pile on debt, expanding the loan book of banks, their life blood.   When it was expected interest rates were on the way up banks would at least have benefited as borrowers were forced to pay a little more to extend their loans. But now rates seem to be on the way back down.  If a recession comes, banks will be competing to get their costs down too, making the replacement of human workers with much cheaper technology an alluring prospect.

501,A closer look at the arsenal China paraded to stir pride at home — and unnerve rivals abroad,"When it comes to China's high-tech military arsenal, just hearing the names can be intimidating: hypersonic missiles, stealth drones and ""carrier killers.""  To the uninitiated, they may sound like weapons ripped from the pages of science fiction.  But they're here today, and experts say they're part of China's strategy to stir nationalist pride at home — and have the added effect of unnerving potential rivals abroad.  President Xi Jinping hosted an unprecedented military parade on Tuesday, marking 70 years of Communist rule and meant to flex Beijing's military muscle.     Some 15,000 troops marched through part of Tiananmen Square in an 80-minute show of force, featuring manned and unmanned military aircraft and a wide array of missiles.   A leading U.S. expert on the Chinese military called it the ""largest, most impressive military parade in the history of the world.""  In particular, wrote Prof. Andrew Erickson of the U.S. Naval War College's China Maritime Studies Institute, China's unveiling of new missiles has put the country ""at the cutting-edge of frontier military technologies.""  Forty per cent of the arms on display Tuesday had not been shown in public before, according to Chinese state media.  Among the most prominent new additions was the Dongfeng-17 (DF-17). What sets the missile apart from conventional arms is its use of a hypersonic technology — described by the U.S.-based Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance as incorporating ""the speed of a ballistic missile with the manoeuvring capabilities of a cruise missile.""     Hypersonic aircraft typically collect oxygen during flight, mixing it with hydrogen fuel for extreme propulsion.   The DF-17 could potentially fly at speeds greater than Mach 5, or more than five times the speed of sound (approximately 6,200 kmu002Fh). The combination of speed and manoeuvrability led the Japanese defence ministry to recently warn the DF-17 would be ""more difficult to intercept"" than other weapons.  A senior Pentagon official put it more bluntly: ""We do not have defences against those systems.""    In other words, U.S. military bases in Asia will be at greater risk as Chinese technology outpaces American defence systems.  Michael Griffin, the U.S. undersecretary of defence for research and engineering, told a U.S. Senate committee last year, should China ""choose to employ"" supersonic missiles, ""we would be, today, at a disadvantage.""  The U.S. and Russia are both said to be developing their own hypersonic weapons.  Big price tag  Officially, the U.S. still spends more than any other country on its military — $649 billion US in 2018, compared to China's estimated $250 billion US. But exactly how much Beijing spends on defence isn't entirely clear. The Japanese Defence Ministry has criticized China for a lack of transparency regarding its military spending.  China has taken the added step of blurring the lines between civilian and military innovation. Under a civil-military integration strategy, Beijing seeks to attract technology from the private sector and adapt it to give the People's Liberation Army an edge.   It may be no coincidence a U.S. congressional report noted the Chinese military is progressing steadily in the fields of artificial intelligence and cloud computing.  Those more discreet forms of technology, however, did not play a big role in the People's Republic of China's 70th anniversary. Tuesday's parade saw 580 pieces of military equipment put on display.    Another missile, the DF-21D, is said to have a range of 1,500 kilometres and is nicknamed the ""carrier killer"" for its apparent ability to hit warships at sea. Just as ominously, China's DF-26 has been dubbed the ""Guam killer,"" a reference to the U.S. island territory thousands of kilometres away that was a target for North Korean — rather than Chinese — threats in 2017.  The military flew helicopters and aircraft during its parade but kept a stealth drone grounded. The Gongji-11 (GJ-11) unmanned aerial vehicle looks like a futuristic jet, with a reported wingspan of 62 metres — slightly wider than that of a Boeing 787 Dreamliner.  Despite its size, its stealth capability means the drone is ""expected to 'sneak' into enemy airspaces and attack targets of strategic value undetected,"" according to a report on the Military Factory weaponry reference website.  China ostensibly only displays weaponry already in use. The GJ-11 is so advanced, however, it's unknown whether it's ready to be flown.  Andrew Erickson, the expert on China's military, said Tuesday's ""biggest single statement for foreign consumption"" was China's new intercontinental ballistic missile, the DF-41.  The country's ""newest, most powerful, and arguably most advanced nuclear weapons system,"" he wrote, ""designed and deployed with deterring the United States in mind.""  Who's watching?  Although the display of China's high-tech arsenal may cause consternation abroad, some observers contend it was meant more for a domestic audience. It comes as China deals with an economic slowdown, a trade war with the U.S. and a crisis in Hong Kong.  The celebration and show of strength was intended ""to create a great sense of pride among Chinese people,"" said Lynette Ong, an associate professor and China expert at Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy.  She said the message it conveyed was one of grandeur and a sense of Chinese achievement after 70 years of Communist rule.    Ong said during the celebrations, she checked in with friends on the Chinese social network WeChat.   And indeed, she said, they ""were beaming with pride.""  ",technology
502,Tidal energy companies join forces for Bay of Fundy project,"Two tidal energy companies are joining forces to develop technology to harness the Bay of Fundy's powerful tides.  Sustainable Marine Energy and Minas Tidal LP will use a technology that includes turbines on a floating platform — instead of on the ocean floor — with the hope of eventually delivering nine megawatts of tidal energy to Nova Scotia's electricity grid.  ""When you look at the economics of trying to get these first demonstration projects underway, it makes a lot more sense to work as a team to address these challenges and get something in the water,"" said Jason Hayman, managing director of Sustainable Marine Energy, in a phone interview from Dublin where he is attending the annual Ocean Energy Europe conference.  ""It tends to be quite expensive to raise the money because, of course, investors expect higher returns for the higher risk.""  Sustainable Marine Energy was given a tidal licence for the Bay of Fundy in July. It allows them to sell electricity to Nova Scotia Power at 53 cents per kilowatt hour, according to a news release from the province.  Project expected to launch next year  Sustainable Marine Energy and Minas Tidal LP have formed a joint-venture company, Spicer Marine Energy Inc., which will run the Pempa'q In-stream Tidal Energy Project, set to begin next year.  This comes more than a year after another joint venture at the Fundy Ocean Research Centre for Energy (FORCE) ran into financial trouble.  Cape Sharp Tidal Venture, made up of Emera and Irish company OpenHydro, deployed a turbine in the Bay of Fundy shortly before OpenHydro entered creditor protection last summer.  The turbine is still sitting in the Minas Passage and there is no timeline for its removal.  ""It is being monitored and it is in a safe state,"" said Energy and Mines Minister Derek Mombourquette in a statement.    ""It's not spinning and there is no impact on the environment or marine life. We are actively pursuing a private-sector solution for retrieval and disposal of the turbine. There has been significant interest from developers.""  Hayman said the experiences of the Cape Sharp Tidal Venture are driving design considerations on the project.    He said the Bay of Fundy poses unique challenges for deploying equipment, but the company has been doing tests of its floating in-stream technology in Scotland and Grand Passage, N.S., and is becoming more efficient. Hayman used the example of changing turbine blades.    ""The first time we went to do it, it took a whole day,"" he said. ""Next time we went to do it, it took half a day. Third time the guys went to do it, it took an hour.""  He said underwater turbines are expensive to deploy and maintain, but the floating system makes it easier to perform maintenance and reduces costs.  Hayman said it's also more environmentally friendly because not having anything going through the water column means marine animals can go around the turbines more easily.  Ambitious plans  Hayman said the companies hope to put in the first platform in the Bay of Fundy next year. Eventually, there will be three put in altogether, which are slightly larger and will produce 50 times more power than the one in Grand Passage.  Hayman wouldn't disclose the cost of the 15-year project, but the first phase is being paid for by reconcept Group, a Hamburg-based company.  MORE TOP STORIES",technology
503,From pipelines to fibre optics: How drilling technology is reshaping the urban landscape,"The Inventions of Oil is a CBC Edmonton series about oil and gas innovations hidden in our everyday lives.    Deep in south Edmonton, a driller carefully manoeuvres his rig while a steerhand follows the route of the drill on a computer screen as it navigates its way underground.   They can't physically see which path the bore is taking. Instead, sonar technology keeps the drill bit clear of any obstructions along the way.  ""If you could X-ray and look at the ground there's more traffic underground than you would think — more gas lines, more power lines, more fibre optic,"" said Blain Bourdages, owner of Ironman Directional Boring.   His company works with gas, water and telecommunication companies, installing lines around the city using horizontal directional drilling: a technique first developed in the oil and gas industry, but has become standard for underground construction in cities.      From oil to beer: How pipeline technology could change the food industry   Refining the Hula Hoop: How the oil industry sparked a global plastics boom   How fertilizer made from Alberta natural gas helps feed the planet    Bourdages entered the business in 2009 when directional drilling was new to the construction industry in Edmonton.  Since then dozens of companies like his have joined him.  ""Instead of digging stuff up we drill past it,"" he said. ""That's why, it was — and it still is — the hot way to get things done.""  Rather than digging a trench, HDD technology uses a drill bit with high-pressure water to drill under a road, sidewalk or parking lot.  Evidence of a trench can be seen near Bourdages's worksite, a seam of blacktop running the width of a street where lines were replaced a few years earlier.  That job would have taken days or weeks, Bourdages said, but directional drilling can do the same work in one day.     ""I liken it a lot to open-heart surgery versus angioplasty,"" said Sam Ariaratnam, an engineering professor at Arizona State University who began researching HDD in the 1990s at the University of Alberta.   ""With open-heart surgery it's like open-cut construction,"" he said, ""it takes some time to recover and there's the scar.""   HDD is similar to angioplasty where an incision is made with as little disruption as possible and the patient is back up and running the next day, Ariaratnam said.   Crossing a river underground  Slant drilling dates back to the early days of the oil industry.  Remember the scene in the movie There Will Be Blood when Daniel Day Lewis yells, ""I drink your milkshake""? He's talking about slant drilling albeit in a much cruder form.  But it wasn't until late in the 20th century that drillers found ways to guide and change the course of a drill underground with the level of accuracy needed for municipal construction.   In 1971, Martin Cherrington, the owner of a utility company in California, was contracted by a gas company to solve a problem. The company needed to install a four-inch gas line underneath a river.      Enbridge mulls drilling under Mackenzie River to replace pipeline section   140 organizations and officials oppose exploratory drilling in area between 2 protected B.C. parks    Cherrington used a drill to bore under the river without digging or trenching. At the time, there was still guess-work involved, as there was no precise way to track the drill underground, but the effort spawned horizontal directional drilling.   By the 1980s, technology allowed companies to track the location of the drill from the surface as it bored underground, using an electromagnetic signal.      With the advent of fibre-optic technology, there came a booming demand for HDD, Ariaratnam said.  ""I moved to Edmonton in 1996 and I got my first cell phone in 1996,"" he said.   ""We started putting these broadband networks all over the world [and] all of these are being done in urban centres.  ""Horizontal directional drilling is a great way to do it.""  Bigger cities, more demand  Bourdages's company is busy in the summer doing work for companies like Epcor and Telus installing and replacing utility lines and fibre optics.  Telus has spent $3 billion in Alberta since 2013 connecting communities to its fibre-optic network and has pledged to spend $16 billion more.      Telus to spend $16B in Alberta on fibre-optic cable network, company says    AltaGas and ATCO Gas plan to eventually replace the steel pipes with plastic.    ""There's so much activity that a lot of the homeowners are coming out saying, 'Why are you digging up my yard!'"" Bourdages said.   ""Once you explain what's going on, they calm right down.   ""Here's your options,"" Bourdages said. ""We can have a bucket hoe dig across your yard or we can make two small holes, shoot across it, and then you can keep your nice Kentucky bluegrass.""      Bourdages said HDD has transformed the industry in the last 10 years.   ""It seems like everywhere you look there's someone new with a drill,"" he said, "" The technology is out there and guys are scooping it up.""",technology
504,Scheer says British Columbia's carbon tax hasn't worked. Expert studies say it has,"A significant piece of the federal election debate in 2019 rests on what the government of British Columbia did on July 1, 2008 — and how you understand what happened after that.  Faced Tuesday night with an undecided voter who was worried about climate change, but who didn't think he could afford to pay the costs associated with a carbon tax, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer offered a reassuring response: a Conservative government would repeal the federal carbon levy.  But then Scheer pushed his argument a step further. A carbon tax, he said, doesn't reduce emissions.  ""It's not working,"" he said. ""We saw in British Columbia, emissions go up in the most recent year, even though they've had a carbon tax for quite a long time. So, based on the fact that it's not working, why would we continue to go down that path?""  British Columbia's carbon tax, introduced by Gordon Campbell's government, came into effect in July 2008. It was initially set at $10 per tonne and increased $5 each year until it reached $30 per tonne in 2012.  It's more accurate to say British Columbia's annual emissions have remained at approximately the same level. In 2005, according to federal data, B.C. produced 63 megatonnes of greenhouse gas emissions. In 2017, the province's emissions totalled 62 megatonnes, a decrease of 1.8 per cent.     Got questions about the election? We've got the information you need. Text ""ELECTION"" to 22222 for our election toolkit. And if you've still got questions, ask us.    By that simple measure, not much has changed. But that doesn't mean the carbon tax hasn't worked.  Measuring the carbon tax's impact  Between 2005 and 2017, British Columbia's population and economy grew significantly — from 2008 to 2017, the province's economy grew by 23 per cent and the population increased by 17 per cent. In that respect, it is notable that B.C.'s emissions didn't also rise. (Over the same period, Alberta's emissions rose by 18 per cent.)  But to properly assess the impact of the carbon tax, you have to consider a counterfactual scenario in which the carbon tax was not in place.  Multiple studies have considered that question and those studies found the carbon tax was responsible for a decrease in fuel consumption and emissions. A study in 2016 linked the carbon tax with the purchase of more fuel-efficient vehicles.  ""The primary objective of the B.C. carbon tax is to reduce GHG emissions and essentially all studies show it is doing just that, with reductions 5–15 per cent below the counterfactual reference level,"" concluded a 2015 survey of published research.  A reduction of five to 15 per cent is not enough, on its own, to achieve Canada's international target, but it would be a significant contribution. The federal price is currently scheduled to reach $50 per tonne.  In their own defence, the Conservatives point to a study which observed that demand for diesel fuel was inelastic — that it's less likely to be affected by changes in price. But even that study estimated that the carbon tax in British Columbia had reduced the per capita use of diesel.  More broadly, the evidence also shows that British Columbia's economy has not suffered as a result of the carbon tax.    International examples of carbon pricing  British Columbia's carbon tax was the best example in Canada of a revenue-neutral carbon tax — one that offsets its cost with cuts to other taxes — though the province's use of the revenue has changed over time and the current government is pledging to use the revenue in different ways.  But it's not the only instance of carbon pricing being associated with a drop in emissions. Significant reductions have coincided with carbon levies in the United Kingdom, Sweden and Australia. The European Union has been covered by a cap-and-trade system since 2005 and its emissions have fallen by eight per cent (China is planning to launch its own cap-and-trade market in 2020).  The World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and more than 3,000 economists in the United States have expressed support for pricing carbon as a means to reduce emissions — in large part because implementing a price on emissions is likely to reduce emissions at the lowest possible cost to the economy. Though pricing policies are easier to attack, alternative policies to achieve comparable reductions will tend to be more expensive.  But economics is easier than politics.    The politics and the facts  A year after the Campbell government implemented a carbon tax, it had to fight for re-election against B.C. New Democrats who vowed to ""axe the tax."" Campbell's B.C. Liberals were re-elected, but his successor, Christy Clark, declined to increase the tax after 2012. As a result, the price stayed at $30 per tonne until, coincidentally, an NDP government raised it.     What you need to know to vote in the federal election    If Justin Trudeau's Liberals retain power after Oct. 21, a similar convergence on carbon pricing could occur at the federal level, with the Conservatives choosing to pursue a different line of attack.  In fact, shortly after condemning a broad-based carbon tax on Tuesday night, Scheer found himself praising his own plan to apply a carbon levy to large emitters (Scheer's plan would replace the Liberal regulations on heavy emitters with a policy that requires firms to invest an unspecified amount toward research or clean technology).  Regardless, Scheer's climate platform would result in higher emissions. But he can promise to repeal the federal carbon tax.  The undecided voter Scheer was faced with on Tuesday night was evidence that there is an audience for political leaders who promise to repeal carbon-pricing policies. Not even the federal rebate — and analysis showing that most families will receive more than they pay — was enough to convince the skeptical resident of New Brunswick.  All of which can be debated.  But that debate should be based on a real understanding of the options and the known merits of the policies that are being proposed.    ",technology
505,"Vegan pet food is out there, but is a plant-based diet good for your animals?","Whenever Rhiannon Whitney buys her two dogs a treat, the first thing she does is look on the back of the box for meat byproducts.  As a vegan for the last 17 years, both her canines eat an all-plant diet, and mostly organic.  ""It's not harder at all,"" she said from her East Vancouver apartment while pouring kibble into a bowl. ""I think it's actually less expensive if you're looking at a quality equivalent.""  She says she struggled with the decision when she first brought Zen home as a puppy nine years ago.  She wanted to avoid making a ""selfish"" decision at the cost of his health.    But she soon learned it was possible for her dogs to follow her vegan lifestyle and remain healthy. It just took some extra steps to ensure his nutrition was balanced.    Zen's diet is now made up of foods like vegan kibble, meat-free pepperoni treats and steamed veggies — kale is his favourite.  Her cat though, still eats meat-based products.  Different for cats  Experts say while humans and dogs are more likely to thrive as omnivores, it's much more difficult for felines.  ""It's pretty much impossible to make a nutritionally adequate diet for a cat without the use of some animal-based products,"" says Dr. Tammy Owens, as assistant professor of small animal nutrition in the Western College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon.  She says cats are biologically ""obligate carnivores"" meaning they need to eat meat.    Dogs can be vegetarian, but Owens says their digestive systems still aren't as ""flexible"" as humans are which can make it more challenging to digest plant-based proteins over animal-based ones.  ""It's not nearly as straightforward or as easy and safe as making a diet for them using sort of traditional ingredients,"" she said.  B.C. tops vegan dog food sales  According to a study published earlier this year, researchers at the University of Guelph in Ontario found 35 per cent of pet owners surveyed would be interested in feeding their animals a plant-based diet.  The greatest hesitation for pet owners appeared to be fulfilling nutritional needs.    In an email, national retailer Petsmart says its top selling vegan dog food brand is seeing double-digit growth year over year, although it remains a small part of the overall category.  Highest provincial sales for the product are in B.C.  Integrative veterinarian Dr. Radica Raj says she sees the trend growing in her North Vancouver practice, particularly from owners who have already cut animal products from their lives.    As a holistic practitioner, she has recommended vegetarian diets for some dogs who struggle with chronic illnesses or allergies.  ""I really do believe that plant-based diets are a way to healing,"" she said. ""It may not be appropriate for every single patient because they are all different.""    Once a dog does go vegetarian, she administers additional tests to ensure there are no nutritional deficiencies and talks to her patients about supplementary foods and vitamins.  She says she has two patients who currently feed their cats plant-based diets, but she doesn't recommend it.  If you want  to cut animal-based foods out of your pet's life, both experts say, it's best to speak to your veterinarian first.",technology
506,Baby elephant nursed back to health at Myanmar sanctuary,"Baby elephant Ayeyar Sein trumpets impatiently as a vet prepares her milk bottle and walks cautiously, her front left leg in a splint made of bamboo and cloth bandages.  The four-month-old calf was rescued from a hunter's snare trap in the forest of Myanmar's southwest Ayeyarwaddy region last month and is now being looked after by staff at the Wingabaw elephant sanctuary, an hour's drive northeast of Yangon.  ""When she arrived at the camp last month, her leg was terribly sore,"" said Than Naing Oo, the camp veterinarian, as he cleaned the injury. ""Now she is getting better as we treat her with medicine twice a day.""  Than Naing Oo said Ayeyar Sein's parents were nowhere to be seen near the trap and were most likely killed by poachers. Poachers kill elephants for their tusks and skin, which are used to make jewelry and traditional medicine, among other things.  ""The big challenge for us in taking care of baby elephants is to keep them alive,"" said Shwe Yi Win Htet, manager at the camp, adding that two young elephants had died in their care.    ""They do not have mothers to feed them and are instead fed with powdered milk. That's why all of us are looking after them very carefully. Our priority is to prolong their lives,"" she said.  Officials named the four-month-old calf Ayeyar Sein in accordance with the tradition of giving orphans the first name of the state where they are found.    Wingabaw elephant camp is a government-owned shelter and 20 elephants rescued from similar situations are currently kept there. Eight are orphaned baby elephants.  Ayeyar Sein will be raised with the other orphans in the camp after her injury has healed.  There are about 1,400 to 2,000 elephants left in the wild in Myanmar, while 5,000 are in captivity, according to a 2018 Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute report, which highlights elephant poaching as an emerging crisis in the Southeast Asian country.",technology
507,What really happens to the organic waste you put in your compost bin,"In many communities, residents are asked to separate food waste into bins for municipal composting.   In theory, composting can create a circular economy of food: it is grown, it is eaten, the scraps are thrown out and turned into fertilizer sold to farmers, who grow more food. But most consumers are unaware of what the composting process actually involves.   There are two kinds of municipal composting: aerobic (with oxygen) and anaerobic (without oxygen) digestion. In both cases, micro-organisms break down biodegradable material into compost that can later be used as fertilizer.  Aerobic digestion, also known as traditional composting, is the more low-tech, and is done in jurisdictions such as Metro Vancouver, Nova Scotia and Montreal (although the city has approved plans to build two new composting facilities, one of which will use anaerobic digestion).    In its simplest form, traditional composting requires making a pile of wet organic matter 一 made up of yard waste, food scraps and occasionally sewage 一 and waiting several months for the waste to break down into humus (which is compost that's mainly used for conditioning soil). This is something you can do in your backyard.  With anaerobic digestion, food waste is put in an oxygen-free environment, instead of being piled up and left in the open air.  Dianne Saxe, the former environmental commissioner of Ontario who now leads the consultancy Saxe Facts, said that, if left to the landfill, methane is released during the process, which can be used as a source of energy.  Instead, the methane — a potent greenhouse gas — is released into the atmosphere.  Anaerobic digestion  Anaerobic digestion is the less common variety of composting in Canada, but it's being used in the country's biggest city: Toronto.  The facility on Disco Road collects up to 45 per cent of Toronto's organic waste and converts it into something renewable. The air inside the facility is thick and heavy. The smell of rotting garbage is so strong you can feel it permeating your skin and sticking to your clothes.  During a recent visit, Derek Sawyer, supervisor of organic processing in Toronto, pointed to a towering pile of compost bin waste, all stuffed into bags of various colours and sizes.  The waste, all residential, sat wrapped in layers of plastic before it was piled onto conveyor belts by a large, green excavator, where it will be taken to a large, loud machine called the hydro pulper.    The hydro pulper is a large, whirring machine that uses water to remove non-compostable materials, known as contaminants. Sawyer said contaminants can comprise up to 18 per cent of every batch.  Those contaminants include items that residents are asked to put in the green bin, and that many believe to be compostable — such as disposable diapers and sanitary napkins.   The light materials — plastic bags, diapers, compostable forks and straws — float to the top of the pulper, where some are shredded and others are skimmed away by a giant claw machine. The screening isn't perfect — small shreds of plastic are still visible in the resulting compost — but it gets the amount of plastic low enough to meet standards.  The heavier contaminants — glass, metal, dirt and shells — fall to the bottom and caught in the catch basin of the hydro pulper before being removed. Even items that could be recycled, such as metal and glass, end up as garbage.  Recyclables head to dump  The organic waste becomes a sludge, ground up and sopping wet, before being  brought to large tanks called anaerobic digesters. In the digesters, micro-organisms, in the absence of oxygen, break down the material to produce the pre-compost stage — called digester solids — and release biogas, a mix of methane and carbon dioxide.     The digester solids are then sent to a third-party company — in this case, All Treat Farms, about two hours west of Toronto —  to be heated, aerated and turned into usable compost.  The biogas is filtered out with big fans, and used to mix and heat the anaerobic digesters, as well as burned to keep the facility warm during the winter months. Some of it is also used to heat the digester tanks in the facility.   Disco Road currently burns the remaining gas. In the future, the City of Toronto hopes to sell it as a more renewable and sustainable type of fuel used for heating and vehicles.   All liquids — liquid digestate, rainwater and all other water used on-site — is collected and purified so that it can supply most of the facility's water needs, mainly for drinking and to clean instruments.  Aerobic digestion  Aerobic digestion creates nutrient-rich fertilizer without diverting partially decomposed waste to a different facility.   It can still be a complicated, multi-step process, where staff measure how much water, air, carbon and nitrogen-rich materials go into the pile.  Each ingredient does its part in the decomposition process:      Oxygen oxidizes the carbon, which sparks the process.     Carbon produces the energy and heat needed.      Nitrogen encourages the growth and reproduction of micro-organisms.     Water maintains the microbes needed to decompose.     The process is started by shredding yard waste, adding water and regularly stirring or turning the pile. Bacteria and fungi that need oxygen to survive manage the decomposition by converting the materials not only into compost, but also into heat, carbon dioxide and ammonium.     This method can be shortened from months into just two to three weeks.  With both aerobic and anaerobic digestion, the final product — compost — is sold to farms, plant nurseries, grocery stores and garden centres.   But the majority of Canadian organic waste still ends up in the landfill. Ontario alone throws out two million tonnes a year, the Ontario government reports.  According to Saxe, looking at organic waste as a resource can help raise awareness and build an industry based on the principles of the circular economy.  ",technology
508,Mint's new glow-in-the-dark coin features Canada's most famous UFO,"The Royal Canadian Mint has issued a glow-in-the-dark coin that captures the eerie scene more than 50 years ago when awestruck witnesses reporting seeing what was officially documented as a UFO crash off southwestern Nova Scotia.  The colourful image on the rectangular coin shows three fishermen aboard a boat, staring and gesturing as the ghostly image of a flying saucer appears to plunge into the dark waters near Shag Harbour.  But something special happens when the included black-light flashlight is used to illuminate the coin in the dark: the spaceship disappears, but four orange lights remain in the sky, as described by those who reported seeing something that moonless night on Oct. 4, 1967.  ""Our coins always aim to tell the whole spectrum of the Canadian experience, from serious topics — like our veterans in remembrance, our technical achievements and amazing landmarks — to the stories that really surprise you,"" said mint spokesperson Alex Reeves.  ""We're looking forward to doing more of this kind of stuff as we tell the story of Canada.""    The pure silver collectors coins went on sale Tuesday for $129.95 each. By the end of the day, the mint's website said 95 per cent had been sold.  According to the mint, a number of the coins will be on sale at the annual Shag Harbour UFO Festival which starts on Oct. 4. At the festival, the mint will also hold a contest where people can win coins.  A total of 4,000 of the one-ounce coins will be produced, with some of them sent to dealers for retail sales. Considered non-circulating legal tender, each coin has a face value of $20.  The Shag Harbour incident is widely regarded as one of the world's best-documented UFO cases.  Among the witnesses were RCMP officers, scores of fishermen and airline pilots flying at 33,000 feet along the Gulf of Maine.  What witnesses saw  Most reported seeing a series of flashing lights moving at high speed and then hitting the water, about 300 metres from shore.  At 11:20 p.m., a glowing, orange sphere — described as being about the size of a city bus — slipped beneath the surface without a sound, leaving behind a strange, orange foam.  A series of searches, including a three-day scan of the harbour's floor, turned up nothing.  However, reams of police and military documents have since confirmed authorities had no idea what they were dealing with. There were specific references to unidentified flying objects, and no attempts were made to explain away what people had reported.  'Fascinated by UFOs and unexplained phenomena'  Subsequent theories have focused on Soviet submarines, experimental military aircraft from the United States and, of course, extraterrestrial beings.  ""We've always been fascinated by UFOs and unexplained phenomena,"" said Christa Bruce, the mint's product manager.  ""When we can take a really unique theme and a fantastic design, it's a perfect marriage that resonates with Canadians.""  The decision to highlight what happened at Shag Harbour was made after collectors quickly bought up the first coin in the mint's Unexplained Phenomena series.  Shag Harbour coin follows Falcon Lake one  In April 2018, the Crown corporation released a colourful, egg-shaped collectors coin that depicts Stefan Michalak's alleged close encounter with aliens near Falcon Lake, Man., in May 1967 — five months before the Shag Harbour sightings.  Michalak told authorities he was searching for precious metals in a park when he approached a silver, saucer-shaped craft that emitted a gas, setting his shirt on fire and leaving a distinctive burn pattern on his chest.  The Falcon Lake coin, which also glows under black light, shows Michalak laying on his back, his right arm stretched above his head as the spaceship hovers above him.  MORE TOP STORIES   ",technology
509,'Wrecked forever': Unique geological formation near Yellowknife almost gone,"What's 11,000 years old and likely almost all used up? The sandpits by the Yellowknife airport.  For decades, sand has been excavated from the popular multi-use recreation area for road and other construction projects.  It's left at least one longtime Yellowknifer wondering if the excavation will stop before there's nothing left of what is, in the Yellowknife area, a relatively rare natural formation.  Brent Horn has lived in Yellowknife for 49 years. He says he's been visiting the sandpits for a long time, and they're nothing like they used to be.  ""If you stood at that road by the shooting range, you couldn't see the other end of the sandpits for dunes,"" Horn recalled. ""If you were out there four-by-fouring or quading … you couldn't see who was on the other side of the hill. That's how much sand was out there.""  Horn said that was about 30 years ago, when he was a teenager. More recently, when he had dogs, he would take them to the sandpits, and he's been out there over the years with his daughters.    ""Now it's gone. It's all flat,"" he said.  ""This year I was out at the sandpits and I noticed there are trucks and tractors out there, piling up sand, and now it's got down to below the water table and it's just … a marshy quagmire of muck out there now.""  ""It's still going on and nobody seems to care,"" he said. ""It's going to be gone and it's going to be wrecked forever.""    What's been lost?  The area, described as recently as 2004 in a Yellowknifer newspaper article as ""a wide open area full of dunes, ponds and weathered rocks,"" is no longer anything of the sort.  Instead, it's a flattened-out and largely hard-packed surface. There are hints of what the area might once have been like in the deep, dry sandy fringes and outcroppings surrounding the soggy, sandy plain.  The sandpits are an 11,000-year-old deposit of glaciofluvial sediment formed where Glacial Lake McConnell once touched the Laurentide Ice Sheet.  A sandy formation of its size is relatively rare in the Northwest Territories, at least in the Yellowknife area, according to Philippe Normandeau, a research scientist with the N.W.T. Geological Survey who specializes in surficial geology.  ""It's one of the only areas where you have this much of it,"" Normandeau said. ""We have a lot more of it as you go further inland … but closer to the lake, they are fairly rare.""  The Yellowknife airport and large portions of Yellowknife itself are built on the same formation. It's unlikely Yellowknife would have the airport it has without it.    ""It's the only place around here where you can build an airport — like the one we have here — simply because of the area of flat ground that you can actually build something on that is well-drained,"" Normandeau said.  ""So it allowed for the airport.""  Yellowknife's golf course is developed on it, Long Lake Beach has the sandy shoreline it does because of it, and the Folk on the Rocks festival grounds are the dusty environs they are because of it.    But sand is also a useful resource.  ""It's a huge source of useful material for building roads [and] building highways,"" Normandeau said.  That usefulness explains why the sandpits are today as damp and stripped bare as they are. As sandy material was removed, the water table became exposed.  Normandeau said the formation sits on impermeable bedrock.  ""We've had two very wet summers recently. So you just add a lot of water in a place where the water can't get out … that's what you see now,"" he said.  Where's it gone? How much is left?  The sandpits as we know them today were exposed during various stages of excavation. Aerial photos show that excavation was well underway in earnest by 1970, with the gun range in place.    Before excavation began, the area looked very much unlike what it does today. Aerial photos from 1945 show there were more trees and less exposed sand.  According to an email from City of Yellowknife spokesperson Alison Harrower, the city holds 20 per cent of the sandpits area under a lease. The other portions are managed by the territorial Department of Lands or the federal government.  The portion of the sandpits leased to the city (highlighted in red in the image below) is for city capital projects and public works projects.    Harrower said the city ""is confident"" excavation at the sandpits this summer was done by an authorized contractor, at a rate of $2 per cubic metre.  ""If there are concerns regarding unauthorized use of the city's portion of this lease, the city welcomes public feedback,"" she said.  Harrower said it would be difficult to say how much sand is left in the leasehold, but she said the volumes remaining are estimated to be small. She said the city does not plan to let all the sand be removed, in part to ensure ""future community use is preserved and safe.""  ""There is a reclamation plan in place to prevent a complete dig-out of this specific area of the sandpits in accordance with GNWT [Government of the Northwest Territories] land lease requirements.""  Nothing else like it    Normandeau also does not suspect the deposit at the sandpits is very deep, given the surrounding topography. He said the sandpits likely won't become another Bristol pit, the quarried-out deposit that's now home to Yellowknife's sub-surface snowboarding hill.  ""It's not a very thick accumulation of sediment,"" he said. ""It wasn't even from the start. It covers a large area, but … you don't have huge cliffs around there that would leave very deep canyons under the sand.""  But once the sand is gone, recreational users would be hard-pressed to find anything similar, at least around Yellowknife.  ""Probably not of this size, not close to town … not as convenient, that's for sure,"" Normandeau said.",technology
510,Why did the female orgasm evolve? Experiment supports theory,"In humans, the female orgasm isn't required for reproduction, so scientists have long been puzzled about why it exists. Now, a new experiment on rabbits involving orgasm-suppressing antidepressants confirms an intriguing theory — that the reflex originally evolved to trigger ovulation.  Humans, other primates and rodents ovulate or produce mature eggs spontaneously (humans on a monthly basis). But in mammals such as rabbits and camels, ovulation typically needs to be triggered by mating.   Some years ago, Mihaela Pavlicev, then a researcher at the Boston Children's Hospital, was cataloguing information about the ovarian cycle in different mammals when she stumbled on a pattern — in animals where ovulation is induced by mating, the hormones involved are the same ones released during the human orgasm.  Further research showed that animals where ovulation is induced by mating had a different anatomy — their clitoris was inside the ""copulatory canal"" as opposed to outside, in the case of humans.   And the genetic relationships between the animals were consistent with the idea that both kinds of mammals shared a common evolutionary ancestor whose ovulation was triggered by mating.   Pavlicev hypothesized that what humans experience as female orgasm originally evolved to trigger ovulation, and it's a ""leftover"" trait that no longer has the same purpose.   ""It's a good suggestion, a good hypothesis with a lot of support, but we really wanted to test it somehow,"" said Pavlicev, now a professor at the University of Vienna.   She reasoned that if orgasm is really similar to induced ovulation in rabbits, then a drug that suppresses orgasm in humans should suppress ovulation in rabbits.    Suppressing orgasms (in both men and women) is a common side effect of antidepressants known as SSRIs. Pavlicev and her team chose to use a drug from that group called fluoxetine, which is sold under the trade names Prozac and Sarafem.  The researchers treated female rabbits with the drug for two weeks, then mated them with a male rabbit. They found that rabbits given fluoxetine had 30 per cent fewer ovulations — that is, they released fewer eggs — than rabbits that were not given the drug.  ""We were actually really, really happy that we actually got such a clear result,"" said Pavlicev, lead author of the study describing the results, published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  The orgasm-like reflex triggered by mating acts via the nervous system to release an ovulation-inducing hormone from the rabbit's brain.  To double-check that the Prozac wasn't suppressing ovulation directly, the researchers ran a second experiment where they gave that hormone to the rabbits treated with fluoextine, which restored the normal rate of ovulations.  What do rabbits feel?  While this shows ""copulation-induced ovulation"" is analogous to the human female orgasm and points to its origins, Pavlicev said, researchers don't know how it feels for the rabbit: ""We don't know whether they have the same experience as we do.""  Nor does it tell researchers why the trait still persists in humans, even though it doesn't appear to be useful in reproduction.  ""Does it really not have any function today?"" she wonders. ""What is it … that keeps it there?""  Previous theories about the reason female orgasms exist include the idea that it's for emotional bonding, or that it's a consequence of the fact that male and female bodies develop from the same body plan, and the male orgasm is typically required for reproduction.    Pavlicev says her research shows how important it is to look at evolution and animals to answer questions about ourselves: ""It's very often not possible to explain human traits just by looking at humans.""  She added that the difference in the location of the clitoris between mammals with induced ovulations and those that ovulate spontaneously also explains why some women have trouble reaching orgasm through sexual intercourse — something that some psychologists had previously blamed on mental health issues.  ""It's evolution,"" she said. ""It's not mental problems.""  The study was supported by the science development fund at Yale University, where the corresponding author of the study, Gunter Wagner, is an evolutionary biology professor, and partially funded by members of the public through the crowdfunding site experiment.com.  Gonzalo Renato Quintana Zunino recently completed his PhD at Concordia University studying how the brain learns from sexual experiences, and is familiar with studies about orgasms based on animal research. Zunino, who was not involved in the study, said in an email the results ""do offer a hint as to why women experience orgasm."" However, he noted that it doesn't say whether the rewarding aspect or pleasure of sex plays a role in what happens to the rabbits, although experiments with different drugs might be able to answer that question.  ""Animal studies are incredibly valuable to understand the origins and mechanisms of different phenomena, such as orgasms,"" he wrote in an email. But he noted they have limitations. ""There are also few animals, including humans, that engage in sex and sexual behaviours that are not conducive towards reproduction.""  He added that Pavlicev's hypothesis isn't the only possible explanation as to why women experience orgasm, and it doesn't mean the theory that female orgasm is a byproduct of male orgasm isn't true.",technology
511,'It's not a pipe dream': Oilsands company developing project to wipe out its emissions,"An Alberta oilpatch company is looking for government support toward a new project that aims to erase emissions from its oilsands facility and possibly from other nearby oil-producing operations.  MEG Energy is proposing to capture greenhouse gas emissions and bury them below the surface.  The company wants to achieve net-zero emissions and chief executive Derek Evans said this new development actually provides a tangible way to reach that goal.  ""It isn't a pipe dream,"" he said.  ""We're actually well beyond the dreaming stage. We've identified a place where we think we can sequester our greenhouse gas emissions. We think it's large enough to handle not only ours, but a large component of the people in the Christina Lake area and we think it's doable,"" he said.    Christina Lake is an area about 150 kilomtres south of Fort McMurray that is well-populated by oilsands development.  MEG Energy will provide more details within the next 12 months, according to Evans, and the pilot project should be operational within the next two years.  ""We're going to focus on net-zero emissions because we believe that's the end game and that's where we need to get to as quickly as possible,"" he said.    Evans made the comments during a wide-ranging interview with CBC News about the state of the industry and the current federal election campaign. The company would not provide any additional information about the carbon capture project such as its total cost, how much government funding it is pursuing or whether it is partnering with other oilsands companies.  Carbon capture growth  MEG Energy's facility already has above-average greenhouse gas performance compared to other oilsands projects, according to Kevin Birn, an analyst with IHS Markit. A carbon capture investment of this kind has the potential to create some of the lowest greenhouse gas intensive oil in North America, from a production standpoint.  ""You're talking about taking a resource that, I think, has a reputation for being higher carbon,"" said Birn. ""Removing the upstream emission profile from it would be massive.""  Two other oilsands facilities are within 50 kilometres of MEG Energy's oilsands operation, which Birn said provides the opportunity ""to build larger scale solutions and share those solutions with some of the other facilities.""      Carbon capture projects aren't new to the oilsands, although only a few of the facilities exist. Shell Canada opened its Quest project in 2015 which cost about $1.35 billion, backed with $745 million from the Alberta government and $120 million from Ottawa.   Earlier this year, Quest reached the milestone of four million tonnes of stored carbon dioxide, equivalent to the annual emissions of about one million cars.  That project removed almost nine per cent of the greenhouse gas intensity of the oilsands mining extraction sector, according to Birn.      Two years ago, a Shell Canada official had said future growth in the carbon capture industry would depend on carbon taxes rising to about $100 a tonne.  The economics have likely changed since then, but Evans said a higher carbon price would not only encourage more oilsands companies to fund carbon capture projects, but it would also create more awareness about the emissions issue.  ""We need a carbon tax. It would be nice if we weren't sitting around arguing about it, but it seems to be a political football today,"" he said.  ""Is it large enough to incent producers today to look more seriously at sequestering carbon? I'm not sure it's high enough yet.""    ",technology
512,"Over 1,650 killed this monsoon season in India","The heaviest monsoon rains to lash India in 25 years have killed more than 1,600 people since June, according to government data released Tuesday as authorities battled floods in two northern states.  The monsoon season, which typically lasts between June and September, has already delivered 10 per cent more rain than a 50-year average, and is expected to withdraw only after early October, more than a month later than usual.  The extended rains have wreaked havoc, with northern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar states the worst hit in the latest spell of downpours, killing 144 people since last Friday, two officials said.  In Patna, Bihar's riverside capital city that is home to about two million people, residents said they were wading through waist-deep water to buy essential items like food and milk.    Ranjeev Kumar, 65, a resident of Patna's Ashiyana neighbourhood, told Reuters by telephone that the entire area was stranded by the water.  ""The government is not doing any rescue and the situation is very serious here.""  Maharashtra the hardest hit state  On Monday, relief workers rescued Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi from his home in Patna. Video footage showed him dressed in shorts and a T-shirt as he was brought out on a raft along with his family members.  Saket Kumar Singh, who lives in the city's Boring Road area, said he was stranded for four days, with water about waist deep inside his house.  ""There was no electricity, and despite having money I was helpless,"" said Singh, 45.  In neighbouring Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, heavy rains have brought down more than 800 homes and swathes of farmland were submerged.    Data released by the federal Home Ministry shows 1,673 people have died because of floods and heavy rains this year, as of Sept. 29.  Officials said many fatalities were caused due to wall and building collapses, including in Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, the western state that has seen 371 flood-related deaths in 2019, the highest in the country.  ""The danger of old or weak structures collapsing increases during the heavy rainfall, like what happened this time,"" Chandrakant Sharma, a flood expert with Uttar Pradesh's disaster relief department, told Reuters.  India's flood prevention and forecasting systems are lacking, other experts say, even as the total flood prone area in the country has increased in recent decades because of deforestation, degradation of water bodies and climate change.

513,Liberal promise to end open-pen salmon farms in B.C. making waves on East Coast,"Canada's aquaculture industry is condemning a Liberal Party campaign promise to phase out open-pen salmon farms in British Columbia as ""reckless"" and ""irresponsible,"" while a Liberal candidate running for re-election in a salmon farming area in southern New Brunswick is also expressing reservations.  Karen Ludwig, who was elected MP for New Brunswick Southwest in 2015, said moving toward closed-containment systems, which involve farming fish in land-based tanks or in pens walled off from the open ocean, ""really is a long transition, if that's even going to happen.""  ""When we look at where science is at, I don't believe — from what I've researched and heard — that science is at this stage where we could go, where we can quickly make a transition to closed containment,"" she said.  Liberal incumbent Ken McDonald, running for re-election in the Newfoundland riding of Avalon, also showed no interest in seeing the policy applied in Atlantic Canada.  ""There are no discussions for this in anyway to apply to Atlantic Canada, nor would I support any policy to that effect,"" McDonald said in a statement to CBC news.    ""We will continue to stand up and protect aquaculture in Atlantic Canada.""  The Liberal platform unveiled last weekend promises to develop a plan to transition from open-pen salmon farms to closed-containment ones on the West Coast by 2025.  'Not grounded in science,' says industry group  Closed-containment systems are generally land-based, but they can also be in water provided the fish pens are separate or walled off from the open ocean. The goal in either case is to reduce escapes, water column pollution and the chemical treatments used in raising fish.  The Canadian Aquaculture Association and regional counterparts in Nova Scotia, P.E.I. and Newfoundland and Labrador issued a joint statement Monday denouncing the promise as ""not grounded in science"" and ""threatening"" jobs.  Canadian president Tim Kennedy said the industry was caught by surprise since it had been working with the Liberal government before the election to expand the life of the fish grown on land while continuing to farm them in the ocean.  ""What we're seeing with this commitment is a really reckless decision by the Liberal Party to move toward a technology that is not yet ripe, is not mature,"" Kennedy said.  ""So, it would have very serious potential consequences for employment across Canada and for sustainable food production.""  Salmon farms in Atlantic Canada  Kennedy said the promise also increases uncertainty in Atlantic Canada, even if the region's industry is not mentioned in the platform.  ""You can't impose something as a national government in one area and expect it not to have implications for the rest of the country,"" he said.  ""We have the same companies that are operating on both coasts, so it's a very, very negative signal.""  Ludwig said moving from a marine-based industry to closed containment across Canada would require land the size of approximately 25,000 football fields.  A Liberal Party spokesperson told CBC News the policy applies only to the West Coast.  Ludwig's in no rush to see it brought to Atlantic Canada, which she said has a different marine environment, pointing to the massive tides that sweep into the Bay of Fundy daily.  ""We're unique. We've had a very successful industry for 30 years. It may work in British Columbia. I'm not a representative from British Columbia, but I can say here that I will be working very closely with industry and be backing them up,"" Ludwig said.  Environmentalist wants to see policy go further  Environmental groups have long called for a transition from open-net fish farming to closed-containment aquaculture, which they say would protect the marine environment from the waste, chemicals, escapes and sea lice associated with open-pen salmon farming.  ""It's absolutely imperative that the industry be transitioned from open net-pen aquaculture with all of its environmental problems to closed containment,"" said Raymond Plourde, an environmentalist with the Halifax-based Ecology Action Centre.  ""But it must occur on both coasts because the impacts are exactly the same on both coasts.""  MORE TOP STORIES   ",technology
514,Big telecom companies win court battle in ongoing war with CRTC over wholesale internet rates,"The Federal Court of Appeal has issued a temporary stay of a CRTC decision that seeks to force Canada's biggest internet service providers to provide smaller rivals with access to their networks at new, lower wholesale rates.  Six of Canada's largest internet service providers, including Bell Canada and Rogers, asked the court on Sept. 13 to overrule an August decision by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission.  The phone and cable companies argue that the CRTC exceeded its powers and made errors when it decided had they had overcharged Canada's small- to mid-sized internet service providers under interim wholesale rates set in 2016.  Justice Yves de Montigny decided late last Friday that the CRTC's new wholesale rates will be suspended while the case is before the Federal Court of Appeal.    The judge also said that if the large internet service providers lose their appeal, they will be on the hook to repay overcharges collected from their wholesale customers since March 2016.  In its submission to the court, Bell estimated that its share of retroactive payments ordered by the CRTC would be about $100 million. A separate filing on behalf of six cable companies estimated their share would be $225 million.  In agreeing to the temporary stay of the CRTC's order, Montigny writes that the smaller ISPs do not dispute the seriousness of the issues raised in the appeal.    ""I am also satisfied that the implementation of the CRTC order could result in a permanent market distortion which could be extremely difficult to remedy afterwards,"" Montigny writes.  He concludes that the ""balance of convenience favours the status quo"" until the appeal is heard but stipulates that the large ISPs must ""provide an undertaking"" to pay damages if their appeals are dismissed.",technology
515,'Beefier barley' researcher says her work does not promote positives of climate change,"A university researcher whose work was used in controversial billboards around Edmonton and Calgary says her work was not intended to portray any positive effects of climate change.  ""It was not quite pleasant to see how your research results could be misinterpreted"" — in the ""beefier barley"" ads — ""but that's not something I can take control of,"" said Monireh Faramarzi, assistant professor of earth and atmospheric sciences at the University of Alberta  Faramarzi published research in 2017, exploring how climate change and increased carbon dioxide levels could potentially affect barley production in Alberta. A potential result could be higher barley yields despite less natural rainfall for crops, she found.   The research went relatively unnoticed in the broader public realm until recently, when billboards referencing it were used in the university's Truth Matters campaign.      The ""beefier barley"" billboards, displayed at four locations in Edmonton and Calgary, read, ""Climate change will boost Alberta's barley yield with less water, feeding more cattle.""  Critics say the billboards portray climate change positively.     University of Alberta vice-president resigns over 'beefier barley' billboards    ""If this was the strongest key message, I would definitely have considered this for the title of the paper. But the title of the paper doesn't say so,"" said Faramarzi on Monday.  ""That climate change would be something positive or negative … was definitely not the ultimate message of the paper.""  Faramarzi says her research focused on CO2 levels, but there were other factors like water temperature, soil moisture and nutrients that presented ""assumptions and limitations"" to the outcomes.  ""I think the key message of this paper is really specific to this barley yield with the assumptions and limitations that we had in our studies,"" she said.   The Truth Matters campaign focuses on highlighting research ""that tackles today's complex challenges, and to encourage discussion.""      You can't really have both sides of a nuanced and complicated argument on a billboard.  - Justin Archer, Berlin Communications     Public relations expert Justin Archer says the current federal election and protests surrounding climate change may have influenced public response to the billboards.  ""It just goes to show you that timing really is everything,"" said Archer, a partner at Edmonton-based Berlin Communications.   ""Right now at this moment in time there's a real thing going on around climate change and there's a real awareness and an awakening, particularly among young people.""  Archer believes the medium is also a factor in how the public viewed the message.  ""You can't really have both sides of a nuanced and complicated argument on a billboard,"" he said.     Young Alberta activists join global climate strikes   Climate change keeps dogging Scheer on campaign trail    The university's vice-president of university relations, Jacqui Tam, has resigned Sunday over the billboards. But Archer questions whether that was necessary.  ""If you think about the role of a professional communicator, you're supposed to generally take the information from your organization and put it out there,"" he said. ""As far as I can tell, that's what they were doing here.""  On Sunday, university president David Turpin said normal procedure was not followed in running the ad, which should have been vetted by the school's executive team. He declined further comment on Monday. ",technology
516,The climate change issue keeps dogging Andrew Scheer on the campaign trail,"Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer has been confronted by climate change activists at every stage of his travels during the federal election campaign, even though he hasn't shown a lot of interest so far in engaging with them.  In Saskatoon on Saturday, Scheer's rally was briefly interrupted by a dozen climate protesters brandishing signs demanding more robust efforts to fight against climate change.  Party supporters closed a garage door to drown out their chants and held their own signs higher to block the protesters from being seen by the 350 or so supporters assembled for the rally in Scheer's home province.  A day after Scheer skipped massive climate marches that saw tens of thousands of Canadians take to the streets Friday, one protester held a sign that asked ""Hey [Scheer!] Why were your hiding during #ClimateStrike?""  Scheer went out the back door after his stump speech in Saskatoon, avoiding the assembled activists entirely.  That protester with the sign was Carla Meckelborg, a mother of two. She said she wasn't looking for a confrontation — that she just wanted a chance to make her case for climate action to a party that is running neck-and-neck with the governing Liberals.  Too busy?  She said the Conservatives could form a government after Oct. 21 and she wants to make sure the party understands just how seriously even people in a resource-rich province like Saskatchewan take the issue.  ""They tell us he's too busy,"" Meckelborg said, reporting what she said was the response from party workers when she and the other protesters asked for a meeting with Scheer.  ""He chooses not to talk to us. Of course it would make a big difference if he did. We'd really like to talk to him about the climate crisis.    ""Andrew Scheer was the only leader in Canada that was nowhere to be found [at the climate marches]. That's a huge statement. By his actions, he says an awful lot. He says he has a climate plan but we don't believe he has a climate plan when he has actions like that.""    Climate activists have followed Scheer to other campaign events. His team cancelled a whistle-stop last Tuesday at the University of Waterloo Cambridge's School of Architecture, citing road construction issues and a tight schedule. Scheer and his team instead stopped at a local business — a hot dog stand.  Waiting for Scheer at the university campus were more than 50 climate activists who wanted to confront him about his record on the environment.  In Quebec City on Wednesday, the leader walked past two women who quietly unfurled a banner that read, ""Rebellion or Extinction.""    On Tuesday in London, Ont., a climate change scientist at nearby Western University wanted to speak to him about the climate ""crisis"" after a rally at a bar. Scheer pulled away to take pictures with the local candidate, Karen Vecchio, and supporters, before driving away to meet a departing plane.  On Sept. 20 in Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia, a handful of seniors showed up to a campaign stop with signs warning Scheer that there is no ""Planet B."" A Conservative partisan blocked the ladies from view with a large lawn sign. Scheer came within feet of the women but didn't stop to talk.    When asked about his reluctance to engage with climate activists, Scheer said he's open to meeting with Canadians ""that have something to say or have a question.""  Other 'activists'  He said he's not the only campaigning party leader being targeted by climate activists — that they're also frustrated with Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau and his record. He argued that, even with the federal Liberals' carbon tax, the country is on track to miss its Paris climate emissions reduction targets.  And he said he's been meeting with other ""activists"" who are being ignored by Trudeau: people in the oilpatch.  ""The activists that I'm here today supporting are the activists who want the energy sector back on its feet. The people here who want to be able to work. Those are the people I'm going to be a champion for,"" he said.    The Liberal Party has long sought to wedge Scheer on the environment issue.  For months, an orchestrated social media campaign led by Environment Minister Catherine McKenna and other Liberal MPs demanded that Scheer release a climate plan.  Scheer did deliver a 60-page climate platform in June — an unusually detailed plan from an opposition leader outside the writ period. The Liberal plan, by comparison, came out in a much shorter form ahead of the 2015 campaign.    But the substance of the Scheer plan isn't spoken of much at ""campaign engagement events"" — the nightly Conservative gatherings that have replaced the resource-intensive rallies of elections past.  Scheer's stump speech includes much talk of repealing the carbon tax, but little about the other measures included in his party's climate plan.  $1.8B for home renovations  The Conservatives' first climate-related announcement came nearly two weeks into the campaign — a promise to give Canadians up $3,800 each year over the next two years to complete green-friendly home renovations like replacing windows and doors, installing solar panels or upgrading ventilation.  When asked about the relatively hefty price tag ($1.8 billion) for a Conservative program that would reduce emissions by a relatively small amount (9 megatonnes), Scheer said the reno plan is also a promise to make life more affordable.      Need help preparing for election day? We've got the information you need. Text ""ELECTION"" to 22222 for our election toolkit. And if you've still got questions, ask us.     Scheer is steadfastly against a carbon tax — he's promised that his first order of business, if elected, would be its repeal — and he's been an ardent defender of the oil and gas industry at a time when the industry is under attack in some quarters.  But he hasn't abandoned the idea of government-coordinated climate action. His slogan on this issue — ""technology, not taxes"" — references a Conservative plan to invest more money in environmental innovations that can used here and abroad to reduce emissions.    The Conservative climate plan also calls for a $250 million investment in a ""green technology and innovation fund,"" a venture capital plan similar to the Canada Infrastructure Bank that would leverage public and private funds to help fledgling green tech companies and entrepreneurs secure the capital they need to grow.  Scheer has said he'd export more Canadian natural gas to Asia — a much less carbon-intensive fuel compared to coal, which dominates the energy mix on that continent — and seek international credit for the resulting reductions in countries using the cleaner Canadian fuel.  It might not be exactly what the most determined climate activists want, but it's not nothing. Still, Scheer doesn't seem eager to take the message to those who show up at his events intent on calling him a climate change denier.  ",technology
517,Engineered-in-Edmonton Twitter bot combats misogyny on the campaign trail,"Artificial intelligence programmers are attempting to combat misogyny on the federal campaign trail with a very positive Twitter robot.  ParityBOT is using artificial intelligence to identify hateful or abusive tweets directed at female candidates. In response, it spits out a positive tweet from the ParityBOT account.  Twitter bots are automated accounts run by software instead of human beings. They are programmed to automatically tweet, retweet, like and follow other Twitter accounts.  While many are designed to maliciously spam and troll users' timelines, ParityBOT has been engineered to send out empowering messages like, ""You are stronger than you know. Keep fighting.""      The software, which relies heavily on language filters, was engineered by Edmonton-based ParityYEG in collaboration with the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute and artificial intelligence scientist Kory Mathewson.  The non-human software could make the political sphere more humane for female candidates, one tweet at a time, said Alexandra Hryciw, a spokesperson for ParityYEG, an initiative created to empower more women to enter politics.   ""We got together a list of all women candidates running federally and then plugged them into the artificial intelligence bot,"" Hryciw said in an interview Monday with CBC Radio's Edmonton AM. ""It monitors all their accounts.""     Twitter bots emerge ahead of Canadian election, but influence is unclear    None of the tweets mention candidates and they don't single out any users. The supportive tweets are crowd-sourced from public submissions from across the country.  The bot will continue its campaign of positivity until election day.  ""We, as a group, decided that we were going to tackle misogynistic, sexist, harmful, racist and hurtful tweets directed at women candidates,"" Hryciw said. ""We're trying to raise the level of public discourse.""  Hryciw said the project was inspired by the litany of threats faced by Rachel Notley during her campaign and her time in the premier's office. Notley received at least 11 death threats, plus hate mail, vulgar photographs, unusual phone calls and a macabre incident involving a pre-arranged funeral application.      A wake-up call': Documents detail litany of threats against Premier Rachel Notley    Female politicians are subjected to disproportionate levels of harassment, said Hryciw. Too often the vitriol discourages them from pursuing their political aspirations.  ""The No. 1 barrier is this hateful social media and the domino effect that hateful social media has on their lives,"" she said.   ""It's not only directed at them, it affects their campaign teams, it affects the people managing their social media sites and it also affects their families.""       The first iteration of the project — launched during the Alberta provincial election earlier this year — was soon overwhelmed by abusive messages, Hryciw said.   The program processed more than 12,000 tweets during the provincial writ period, tracking 54 nominated candidates from March 19 until April 16. It sent out 973 positive tweets through the writ period but it could have sent out more, Hryciw said.   The bot detected so many abusive messages the team had to modify its algorithm and put a cap on the number of positive messages it could send, Hryciw said.   ""It was so overwhelming.  There was so much negative content coming in that the bot was picking up that we just had to say, we're not going to be able to respond to every single one.""",technology
518,"Diahann Carroll, Oscar-nominated actress and singer, dies at 84","Diahann Carroll, the Oscar-nominated actress and singer who won critical acclaim as the first black woman to star in her own TV series in a non-servant role, has died. She was 84.  Carroll's daughter, Susan Kay, told The Associated Press her mother died Friday in Los Angeles of cancer.  During her long career, Carroll earned a Tony Award for the musical No Strings and an Academy Award nomination for Claudine.  But she was perhaps best known for her pioneering work on Julia. Carroll played Julia Baker, a nurse whose husband had been killed in Vietnam, in the groundbreaking situation comedy that aired from 1968 to 1971.  Although she was not the first black woman to star in her own TV show (Ethel Waters played a maid in the 1950s series Beulah), she was the first to star as someone other than a servant.    NBC executives were wary about putting Julia on the network during the racial unrest of the 1960s, but it was an immediate hit. It had its critics, though, including some who said Carroll's character, who is the mother of a young son, was not a realistic portrayal of a black American woman in the 1960s.  ""They said it was a fantasy,"" Carroll recalled in 1998.  ""All of this was untrue. Much about the character of Julia I took from my own life, my family.""  'A profile regal enough to belong on a coin'  Not shy when it came to confronting racial barriers, Carroll won her Tony portraying a high-fashion American model in Paris who has a love affair with a white American author in the 1959 Richard Rodgers musical No Strings.   Critic Walter Kerr described her as ""a girl with a sweet smile, brilliant dark eyes and a profile regal enough to belong on a coin.""  She appeared often in plays previously considered exclusive territory for white actresses: Same Time, Next Year, Agnes of God and Sunset Boulevard (as faded star Norma Desmond, the role played by Gloria Swanson in the 1950 film.)  ""I like to think that I opened doors for other women, although that wasn't my original intention,"" she said in 2002.    Her film career was sporadic. She began with a secondary role in Carmen Jones in 1954 and five years later appeared in Porgy and Bess, although her singing voice was dubbed because it wasn't considered strong enough for the Gershwin opera. Her other films included Goodbye Again, Hurry Sundown, Paris Blues, and The Split.  The 1974 film Claudine provided her most memorable role. She played a hard-bitten single mother of six who finds romance in Harlem with a garbage man played by James Earl Jones.  In the 1980s, she appeared in the long-running prime-time soap opera Dynasty for three years. More recently, she had a number of guest shots and small roles in TV series, including playing the mother of Isaiah Washington's character, Dr. Preston Burke, on Grey's Anatomy.    She also returned to her roots in nightclubs. In 2006, she made her first club appearance in New York in four decades, singing at Feinstein's at the Regency. Reviewing a return engagement in 2007, a New York Times critic wrote that she sang Both Sides Now with ""the reflective tone of a woman who has survived many severe storms and remembers every lightning flash and thunderclap.""  From fashion to the stage  Carol Diann Johnson was born in New York City and attended the High School for the Performing Arts. Her father was a subway conductor and her mother a homemaker.  She began her career as a model, but a prize from Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts TV show led to nightclub engagements.  In her 1998 memoir Diahann, Carroll traced her turbulent romantic life, which included liaisons with Harry Belafonte, Duke Ellington, Miles Davis, Sammy Davis Jr., Sidney Poitier and David Frost. She even became engaged to Frost, but the engagement was cancelled.  An early marriage to nightclub owner Monte Kay resulted in Carroll's only child, Suzanne, as well as a divorce. She also divorced her second husband, retail executive Freddie Glusman, later marrying magazine editor Robert DeLeon, who died.    Her most celebrated marriage was in 1987, to singer Vic Damone, and the two appeared together in nightclubs. But they separated in 1991 and divorced several years later.  After she was treated for breast cancer in 1998, she spoke out for more money for research and for free screening for women who couldn't afford mammograms.  ""We all look forward to the day that mastectomies, chemotherapy and radiation are considered barbaric,"" Carroll told a gathering in 2000.",entertainment
519,"Is Joker dangerous, unsettling or 'random button-pressing?' ","Audiences are accustomed to hype and hot takes for every new comic book movie release, but the controversy surrounding Joker has reached a fever pitch.  In early September, the supervillain origin story captured the venerable Venice Film Festival's top prize. Ever since, however, director Todd Phillips, who also co-wrote the script, has been increasingly on the defence as the critical discussion has shifted between praise for Joaquin Phoenix's unsettling performance to criticism for lionizing a character who is a troubled, violent killer.  In particular, a segment of reviewers has characterized the film as a ""toxic rallying cry for self-pitying incels,"" referring to the misogynistic ""involuntary celibate"" online subculture of heterosexual men who express resentment of, and advocate violence against, women and men they deem more sexually successful.  Real-world reactions have compounded the hubbub surrounding the film, which officially opens Friday.  Victims of the 2012 mass shooting in Aurora, Colo., have expressed concern. Some theatre chains have banned dressing up for Joker screenings. The U.S. military warned service members about the potential threat of mass violence at screenings, while police in Los Angeles and New York plan to increase their presence at cinemas this weekend.    Joker's studio also axed red carpet interviews at the movie's Hollywood premiere last week, noting that, ""A lot has been said about Joker and we just feel it's time for people to see the film.""  We asked three critics who've seen Joker to share their views of the film and the heated discussion about it.  (Comments have been edited and condensed.)    'A movie that feels a little dangerous as you're watching it'    Justin Chang, Los Angeles Times and NPR film critic:   ""Whether we should be celebrating a movie like Joker — that's a very fair and good question. Whether the movie should exist is the question that I'm hearing a lot, too, and, 'Is this a movie that makes the world a worse place?'  ""I have complicated feelings about that because I admire the movie — not without some reservations, some of them esthetic, some of them moral ... Yet, at the same time, I'm very reluctant to censor anything or even censure anything, just because it has that element of danger to it.  ""This is a movie that feels a little dangerous as you're watching it and that is a testament also to how well done it is ... Some are saying it's sort of turning Joker into a mascot for the incel movement, although whether he's a mascot or whether he is a cautionary tale, I think there is room for argument there.   ""I think it's a good movie. Do I think we might be better off if it didn't exist? Possibly.     ""Watching this movie several weeks after the recent spate of mass shootings in America ... it's hard to get away from that. And I think that's not just because it's a violent movie — because Hollywood makes violent movies every day. There is something singular about what the director, Todd Phillips, and the actor, Joaquin Phoenix, have achieved in their collaboration that feels very dangerous and very close to the skin.  ""Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy — Martin Scorsese's movies — are two of the foremost influences on Joker. It's not on that level, I don't think, but you know Taxi Driver famously inspired violence. No one disputes that it's a great film. No one wishes that movie didn't exist. Joker is not in the same artistic league [but] I think it's safe to say that perhaps its ability to foment violence or its latent potential ... to tap into something dangerous is vastly greater than Taxi Driver's was, especially just by dint of how many years it's been and just how much easier it is to kill people now in the 21st century.""     Writers sent 'death threats for just voicing their concerns'     Kathleen Newman-Bremang, senior writer for Refinery29 Canada:  ""It's unsettling in general to uphold a murderer as a hero and I think that the the filmmakers and the director would say that that's not what their intention was ... But I think that a lot of people are going to look to [the character of Arthur Fleck, who becomes Joker] and see his social isolation and see how he's bullied and how society kind of pushes him to crime and to violence. And I think they're going to relate to that. That's really scary to me, especially now, when we have seen so many lonely white men ... incite violence against women, against society and they feel like they can justify it. I think this film is going to be something they use to justify it as well.  ""The other layer of this, which is why it's so dangerous, is because Joaquin Phoenix does an incredible job. He did a really good job of making this movie and making this character someone you want to care about.  ""[Arthur is] an unreliable narrator [and] some people might say, 'Well, you can't really trust the story that he's telling.' But the story that he's telling is that he is getting bullied and that he is getting beaten. We see him get beaten and bullied and people be really mean to him. And when you watch someone being attacked in that way — if you're a human being who has empathy — you're going to feel bad for him and you're going to want to be on his side. And that is what the film does: it completely leads up to the violence with justifications on every turn.    ""[After watching it], I walked into Yonge-Dundas Square, which is a very populated place, and I was scared. The only solace I had in that moment was that, 'Oh, everyone else hasn't seen this movie yet' ... I wrote a piece about it, and I got some really horrible e-mails. I know writers who received death threats for just voicing their concerns about this movie. You're already seeing this group of trolls online who relate to this movie [and] who are threatening a woman because of it. We're already seeing that: it's happening online right now.  ""A filmmaker has every right to make whatever movie they want ... But it's also my responsibility as a critic and as a fan to put that work — to put your art — into context of where we are right now.  ""[Director and co-writer] Todd Phillips has talked a lot about how he wanted this to be rooted in reality ... We know it's not a documentary. We know that this is a movie with actors. But once you place it that far into reality and go through extra pains to make sure it feels real and authentic and that it could have happened ... because of the political route they sort of go down with [Arthur] being this hero of the 99 per cent, you can't go down that route and not expect me to talk about politics and talk about society.""     'A piece of entertainment that's trying to agitate people'    John Semley, Toronto-based freelance writer and film critic:  ""I do not think Joker is dangerous. I do not think that this, or any film on its own, can have a direct causal relationship to real-world violence.  ""If we want to talk about incel violence — or the groups that are sort of being named, who this film is supposedly pitched to — there's so much more going on that leads them to those subcultures. There's so much that leads to their sort of violent behaviour and their toxic thoughts that the idea of blaming it on any one film just seems like a cheap 'out.'  ""I feel like the filmmaker is playing into the controversy to create this idea that this is a very dangerous film when, I think, in reality it's a sort of confused and muddled and occasionally competently made film that does not deserve any of this attention ... He's trying to have it both ways at once. I think that he does sort of glorify the character and he does sort of glorify these acts of violence while simultaneously saying, at least in the press, 'No, no. This is not what I'm doing.'     ""Even if this is a glorification or some sort of incitement, it's still a piece of art — if you want to call it that — or at the very least, entertainment. When we start censoring these things or saying, 'These should not exist, these are dangerous,' we get on a very slippery slope.   ""The film draws its influence very obviously from Martin Scorsese: from the character that Robert De Niro plays in Taxi Driver [and] from the character that De Niro plays in The King of Comedy. It's nowhere near on the same level as those two movies. I think it's closer to something like Michael Winner's Death Wish with Charles Bronson, where it's about a sort of frail liberal conscience that becomes corrupted and turns to violence.    ""The head spaces that [these filmmakers] invite you to get in, they're worth exploring. But it's how they're explored: is there a level of sophistication and nuance as there is in a film like Taxi Driver? Or is this just kind of random button-pressing, like it is in Joker? But I maintain, again, even if it is bad, it still has a right to exist.  ""This controversy around it, I worry, will only make people take it more seriously. I wish that we could just kind of look at this film for what it is, or what I think it is, which is just like a muddled piece of entertainment that's trying to agitate people and incite them. Not incite them to violence, but incite them to have these sort of hysterical reactions to it.  ""There are certainly things that I find offensive, that I find disgusting, that I find reprehensible, but I would never want to sort of enforce those as some standard that everyone has to follow.""",entertainment
520,Addicted to Fortnite? Montreal law firm says video game company should pay up,"A Montreal legal firm has requested authorization to launch a class-action lawsuit against the widely popular video game Fortnite.  The legal notice, filed on behalf of the parents of two minors, aged 10 and 15, likens the effect of the game to cocaine, saying it releases the chemical dopamine to the brain of vulnerable young people who can become dependent on playing.  ""We dug into it and we realized there was a strong case for it,"" said Alessandra Esposito Chartrand, an attorney with Calex Légal.    Chartrand said her firm was contacted by parents interested in suing the company for producing such an addictive game. She is asking others concerned about their child's dependence on the game to come forward.  The authorization request was filed in Montreal court Thursday against U.S.-based Epic Games Inc. and its Canadian subsidiary.  Much of the suit is based on a 2015 Quebec Superior Court ruling that determined tobacco companies didn't warn their customers about the dangers of smoking.  ""It's basically the same legal basis,"" Chartrand said. ""It's very centred on the duty to inform.""  That multi-billion-dollar tobacco lawsuit is still playing out in court as the three implicated companies look to secure creditor protection.  Tobacco empires have been built over centuries, but Fortnite is proving to be a modern-day cash crop of its own. Epic Games is now worth billions of dollars, largely because of the game's success.  Game made to be 'as addictive as possible,' lawyer alleges  That success was built from extensive research and development that was aimed at creating an addictive game, Chartrand said.  ""Epic Games, when they created Fortnite, for years and years, hired psychologists — they really dug into the human brain and they really made the effort to make it as addictive as possible,"" she said.  ""They knowingly put on the market a very, very addictive game which was also geared toward youth.""    When something is that dangerously addictive, it's a company's responsibility to warn users of the risk, she said.   ""In our case, the two parents that came forward and told, 'If we knew it was so addictive it would ruin our child's life, we would never have let them start playing Fortnite or we would have monitored it a lot more closely,'"" she said, noting there are treatment centres around the world and in even in Quebec that are helping users quit Fortnite.  The 38-page request of authorization highlights the research behind video game addiction and makes note of the World Health Organization's 2018 decision to classify video game addiction as a disease.    Chartrand was unable to say how much money her firm would seek or when a judge will rule on the class-action request.  Fornite is a free-to-download game that earns much of its revenue through in-game purchases. Players can upgrade their characters by purchasing outfits, accessories and access to certain levels.  Class-action waiver included in terms of service  Epic Games did not immediately reply to a request for comment early Friday. The company's terms of service includes a class-action waiver provision.  To play the game, users must give up the right to go to court individually or as part of a class-action. Instead, disputes must be resolved in individual arbitration, the terms say.    But Chartrand said such terms of service don't stand up in court in Quebec because the province's Consumer Protection Act requires companies to clearly disclose risks associated with products or services.  Epic Games is also facing legal action in California and she expects more cases will be launched elsewhere.  The most recent version of the game, Fortnite Battle Royale, has more than 125 million players worldwide.",entertainment
521,Winnipeg comedy club defends decision to book Louis C.K. despite sexual misconduct,"An American comedian and actor who admitted to sexual misconduct will take the stage at a Winnipeg comedy club next week but not everyone is lining up for tickets.  ""No one seemed to know he was coming here, it was very hush-hush,"" said Winnipeg comedian Carole Cunningham on CBC Radio's Up to Speed with Nadia Kidwai.  ""Obviously the reason for that is so there wouldn't be protest, so there wouldn't be a lot of discussion about it.""  In 2017, five women accused Louis C.K. of sexual misconduct. He released a statement soon after acknowledging the allegations were true.   His TV and streaming deals were cancelled and his film, I Love You, Daddy, was shelved.  C.K. has six shows scheduled over three days next week at Rumor's Restaurant and Comedy Club.    Cunningham said news of the shows raised some eyebrows within the city's comedy scene.   ""From the women, and some of the men, there is concern, this isn't something that we really wanted Winnipeg to be put on the map for in terms of comedy,"" she said.  C.K.appeared at Toronto's Yuk Yuk's Comedy Club on Wednesday for the first of five sold-out nights, and opened his show by addressing the scandal, but not in a way that was apologetic, said Cunningham.  ""He basically normalized and minimized what he did, and he told men in the audience, 'You know we're the same, just your dirty sexual secrets are still secrets,'"" she said.  Some posts on social media also expressed concerns over the Winnipeg shows and some condemned the Winnipeg club for the booking.      Tickets sold out  Despite the negative online reaction, the club is defending the booking and says all six shows sold out in a matter of hours.  ""To tell you the truth it seemed like the public voted with their wallets on this one. We sold out in two hours and we have a waiting list of 100 people looking for tickets,"" said the club's general manager and booker Tyler Schultz.  ""We felt that there was definitely a huge market of people who were interested in what he had to say and to see him say it live.""  Schultz said he wasn't overly concerned about the backlash because the people expressing those views aren't their typical customers.  ""We're not trying to force anybody to be at a show that they don't want to be at,"" he said.    Schultz said the show wasn't promoted on their social media page because all 1,500 tickets sold before that could happen. He said members of the restaurant's birthday club got first pass at the $39 tickets.  ""It went much quicker than even we anticipated,"" said Schultz.   ""We sent the email out at 8:30 [Wednesday] night and by 10:30 all the tickets were gone.""    Schultz said he's received some complaints about the booking but the majority of the response from customers has been positive.  ""We've seen a couple people who have sent us emails. For every one that we get where some people are concerned about him performing here, we have about 20 more from people who are looking for tickets,"" he said.  'We don't really believe in censoring our comics'  Schultz said the booking is not a reflection of the club's stance on C.K.'s behaviour, nor does it mean that those who attend the show have excused it.  ""I don't think anybody really condones that behaviour, I think that it happened a very long time ago and he's apologized and he's lost a lot in his career from it,"" he said.  ""In the whole Me Too movement he was the only one who took ownership of it and instead of trying to lie about what happened he was truthful.""    Cunningham disagrees and says C.K. hasn't done enough to make amends and says at the Toronto show C.K. tried to come across as a victim of his circumstance.  '""One of his lines was '52 years old and starting over' sort of thing, like, none of it was really apologetic,"" she said.  While Cunningham said she didn't have a timeline of when it would be appropriate to return to the stage, she said it was more about what he plans to do going forward.    ""When he does come back what is he making of it? Is he apologetic? No. Had he used this time out to really reflect on what he's done? No. Has he come and talked about and apologized to each and every one of his victims? No.""  Schultz said it's up to people to decide if they want to attend and anyone opposed is free to feel that way.  ""I understand that there is some people out there who are concerned about him performing in Winnipeg but I think the majority are very interested in what he has to say,"" he said.  ""We believe in letting artists do their art. His art is stand-up and he wants to come and perform here and we don't really believe in censoring our comics.""",entertainment

523,Banksy's chimp-depicting Devolved Parliament sells for more than $16M,"A large Banksy painting depicting primates sitting in the U.K. Parliament sold for more than $16 million Cdn on Thursday — a record price at auction for a work by the secretive British street artist, according to Sotheby's.  Devolved Parliament, in which chimpanzees replace politicians in the British House of Commons, more than comfortably surpassed its estimated price tag of 1.5 million to 2 million pounds ($2.4 to 3.3 million), with the auctioneer declaring ""history being made"" at one point during the sale which was streamed live.    After bidding that lasted some 13 minutes, the 2009 artwork from a private collection sold to loud applause for a hammer price of 8.5 million pounds, to which fees are added giving a final price of 9,879,500 pounds ($16.2 million).  ""Record price for a Banksy painting set at auction tonight. Shame I didn't still own it,"" Banksy wrote on his Instagram feed beside a post quoting art critic Robert Hughes about the value of artwork.  ""… The price of a work of art is now part of its function, its new job is to sit on the wall and get more expensive. Instead of being the common property of humankind the way a book is, art becomes the particular property of someone who can afford it,"" the Instagram post quoted Hughes as saying.    Before Thursday's sale, the auction record for a Banksy work was $2,494,000 for Keep it Spotless which sold at Sotheby's in New York in 2008, according to the auction house.  Devolved Parliament measures four metres long, making it Banksy's largest known canvas, according to Sotheby's.  Despite being painted in 2009, many commentators had drawn comparisons to current-day politics, namely the increasingly brutish exchanges in the House of Commons over Britain's pending departure from the European Union.  Watch Sotheby's Emma Baker explain the fortuitous timing of the Banksy auction:    The Bristol-born artist, who keeps his identity a secret, is known for his political or social-commentary graffiti work that has popped up in cities around the world.  Thursday's sale came a year after another Banksy canvas, Girl with Balloon, shredded itself in front of shocked onlookers at a Sotheby's auction just as it was sold.",entertainment
524,James Franco's ex-students sue alleging sexual impropriety,"Two actresses sued James Franco and the acting and film school he founded Thursday, saying he intimidated his students into gratuitous and exploitative sexual situations far beyond those acceptable on Hollywood film sets.  Sarah Tither-Kaplan and Toni Gaal, former students at the actor's now-closed Studio 4, said in the lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court that Franco pushed his students into performing in increasingly explicit sex scenes on camera in an ""orgy type setting.""  Franco ""sought to create a pipeline of young women who were subjected to his personal and professional sexual exploitation in the name of education,"" the lawsuit alleges.  The women say students were led to believe roles in Franco's films would be available to those who went along.  The situations described in the lawsuit arose during a master class in sex scenes that Franco taught at the school, which he opened in 2014 and closed in 2017.  The lawsuit, which also names Franco's production company Rabbit Bandini and his partners as defendants, includes allegations Tither-Kaplan made publicly last year after Franco won a Golden Globe Award for The Disaster Artist.  Gaal is speaking out for the first time.  Actor's lawyer fires back  In an interview on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert last year, Franco called the sexual misconduct stories about him inaccurate, but said, ""If I've done something wrong, I will fix it. I have to.""  The 41-year-old actor's attorney Michael Plonsker said the claims in the lawsuit are ""ill-informed"" and have ""already been debunked.""  ""James will not only fully defend himself, but will also seek damages from the plaintiffs and their attorneys for filing this scurrilous publicity seeking lawsuit,"" Plonsker said in a statement.  The lawsuit alleges that to take Franco's master class, students had to audition by simulating sex acts on film, which he watched to choose candidates.  It says the class began with ""encouraging female student actors to appear topless, then perform in sex scenes, then orgies and gratuitous full nudity,"" without the careful guidelines and closed sets that are the industry standard for shooting sex scenes.  The suit alleges that Gaal was kept out of the master class for questioning its exploitative nature.  Tither-Kaplan took the class and was subsequently cast in Rabbit Bandini films, ""which she now recognizes was a direct result of her willingness to accept Franco's exploitative behaviour without complaint.""  The lawsuit seeks damages to be determined at trial, an apology from Franco and his partners, and the handover or destruction of video of the plaintiffs.  Attorneys for the women are looking for more plaintiffs to join, and for it to become a class action.  Allegations emerged amid #MeToo  Tither-Kaplan previously recounted her experiences with Franco and the school as one of five women who talked to the Los Angeles Times about him early in 2018.  She was also among the women who spoke out against Franco on Twitter when he won his Golden Globe in January 2018 at a time when the #MeToo movement was surging.  Tither-Kaplan later told the L.A. Times that the Time's Up anti-sexual harassment lapel pin Franco wore to the ceremony felt like ""a slap in my face.""    The organization behind the pin, Time's Up Now, said in a statement Thursday that ""If these allegations are true, we hope the survivors, and all impacted by this behavior, receive some measure of justice.""  Since the allegations first emerged, Franco has made few publicity appearances, but work has not seemed to slow down for him on the big or small screen.  The HBO series The Deuce, which he executive produces and stars in, began its third and final season on Sept. 9.    Franco also appeared last year in the Coen brothers' acclaimed Western anthology The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, which was nominated for three Oscars.  And this weekend he will have two films that he directed and stars in playing in theatres: Zeroville, an adaptation of Steve Erickson's 2007 novel that was filmed in 2014 but faced delays in distribution, and Pretenders, with Brian Cox and Dennis Quaid.  Zeroville, which co-stars Seth Rogen, Megan Fox and Will Ferrell, is already a box office bomb and critical dud. This past weekend it played on 80 screens and made an average of $111 US per screen. Pretenders, which opens in limited release Friday, is not faring much better with critics.",entertainment
525,"Roger Taillibert, architect of Montreal's Olympic Stadium, dead at 93","Roger Taillibert, the French architect who designed Montreal's Olympic Stadium for the 1976 Olympic Games, has died in Paris.  He was 93 years old.  The stadium, with its retractable roof and 175-metre leaning tower, is one of Montreal's most famous buildings.  In addition to this stadium, Taillibert designed the Montreal Olympic Pool and the Montreal velodrome — now the Montreal Biodôme ​​​​​.   Outside of Montreal, Taillibert's work included the Park de Princes stadium in Paris and skyscrapers in Doha, Qatar.   Taillibert was asked to design the Olympic Stadium by Mayor Jean Drapeau, who saw Taillibert as a great artist, and gave him artistic freedom when it came to the stadium.    ""Taillibert is the kind of architect who built the cathedrals of ancient times,"" said Drapeau, calling Taillibert's designs ""poems in concrete.""  Taillibert himself said that he hoped the curves of his buildings would arouse emotional responses.    ""If a monument brings emotion, there is immediately a permanent presence of the monument among men,"" he said.     For others, however, Taillibert and his famous stadium were controversial choices.   Canadian architects were frustrated that a French architect was chosen to design Olympic buildings in a Canadian city, with Canadian architect Arthur Erickson calling the decision to tap Taillibert a ""national disgrace"" on CBC Radio.  Construction on the stadium was also fraught with cost overruns, labour strikes and walkouts, which heightened fears that the stadium would not be completed in time for the Games.     By the time the Games began, the stadium was functional but the tower was not completed and the retractable roof had not yet been installed.  After the Olympics, the stadium continued to face problems, like ice damage causing the roof to be repaired several times, and concrete slabs falling from the ceiling of its underground parking facility.  Officials are still considering installing a new retractable roof.    The stadium remains an icon in the Montreal skyline, despite its controversial past.  Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante tweeted Thursday that Taillibert leaves behind a great legacy in Montreal.  ""The Olympic Stadium is known around the world and has given us some great moments in our history,"" she wrote.  Taillibert often responded to his critics with a cool blanket statement: ""There are always critics; only those who do nothing have no critics.""",entertainment
526,Unapologetic Louis C.K. hits the stage in Toronto for first of 5 sold-out nights,"No cellphones, no recording devices, no apologies. Comedian Louis C.K. took the stage at Toronto's Yuk Yuk's Comedy Club on Wednesday for the first of five sold-out nights, with strict restrictions on audience recordings, but few limitations on his repertoire of jokes.  The 52-year-old comedian walked onto the stage in his signature black T-shirt and jeans to uproarious applause from the audience of about 250, and immediately tackled the subject of how his life has changed since a sexual misconduct scandal rocked his career.   In November 2017, five women accused the American comedian and actor of sexual misconduct. He quickly released a statement acknowledging the allegations were true. His actions resulted in cancelled TV and streaming deals as well as his new film, I Love You, Daddy, being shelved.   Reflecting on the two years since the scandal broke, he told the mostly male audience Wednesday they were lucky the whole world did not know their secret ""thing"" the way everyone now knows his. ""My thing is: I like to masturbate, and I don't like to be alone.""  Self-deprecating humour was partially what made C.K. a star — and that was apparent in his Toronto performance. But did the comedian offer a show of contrition to his accusers? Not exactly.  That didn't appear to matter to audience members, who responded enthusiastically throughout the set.  ""I was a little curious to see if he was going to address the allegations and all that stuff, and he did,"" fan Matthew Bunt said as he left the show. ""I think he did in a very funny and entertaining way,""  Alicia Xavier agreed: ""I loved it, he was relevant, dry and funny, everything I expected and everything I loved about him.""  Too soon for a comeback?  Louis C.K. made his return to standup comedy in August 2018 with an unannounced appearance at the Comedy Cellar in New York. The show was a hit, prompting a 15-minute standing ovation. Since then, he has performed a string of standup gigs at mid-sized venues around the U.S., shows announced without much lead time or publicity, in places like Brooklyn, N.Y., and Cleveland.  He's also set to perform six, already sold-out shows at Winnipeg's Rumors Restaurant and Comedy Club next week.   Cellphones and recording devices have been forbidden at the comedian's recent shows (a common practice now for comedians fearing their material would be plagiarized or illegally broadcast). Even note-taking was deemed grounds for ejection from the audience.  But word of the comedian's comeback — and the content of the shows — still got out, prompting some to express their displeasure.  Toronto comedian and actor Marilla Wex (who has appeared in shows like CBC's Working Moms) summarized her initial reactions to announcements of C.K.'s shows as ""outrage and disgust.""    ""The worst part about this is that it's incredibly retraumatizing for anybody who's suffered sexual abuse, especially the women in entertainment,"" Wex said ahead of Wednesday night's show. ""Because we're seeing somebody who has admitted what he did, has not really apologized, and is now touring comedy clubs. Great. So what message does it send? It doesn't matter, doesn't matter what he did.""  Other people took umbrage to the content of C.K.'s comeback shows. Specifically, leaked audio from C.K.'s performance in Levittown, N.Y., in Dec. 2018, seemed to suggest he was making fun of the teen survivors of the mass shooting in Parkland, Fla. Some of the parents of the students who died in that shooting were outraged.    Canadian-specific content  The comedian appears to have heeded at least some of that criticism, as the Parkland shooting jokes were notably absent from his first Toronto show, a move that got thumbs-up from Marc Winegust, who attended the performance.  ""Specifically people were hard on the Parkland shooting [bit], he's taken that one out and I think that actually does help settle it a little bit.""    But there was plenty of other material that could raise a few eyebrows. Early on in the show, he expounded on his status as a public pariah, joking the audience had not seen the worst of him yet as his extensive number of ""blackface photos"" had not yet been published (a joke clearly intended for his Canadian audiences only, given the recent controversy with Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau).  Still, to those who came to see Louis C.K. for his shocking breed of humour, the show didn't disappoint. Departing the stage, he got a standing ovation.",entertainment
527,Twitter removes Trump tweet of doctored Nickelback video aimed at Biden,"Twitter has removed a tweet from President Donald Trump that featured an edited Nickelback music video clip that took aim at former Vice President Joe Biden.  The post was removed because of a copyright complaint.  It had featured a doctored version of the Canadian band's 2005 music video Photograph, showing singer Chad Kroeger holding a photo of Biden, his son, an American business associate and another man.    Trump's tweet came as the president has repeatedly criticized Democrats for launching an impeachment inquiry into his telephone call with Ukraine's president in which Trump pressed for an investigation of his Democratic rival Biden and his son.  A Twitter spokeswoman said Thursday it responded ""to valid copyright complaints sent to us by a copyright owner or their authorized representatives.""

528,Sask. welder's Humboldt Broncos-inspired sculpture gets world attention,"In the middle of a cemetery near a small Saskatchewan city sits a sculpture of a girl sitting on a bench.  Her head is lowered, cupped in her hands. Like wings, branches stretch from her shoulders and droop down to the bench, nearly bare of any leaves.  From afar, the sculpture appears to have the ridges and bumps of bark, but the entire piece is made of metal welded by local artist Rob Jung.  ""I wanted to convey emotion in it. I wanted it to relay the sadness, the loss, but also hope, and love.""    The sculpture, Weeping Willow, was inspired by the Humboldt Broncos tragedy in April 2018.  Jung creates his works in an unconventional studio for an artist. A third-generation welder, he and his father do repair work and fabrication in an arc welding shop that his grandfather opened in Melfort in the 1950s.  While he has been a welder for roughly 20 years, Jung said, he didn't start venturing into artistic pieces until a few years ago when he was inspired by what he was seeing online.  ""The very first thing I saw was a full-sized metal, rusted person with a guitar, and I thought that was just the coolest thing.""  Jung realized after doing some small pieces that the metal sculptures take a lot of commitment, but it was something he wanted to stick with.    After the first few, Jung was asked to make a bench. Having seen metal pieces online of welded bark, Jung gave that a try.  That bench is now part of Weeping Willow, which sits in a meditation garden at Mount Pleasant Cemetery just outside the city.  Jung said he had the idea for the sculpture for some time. He was inspired by his friends, who had children who had passed away. After the Broncos bus crash in April 2018 that claimed the lives of 16 people and injured 13, Jung said he felt compelled to make the vision in his head a reality.      This motivation came at a time when Melfort Communities in Bloom was planning the meditation garden at the cemetery. After Jung described the piece to the group, he was commissioned to make it for the garden.    Jung said it came together just as he saw it in his mind. He based the measurements for the girl on the bench off of his daughter, who helped him on the piece along with his son.  ""I really liked that he thought to incorporate me in his work,"" said 17-year-old daughter Somer Jung. ""It touched me.""  Jung was able to show people the progress of the sculpture online, through a Facebook page and Instagram account.  ""It's unreal how it turned out and how many people followed,"" Jung said. ""I posted everything from start to finish, and [it] just got shared all over the world.""  The piece took 333 hours to complete. When Jung did an online post on it, people began messaging him about the significance of the number, which it's said is a sign from angels that you're on the right path.    The sculpture was installed last July in the meditation garden. That garden has since won a national award.  Jung said he has received messages from people who have been in the cemetery and have seen it themselves.  ""[They] tell me that they went out there and they cried. It just brought so much emotion to them, and that's the kind of art I like doing is something that has more than just something to look at — something that conveys emotion.""     Somer and her brother were about 13 when they first started welding with their father. Somer said she likes being able to see her dad doing something he loves.  ""I liked that he was able to share what he enjoys and that I was able to do that with him and he was willing to teach me.""  Jung seems to feel that as well, as he would like to be able to do art full time. The shop that has been in his family for three generations is now for sale as his father plans to retire, but his hope is to set up a small shop at his home and work from there.  ""It's very fulfilling. I have so many ideas in my head just non-stop. I have enough to last a lifetime, I think.""  ",entertainment
529,3 accused of providing drugs that killed rapper Mac Miller,"Three men arrested during the investigation into rapper Mac Miller's deadly overdose last year have now been charged with providing the drugs that killed him, U.S. prosecutors said Wednesday.  A grand jury indictment that was unsealed in Los Angeles accuses the men of conspiring and distributing cocaine and oxycodone pills laced with fentanyl that caused Miller's death in September 2018.  Cameron Pettit, Stephen Walter and Ryan Reavis were previously charged with drug-related offences. Wednesday's charges add the allegation that their drugs led to Miller's death.  The indictment alleged that Walter supplied the fentanyl and cocaine that Pettit sold to Miller and that Reavis, who lived in the Los Angeles area until earlier this year, acted as a middleman for the fentanyl sale.  Miller, 26, died of an accidental overdose of the powerful opioid fentanyl, along with cocaine and alcohol. Fentanyl has contributed to an epidemic of opioid abuse in North America that has claimed thousands of lives, including those of other musicians like Prince in 2016.    The men face a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years in federal prison and the potential for life without parole if convicted of either of the charges related to Miller's death.  All have been arrested in recent weeks and remain in custody, and none has entered a plea. Attorneys for Pettit and Walter declined comment. It's unclear whether Reavis has a lawyer    Pettit and Walter, who was also charged with being a felon in possession of ammunition, were scheduled to be arraigned on the new charges on Oct. 10. Reavis, who was arrested last week in Arizona, does not have an arraignment date set yet.  The indictment alleges the men continued to distribute drugs through August 2019.   Miller's beats and rhymes, with their frank expressions of drug use and depression, made him a beloved and respected figure among fans, including some of the biggest names in hip hop.  The Pittsburgh performer, whose real name was Malcolm James Myers McCormick, was in a two-year relationship with Ariana Grande that ended earlier in 2018. After his death, the pop star posted a loving video of him on her Instagram page and released Thank U, Next, a song that affectionately mentioned him.",entertainment
530,Placido Domingo resigns from LA Opera following harassment allegations,"Opera star Placido Domingo resigned Wednesday as general director of the Los Angeles Opera and withdrew from future performances at the company following multiple allegations of sexual harassment reported by The Associated Press.  ""I hold Los Angeles Opera very dearly to my heart and count my work to create and build it as among my most important legacies,"" said Domingo, 78, who helped found the company in the 1980s.  ""However, recent accusations that have been made against me in the press have created an atmosphere in which my ability to serve this company that I so love has been compromised,"" Domingo said in a statement.  He said he will continue to work to clear his name, but decided ""it is in the best interests of LA Opera for me to resign as general director and withdraw from my future scheduled performances at this time.""    The singer is widely credited with raising the profile of LA Opera, where he served as an artistic consultant from 1984 to 2000 and artistic director from 2000 to 2003. He has served as general director since 2003.  The resignation comes a week after the Metropolitan Opera's bombshell announcement that Domingo would not be taking the stage as the lead of Macbeth and possibly ever again.  Three other companies — the Philadelphia Orchestra, San Francisco Opera and Dallas Opera — had already removed Domingo from upcoming performances in the wake of AP stories that detailed multiple allegations of harassment and a variety of misconduct alleged by singers, a dancer and backstage opera employees over a period that spanned decades.  In two reports published Aug. 13 and Sept. 5 , the AP spoke to more than 20 women who accused Domingo of sexual harassment or other inappropriate, sexually charged conduct. Many said Domingo tried to pressure them into sexual relationships and sometimes punished them professionally if they rejected him. All said they feared reporting him because of his power to make or break their careers, and that his behaviour was an open secret in the opera world.    Domingo has denied any wrongdoing.  Domingo's departure from LA Opera raises questions about the future of his career in the United States, where he has been removed or has stepped down from all of his scheduled appearances for this year and next.    He still has a busy schedule of concerts across Europe, where the reaction to the allegations has been more muted.  The LA Opera Board of Directors thanked Domingo for his contributions to the art form in a separate statement Wednesday, which did not mention the allegations or an ongoing investigation into his alleged behaviour.  ""Placido Domingo's contributions to the cultural life of Los Angeles have been unprecedented and profound,"" the statement said.  ""We thank Placido for popularizing opera in the consciousness of Los Angeles and are deeply grateful for his inspiration and dedication to our institution and our community.""",entertainment
531,"Safety violations led to death of stunt driver on Deadpool 2 set, WorkSafeBC says","The filmmakers behind Deadpool 2 violated multiple workplace safety rules in the leadup to the death of a stunt driver in downtown Vancouver two years ago, investigators have found.  WorkSafeBC released results Wednesday of its investigation into the August 2017 death of 40-year-old Sequana Joi ""SJ"" Harris, who was thrown off her motorcycle and propelled through a plate glass window.  The investigation report says that TCF Vancouver Productions Ltd., a subsidiary of Twentieth Century Fox, failed to:     conduct a risk assessment addressing things like safety controls, speed and limitations of the motorcycle.   provide Harris with new worker orientation.   make sure Harris was wearing safety headgear   erect barriers to make sure Harris stayed within the set perimeter.   provide adequate supervision.      WorkSafeBC says the company violated three sections of the Workers Compensation Act and two sections of the Occupational Health and Safety Regulation.  The workplace safety body is now considering an administrative penalty against TCF, which handles Fox productions in B.C.    Harris was an experienced motorcycle racer, but had no prior experience as a stunt double before working on Deadpool 2.  At the time of her death, she was rehearsing a scene that involved driving a motorcycle out the open doors of the Vancouver Convention Centre. She lost control and failed to stop where she was supposed to, striking a median and then flying off the bike into the branches of a tree and through a window.    The report says no risk assessment was done to determine at what speed the motorcycle would become airborne as it travelled off the first ramp, nor to see if the addition of a second ramp would cause Harris to travel over the first ramp at a greater speed.  The Ducati motorcycle selected for use in the scene is designed to navigate on smooth surfaces and certain adjustments made to the bike meant it was a ""poor choice"" for use in situations where it may fly into the air, the report says.  In 2017, there were 103 serious injury claims in the arts and entertainment industry, as well as more than 600 time-loss claims, according to WorkSafeBC statistics.  'Safety is our top priority'  In a statement, a spokesperson for Twentieth Century Fox said: ""Safety is our top priority, and while we respectfully disagree with some of the report's findings, Fox thoroughly reviewed its stunt safety protocols immediately following the tragic accident and has revised and implemented enhanced safety procedures and enforcement.""  It did not elaborate on the findings it disagreed with in the WorkSafeBC report.  TCF could not be reached for comment. The report says TCF operates out of Mammoth Studios in Burnaby, B.C., but a woman who answered the phone at the studio said no one affiliated with TCF or the Deadpool 2  production remained on site.",entertainment
532,Juno Awards rejig Indigenous category to focus on artists instead of albums,"Juno Awards organizers are shaking up the Indigenous music category in hopes of putting a bigger spotlight on the artists.  After 25 years of awarding the albums produced by Indigenous creators, the Junos will now consider the broader work of Indigenous musicians within the qualifying year.  As such, what used to be presented as the Indigenous album of the year will be retitled as the Indigenous artist or group of the year award.  The changes will take effect at the Juno Awards in Saskatoon next March.  The Juno advisory committee for the Indigenous category says the decision was made in recognition of frequent questions they receive from Indigenous artists ""who believe they're submitting to a category meant to shine a spotlight on the accomplishments of Indigenous people.""  For artists to qualify, they must be Inuit, First Nations or Métis, while groups must have at least half of their members from those backgrounds, the organization said.      Our music is not niche. Our music is saying something.  - Jeremy Dutcher     The committee noted broader conversations have questioned the purpose of the Indigenous category at all.  ""We feel strongly that this change will eliminate a lot of the confusion and put us in a better position to explain the need for the category, when challenged,"" the organization said in a statement.  Category renamed numerous times  Since its introduction in 1994, the Indigenous category has undergone many changes.  Originally called the best music of Aboriginal Canada recording, it was renamed numerous times before the Junos settled on Aboriginal album of the year in 2010.  Two years ago, a committee of Juno organizers moved to rename the category Indigenous music album, in order to reflect the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples a year earlier.    But its foundation has been seen by some critics as a way to silo Indigenous artists into their own category.  Earlier this year, best Indigenous music album winner Jeremy Dutcher used his acceptance speech at a Junos industry gala to ask his fellow nominees to stand and be recognized.  ""All of your work changes this place, and it deserves to be considered outside of this category,"" he said.  ""Because our music is not niche. Our music is saying something.""",entertainment

534,Steve Martin to auction Lawren Harris mountain artwork ,"A painting by Lawren Harris will hit the Toronto auction block this fall after being consigned by a famous fan of the Group of Seven artist's work — comic legend Steve Martin.  The Heffel Fine Art Auction House says Harris' Mountain Sketch LXX could fetch between $300,000 and $500,000 at its sale next month.    The 1928 oil-on-board is one of several Harris works collected by Martin, who has helped raise the Canadian painter's international profile.  The American actor, comedian and musician donated a canvas by Harris to the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston in 2017.  Martin also co-curated a 2015-2016 exhibition Harris' northern landscapes that made stops in Los Angeles, Boston and Toronto.    Martin told The Canadian Press in 2016 that the artist's work was a hit with U.S. audiences.  ""Lawren Harris was virtually unknown in America — and now he's not. And the art lovers of America saw some of his finest work,"" Martin said in an interview at Toronto's Art Gallery of Ontario, which co-organized the exhibit alongside the Hammer Museum in L.A.  Martin said he first saw the artist's paintings in businessman and Harris collector Ken Thomson's Toronto storeroom, and was ""so taken with them.""    In recent years, Harris' works have attracted blockbuster bids, with Mountain Forms smashing Canadian art records in 2016 by selling for over $11.2 million.

535,Banksy canvas of chimps in U.K. Parliament up for auction amid Brexit uncertainty,"A massive Banksy canvas depicting chimpanzees in the U.K. Parliament could sell for a record sum at a London auction on Thursday, coinciding with a wild political time in British politics.  Sotheby's expects the painting could sell for up to £2 million ($3.3 million Cdn). The current record for an auctioned Banksy work was set in 2008 with the sale of Keep it Spotless for nearly $2.5 million Cdn.  The timing of the sale from a private collection is not coincidental as the U.K. approaches a new Brexit deadline at the end of the month and members of Parliament have been mired in unprecedented, bitter disputes about the future of the country.  Sotheby's Emma Baker, who is in charge of the auction featuring the work, told CBC News the current owner chose this timing.  ""To us, it couldn't have come at a better moment,"" she said, noting the political turmoil.  Watch Baker explain the fortuitous timing of the Banksy auction:    In promotional material, Sotheby's points out that the pre-auction exhibition is ""just a mile away from the Palace of Westminster,"" the setting for the painting and a place where opposition parties have come together in an effort to stop Prime Minister Boris Johnson from taking the nation out of the European Union without a divorce deal.  Evan Beard, head of art finance at Bank of America's private bank division, told CBC News in an email that London auction sales have suffered recently due to Brexit uncertainty.  ""The appearance of Banksy's withering view of Parliament feels more like a fist in the air by the auction house than the artist,"" he said.  Meanwhile, Banksy put out a rare post on Instagram saying  he has opened a shop in the London borough of Croydon.    The original work on canvas, which is about four metres wide, was created in 2009 with the name Question Time, but has since been reworked and retitled. Hanging lamps in the picture were snuffed out, creating a darker atmosphere. And an upturned banana held by one of the primates now points down. The painting was renamed Devolved Parliament this year.  Baker said Banksy reworked the canvas after its initial display in 2009. ""He wasn't completely happy with it. Whether that's for political reasons [or] whether that's just because it wasn't quite finished, that's for the artist to answer…. But it's completely 100 per cent the same painting.""    The elusive street artist Banksy has gained an international reputation for his sharp political commentary and dissident style, tackling topics including immigration and climate change. The artist has remained anonymous.  ""If metaphors could speak, this one by Banksy would tell us a lot about the antagonistic cacophony that characterizes contemporary British politics,"" Prof. Arshin Adib-Moghaddam from the politics department at London's School of Oriental and African Studies said in an email.  [PHOTOGALLERY]  The sale has garnered additional public attention following the surprise shredding of a Banksy artwork last year, which came just moments after the work sold at a Sotheby's auction in London. A shredder secretly implanted in the frame of the artwork destroyed half of the painting, leaving the slit-up art partially hanging outside the frame.  The Banksy stunt caught the art world by surprise and drew global coverage. The buyer decided to keep the work.     Banksy artwork self-destructs after selling for $1.4M    On his official Instagram account, Banksy indicated that he had intended to shred the entire work following the auction but the shredder malfunctioned.    The 2018 incident has left art lovers wondering if they should expect another stunt when the work goes under the hammer.  ""The cliffhanger is, of course, is this painting itself going to self-destruct on 31 October 2019?"" said Prof. Peter Osborne, director of the Centre for Research in Modern European Philosophy at Kingston University London.  Sotheby's says they've taken all necessary precautions.  ""We're not expecting anything to happen on Thursday night,"" said Sotheby's Baker.  ""We have totally taken as many precautions as possible …. We have taken the work out of its frame. We've X-rayed it. We've done everything, basically. We're not expecting anything to happen.

536,"Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, sues U.K. tabloid over publication of personal letter","Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, has sued a U.K. tabloid newspaper that she claims illegally published a personal letter she wrote to her father.  The civil lawsuit accuses the Mail on Sunday of copyright infringement, misuse of private information and violating the U.K's data protection law with the ""intrusive"" publication of the letter, a spokesperson for Schillings, the law firm handling the case, said.  Prince Harry accused the Mail on Sunday of editing the letter in ""an intentionally destructive manner"" to ""manipulate"" readers with an unflattering portrayal of his wife, who was the American actress known as Meghan Markle before the couple married in May 2018.  In a long statement lambasting British tabloids more broadly, Harry said the lawsuit had ""been many months in the making"" following a ""ruthless campaign"" to smear Meghan by a ""press pack that has vilified her almost daily"" and created ""lie after lie at her expense"" during her maternity leave.  ""I have been a silent witness to her private suffering for too long. To stand back and do nothing would be contrary to everything we believe in,"" the prince said in the statement posted on the couple's royal website.    ""There is a human cost to this relentless propaganda, specifically when it is knowingly false and malicious, and though we have continued to put on a brave face — as so many of you can relate to — I cannot begin to describe how painful it has been,"" Harry said.  A Mail on Sunday spokesperson told Britain's Press Association the paper ""stands by the story it published and will be defending this case vigorously.  ""Specifically, we categorically deny that the duchess's letter was edited in any way that changed its meaning.""   Harry has criticized British celebrity news coverage before. He lashed out at aggressive paparazzi that stalked Meghan's every move when they were dating and offensive treatment of her biracial heritage by some media.  In Tuesday's statement, he mentioned his late mother, Princess Diana, who died in an August 1997 car crash while being pursued by paparazzi, as the reason he knew the move to take a tabloid to court ""may not be the safe one, it is the right one.  ""Because my deepest fear is history repeating itself,"" he said. ""I've seen what happens when someone I love is commoditized to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person.    Meghan and Harry are paying for the lawsuit with private and not public funds, the Press Association reported. The news agency said if damages are awarded to Meghan, they will be donated to a charity that combats bullying.  The lawsuit also names the Mail on Sunday's parent company, Associated Newspapers.  Harry said the couple and their baby son, Archie, have received positive news coverage during their royal tour in southern Africa that demonstrated how Meghan has been subjected to press ""bullying"" back home.

Still, it took Wells — the founder and publisher at Windsor, Ont.-based publishing house Biblioasis — six months to acquire Ellmann's 2019 Booker Prize-nominated novel Ducks, Newburyport.  ""Every American, multinational and most of the best independents read it and turned it down,"" he said. ""So we got it mainly due to what Lucy called our 'charming persistence,' and … since then, we've just kind of driven that home.""  Biblioasis has been working on Ducks, Newburyport since January 2019 and the book was officially released on Sept. 10, 2019.   In that time, the novel has received rave reviews, including glowing write-ups from the New York Times, the Guardian and the New Yorker.   ""There's been a range of other coverage, so it's become a sensation within the literary community in a way that has not happened in our 15 years as a publisher,"" he said.   At the same time, acclaim for the novel — including its place on the 2019 Booker Prize shortlist — has also benefited Biblioasis.    ""There's a practical benefit of sales, which will help us a great deal — and the attention it brings,"" Wells said. ""But I also take a great deal of comfort and confidence from the fact that we have always just done what we're going to do.""  According to Wells, the attention received by Ducks, Newburyport will also provide greater exposure for Biblioasis — a publishing house that otherwise can't compete with larger companies like McClelland &amp; Stewart, Random House and Bertelsmann.  ""We are certainly going to be better known as a result of this,"" said Wells. ""We can now point to Ducks, Newburyport and the coverage we've been able to get when talking to foreign agents who might otherwise be reticent.""  Of course, a Booker Prize nomination isn't the only impressive news this year for Biblioasis.     Two other books — K.D. Miller's Late Breaking and Adam Foulds's Dream Sequence — both landed on the 2019 Giller Prize long list.  And for Wells, more books under the Biblioasis umbrella means more opportunities for readers to connect with literature.  ""My job as a publisher is to ride the wave as much as I can, when something like the Booker Prize happens,"" Wells said.   ""I'm thrilled for Lucy [Ellmann] and this book, but we have other books as well that we care about equally … the hardest challenge here is to ensure that they all find the audiences they deserve.""",entertainment

Bieber shared some photos via social media early Tuesday morning.    Representatives of the pair did not return requests for comment on Monday, but celebrity media and paparazzi have been closely following the two days of celebrations at the Montage Palmetto Bluff resort.

540,New documentary profiles renowned Haida artist Robert Davidson,"Anyone who has visited or lives on Canada's West Coast has likely come across Haida art; it's often found in gift and souvenir shops, on the ferry between Vancouver and Vancouver Island, and at festivals up and down the coast.   Seeing Indigenous art was not always so easy, and documentary filmmaker Charles Wilkinson endeavoured to find out why in his latest film Haida Modern.   The film chronicles Haida artist Robert Davidson's life, and looks at the impact Davidson and his work have had on the country.   ""His work is so beautiful and it's so evocative,"" Wilkinson told North by Northwest host Sheryl MacKay.   ""It's like we're inviting the world to come to a gallery and see this phenomenal exhibition of Robert's work.""    1969 totem pole raising  Davidson, who also spoke to MacKay, said one of the more notable moments in his life was in 1969, when he carved a new totem pole for Haida Gwaii. It was the first time in decades that a pole had been raised there.  Davidson said it sparked a reawakening of Haida culture, after years of oppression, including the potlatch ban and residential schools.     Davidson was 22 when the totem pole went up.   ""The inspiration came from my elders,"" Davidson said.  The pole was — and continues to be — celebrated by many, but at the time of its creation not everyone was on board with the idea.    ""There was so much pain, culturally, and also with our language,"" Davidson said.   His parents' generation had been to residential school, and weren't allowed to speak their own language. When they returned home, they were strangers to their communities.   Because of this, he says, one elder was adamant that he not carve the pole. His grandparents, however, encouraged him to create it.     Wilkinson is proud of the moment in the film when Davidson speaks about the meaning of ceremonies, and why non-Indigenous people are so attracted to these types of celebrations.   ""He said it's because the spiritualism is so genuine, it's so legitimate,"" Wilkinson said, noting the film includes footage of Davidson dancing and wearing a traditional mask.  ""I just get chills,"" he said. ""It's a really genuine experience.""  Haida Modern will screen at the Vancouver International Film Festival on October 1 and 11.",entertainment
541,Opera legend Jessye Norman dies at 74,"Jessye Norman, the renowned international opera star whose passionate soprano voice won her four Grammy Awards, the National Medal of Arts and the Kennedy Center Honor, has died, according to family spokesperson Gwendolyn Quinn. She was 74.  A statement released to The Associated Press on Monday said Norman died at 7:54 a.m. ET from septic shock and multi-organ failure resulting from complications of a spinal cord injury she suffered in 2015. She died at Mount Sinai St. Luke's Hospital in New York, and was surrounded by loved ones.  ""We are so proud of Jessye's musical achievements and the inspiration that she provided to audiences around the world that will continue to be a source of joy,"" the family statement read. ""We are equally proud of her humanitarian endeavors addressing matters such as hunger, homelessness, youth development, and arts and culture education.""  Funeral arrangements will be announced in the coming days.  Norman was a trailblazing performer, and one of the rare black singers to attain worldwide stardom in the opera world, performing at such revered houses as La Scala and the Metropolitan Opera, and singing title roles in works like Carmen, Aida and more. She sang the works of Richard Wagner, but was not limited to opera or classical music, performing songs by Duke Ellington and others as well.      Pigeonholing is only interesting to pigeons.​​​​  - Jessye Norman, opera singer     ""I have always been drawn to things other people might consider unusual. I'm always taken by the text and beautiful melody. It's not important to me who has written it. It's just more reasonable to have an open mind about what beauty is,"" Norman said in a 2002 interview with the Chicago Sun-Times.  ""It's important for classical musicians to stretch and think beyond the three B's [Bach, Beethoven and Brahms]. They were wonderful composers, but they went to the great beyond a long time ago. There's lots of music that will live for a very long time.""  In that same interview, she profoundly said, ""Pigeonholing is only interesting to pigeons.""  Norman certainly knew no boundaries or limits. She broke barriers and had hoped her industry would see more faces like hers.  ""It is a more diverse place, thank goodness,"" Norman said of the opera world in a 2004 interview with NPR. ""I wish it were even more diverse than it is.""  Norman was born on Sept. 15, 1945 in Augusta, Ga., in segregationist times. She grew up singing in church and around a musical family that included pianists and singers. She earned a scholarship to the historically black college Howard University in Washington, D.C., to study music, and later studied at the Peabody Conservatory and the University of Michigan.  Eventually she made her operatic debut in 1969 in Berlin, wowing audiences around the world on stages in Milan, London and New York thanks to her shining vocals, no matter the language. The New York Times described her voice as ""a grand mansion of sound.""    The Met Opera called Norman ""one of the great sopranos of the past half-century"" in a statement.  ""Starting with her Met debut as Cassandra in Berlioz's Les Troyens on Opening Night of the Met's centennial 1983-84 season, Norman sang more than 80 performances with the company, dazzling audiences with her beautiful tone, extraordinary power, and musical sensitivity,"" the statement read.  Former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams describe Norman as ""a woman of vision, adventure and joy,"" whose ""legacy lives on in music and the children who greet art in her name each day.""  Broadway legend Audra McDonald wrote on Twitter, ""UGH! Nooooooo! This is awful. I was literally supposed to spend time with her next week. RIP most magnificent amazing brilliant Diva.""    In 1997, at age 52, Norman became the youngest person ever to earn the Kennedy Center Honor in the organization's 20-year history, at the time. She received her National Medal of Arts from former president Barack Obama and has earned honorary doctorates from a number of prestigious schools, including Juilliard, Harvard and Yale. She is a member of British Royal Academy of Music and Georgia Music Hall of Fame. An orchid was even named after her in France, and the country also made her a Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters.  Norman earned 15 Grammy nominations throughout her illustrious career, picking up her first at the 1985 show for best classical vocal soloist performance for Ravel: Songs Of Maurice Ravel. She earned the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2006.  Norman also gave back, raising funds to help students attend school, championing the arts in schools and championing diversity.    ""I look at symphony orchestras around this country and I want those orchestras to look more like the demographic they're meant to serve. I would like to see more African-Americans on the stage at the Metropolitan Opera here in New York.  ""There are certainly some, but not nearly enough, and I come across so many singers who are terribly gifted and that would be an asset to these opera companies around our country. But we still have these people who are just a little bit hesitant, and perhaps not as openhearted ... as I'd like them to be,"" she said.  ""I look forward to the day when we do not think about colour of skin when we're looking to have a person do a job, whatever that job is.""  The Jessye Norman School of the Arts opened in 2003 in Augusta to provide a free fine arts education to disadvantaged children. The Augusta Chronicle reported that Norman was set to attend the Oct. 11 street-naming ceremony in her hometown on Eighth Street, where the school is located. It will be named Jessye Norman Boulevard.  In 1990, Augusta opened the Jessye Norman Amphitheater to honour the opera icon.  Norman released her memoir Stand Up Straight and Sing! in 2004.  She is survived by two remaining siblings, James Norman and Elaine Sturkey.",entertainment

""We felt great about all the choices that we made. They were all very strong books. Even the long list was exceptionally strong, so we had to come to some decisions,"" added literary critic and fellow juror Donna Bailey Nurse.
