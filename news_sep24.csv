83,Michigan warns about mosquito-borne virus after 3 deaths,"Public health officials are urging people to guard against mosquito bites after more cases of a rare mosquito-borne virus, including two additional deaths in southwestern Michigan.  The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services issued an update Tuesday on Eastern equine encephalitis, saying there were deaths in Cass and Van Buren counties. Those follow an earlier death in Kalamazoo County.    There also have been human cases in Barry and Berrien counties, and animal cases in St. Joseph, Genesee and Lapeer counties. In all, Michigan has had seven confirmed human cases and nine horse deaths.  The department is encouraging officials in affected counties to consider postponing, rescheduling or cancelling outdoor activities occurring at or after dusk, particularly activities that involve children, until there's a hard frost.   The virus is rare but dangerous, and symptoms include fever, chills and muscle and joint pain. It can cause inflammation and swelling in the brain.   According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 30 per cent of people infected with the virus die.   At least 20 cases have been reported in five states.",health
20,"Liberals pledge to boost Canada Child Benefit, extend leave for adoptive parents","The Liberals are promising a suite of family-friendly benefits, including a boost to the Canada Child Benefit (CCB) for babies and a 15-week leave program for adoptive parents.  Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau used a Tuesday morning campaign appearance in St. John's to announce the proposed measures, which include making parental benefits tax-free.  Calling it a ""big step forward,"" Trudeau pledged that a re-elected Liberal government would give families up to $1,000 more by increasing the CCB by 15 per cent for children under the age of one. The CCB was introduced in 2016 and the Liberals have credited it with lifting 300,000 children out of poverty.  ""No one should have to choose between their paycheque and their family, a choice that moms are still confronted with more than dads,"" Trudeau said. ""People should be focused on spending time with their baby, not worried about how they'll pay their bills.""    The Liberal proposal to make maternity and parental benefits tax-exempt at source means no federal taxes would be taken off the Employment Insurance payment, Trudeau said. It goes one step further than the Conservative Party proposal to bring in a non-refundable tax credit for maternity or parental benefits.   ""You'll get every dollar right when you need it, since no taxes will be taken off the EI cheque when new parents receive it,"" Trudeau said.    The proposed new 15-week leave for adoptive parents would give them the same benefits as those who have a baby through natural birth. That would mean an extra $7,000 in help for the average family claiming the new adoptive leave, according to the Liberal Party documents.  Trudeau said these measures lay the groundwork to ""go even further.""  A re-elected Liberal government also would work with the provinces and territories to establish Guaranteed Paid Family Leave for parents who don't qualify for paid leave through EI during the first year of their child's life. The party's proposal calls for the program to launch in 2021.  'Ambitious program'  ""This will be an ambitious program to make sure that no one gets left behind,"" Trudeau said.  Lindsay Tedds, an economics professor at the University of Calgary, said she's awaiting finer details on how the tax measures would be implemented in order to fully assess both proposals. She said one advantage of the Liberal plan over the Conservative one is that claimants won't have to worry about the tax liability.  ""A lot of women who work earn a lot of income before they go on maternity benefits, and they actually pay a higher tax rate on that income than 15 per cent,"" she said. ""So the Conservatives haven't accounted for that, whereas the Liberals are accounting for that ... The Liberals can actually tout this as tax-free maternity and parental benefits. The Conservatives can't.""  According to Liberal Party calculations, the proposed measures would cost about $800 million in 2020-21, rising to $1.2 billion in 2023-24. Costing analysis from the parliamentary budget officer (PBO) has not yet been released.  Asked why none of the Liberal campaign commitments so far have come with PBO costing, Trudeau said the PBO has been ""very much engaged"" with the Liberal Party on its platform.  ""We will have a full costing of the Liberal platform with all the great work done by the PBO in due course. That is something people expect and people want to have,"" he said.",business
27,Hundreds join student's climate-change pledge: No kids until Canada takes action,"An 18-year-old McGill University student pledges to not have children until she is sure the Canadian government is taking serious steps to battle climate change.  And hundreds more are following in her footsteps.  ""Our government isn't doing enough,"" Emma Lim said on CBC Montreal's Daybreak Tuesday.  The steps provincial and federal lawmakers are taking are ""nowhere near the action needed,"" she said.  The young climate activist decided to take action of her own — launching a climate-change movement dubbed, ""#No Future, No Children,"" that is quickly gathering steam.   Her campaign, which invites all Canadians to participate, officially kicked off Monday on Parliament Hill.   As of Tuesday morning, more than 300 people have signed her online pledge, which states: ""I pledge to not have children until I am sure my government will ensure a safe future for them.""  Having kids is something Lim has always thought was in her future, but she wants a future where, every fall, she can watch the leaves change colour.  She wants to go sledding with her kids in the winter and swimming in the ocean in the summer.  ""I am giving up my chance of having a family because I will only have children if I know I can keep them safe,"" she writes on her website.   ""It breaks my heart, but I created this pledge because I know I am not alone.""    She wants her children to breathe clean air and live a life in economic security — not the possible insecurity wrought by climate change, she said.  Lim said she comes from a family of Holocaust survivors who have experienced first-hand the impact mass migration can have on people's lives.  Mass migration caused by a global climate crisis could be many times what her family experienced and just the idea that her children may have to ""again face the very worst of humanity terrifies me,"" she said.    Dreams of motherhood  Lim grew up in London, Ont., and she has wanted to be a mom for as long as she can remember. She still has a list of baby names on her computer, she said.  Listen to Emma Lim's interview on Daybreak here:   Giving up that dream is not easy, she said, and she worries that, despite her best efforts, nothing will change.  The patriotism she felt as a child — the belief that her government can do anything — is fading, she said.  ""It's clear that our leaders aren't taking this seriously and this is a serious issue,"" she said, citing the federal government's approval of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion on the heels of proclaiming a climate crisis.    As it is, Canada is not on track to meeting the Paris Agreement goals, she said. Were the country to take the necessary steps to meet those goals, she said she may one day consider having kids, but everyone who pledges has a different objective.  Her aim is to look to the future with hope instead of fear, she said.    Waiting until the government takes action before having kids is an ""alien concept"" for her parents and grandparents, Lim said, but she's getting support back home.  Mother supports daughter  Lim's mother, Catherine Cartman, went to Ottawa to support her daughter.  ""It's a parent's role to support their children,"" she said, and she hopes it will inspire change.     Cartman, a mother of three, said she wants Lim and ""youth everywhere to feel safe to have children.""  While she would like Lim to have children someday, she said, were the world to fall into complete disarray because of a climate crisis, ""who can blame her for not having children? ""  ""It would be selfish on my part to encourage her to have children under those circumstances.""",technology
96,"Purdue Pharma, maker of OxyContin, files for bankruptcy as part of settlement ","Purdue Pharma, the company that made billions selling the prescription painkiller OxyContin, filed for bankruptcy in White Plains, N.Y., days after reaching a tentative settlement with many of the state and local governments suing it over the toll of opioids.  The filing was anticipated before and after the tentative deal, which could be worth up to $12 billion US over time, was struck.  ""This settlement framework avoids wasting hundreds of millions of dollars and years on protracted litigation,"" Steve Miller, chairman of Purdue's board of directors, said in a statement, ""and instead will provide billions of dollars and critical resources to communities across the country trying to cope with the opioid crisis. We will continue to work with state attorneys general and other plaintiff representatives to finalize and implement this agreement as quickly as possible.""  But legal battles still lie ahead for Stamford, Conn.-based Purdue, which is spending millions on legal costs as it defends itself in lawsuits from 2,600 government and other entities. About half the states have not signed onto the proposal. And several of them plan to object to the settlement in bankruptcy court and to continue litigation in other courts against members of the Sackler family, which owns the company. The family agreed to pay at least $3 billion in the settlement plus contribute the company itself, which is to be reformed with its future profits going to the company's creditors.  In a statement, the families of late company owners Mortimer and Raymond Sackler said they have ""deep compassion for the victims of the opioid crisis"" and believe the settlement framework ""is an historic step toward providing critical resources that address a tragic public health situation.""    Objections came over the amount of the deal, which some officials say will not reach close to the $12 billion mark, and because it means the company won't be found liable by a jury or judge.  Purdue chairman Miller said the company has not admitted wrongdoing and does not intend to. ""The alternative is to not settle but instead to resume the litigation,"" he said on a conference call with reporters. ""The resumption of litigation would rapidly diminish all the resources of the company and would be lose-lose-lose all the way around. Whatever people might wish for is not on the table now.""  Because so many states balked at the settlement, it could complicate the bankruptcy process. The Sackler family members said they're still trying to get more states to sign on.  ""We are hopeful that in time, those parties who are not yet supportive will ultimately shift their focus to the critical resources that the settlement provides to people and problems that need them,"" they said.    Key issues that could be decided include whether the suits against the Sacklers in state courts will be able to move ahead, and what will happen to the company itself. Under the tentative settlement deal, it would continue to operate, but with profits used to pay for the settlement. Another option could be for a judge to order it be sold.  Court filings assert that members of the Sackler family were paid more than $4 billion by Purdue from 2007 to 2018. Much of the family's fortune is believed to be held outside the U.S., which could complicate lawsuits against the family over opioids.  A court filing by the New York Attorney General's office on Friday contended that Sackler family members used Swiss and other hidden accounts to transfer $1 billion to themselves. The discovery of the transfers bolsters several states' claims that family members worked to shield its wealth because of the growing legal threats against them and Purdue.  The Sacklers have given money to cultural institutions around the world, including the Smithsonian Institution, New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art and London's Tate Modern.",health
91,'Not one shred of scientific evidence': Critics say psych reports in custody cases can hurt kids,"When a Vancouver-area mother read a psychologist's recommendations for custody of her young daughter, she started hyperventilating at work.  Dr. Allan Posthuma was recommending the courts grant sole guardianship to her ex, a man with a previous conviction for domestic violence who'd had multiple run-ins with police.  ""I was frantic. I was scared that they were going to take her away. I was thinking about all the things that would have happened to her,"" the mother remembered in a recent interview. CBC is not naming her to protect the privacy of her daughter.  Investigators with the College of Psychologists of B.C. allege that Posthuma failed to properly consider documented issues with violence when he evaluated the family.   The allegation hasn't been proven, but some critics say this isn't an isolated problem. They argue that the court-ordered psychological assessments used in family legal disputes across North America are inherently flawed and can cause serious harm for children and families.    ""To the best of my knowledge, there is not one shred of scientific evidence that child custody evaluations benefit children, and most unfortunately there have been cases where the psychologists' recommendations to the court endorsed parents who later killed their own children,"" Florida psychologist Dr. Ira Turkat told CBC.  He made it clear that he could not comment on Posthuma's case, but Turkat has been arguing against the use of these evaluations for more than a decade. He outlined his case last year in a piece published in the American Journal of Family Law, pointing out instances in Virginia, Maryland and California where parents have killed their children after courts granted custody or visitation rights in response to psychologists' recommendations.  Child homicides are at the extreme end of potential consequences for a misguided psychological assessment, but critics in B.C. remain deeply concerned about the potential damages.  Family violence not fully addressed  Under the Family Law Act, these custody and access reports are known as Section 211 assessments. They're ordered by judges to help make decisions in contentious family disputes, and can be performed by independent psychologists like Posthuma or family justice counsellors employed by the province.  These assessments are currently under the microscope as part of a federal government-funded research project examining the legal system's response to family violence, according to Haley Hrymak, a research lawyer with Rise Women's Legal Centre.  She told CBC that many psychologists and counsellors don't fully consider the issue of domestic violence when they're making their recommendations. Sometimes, they don't ask any questions about whether anyone in the family has been violent, she said.    ""Obviously, the presence of family violence has a major impact on the best interests of the children, but our research suggests that it is not always being captured or addressed,"" Hrymak said.  Researchers from Rise and the Centre for Response-Based Practice have been poring over Section 211 reports and interviewing women who've been assessed.  Many of the women report that the psychologists and counsellors they've dealt with have been dismissive of their concerns about an ex-partner, even concluding they are not fit to have custody of their children.    ""These women are frequently sitting down with the report writer and they have genuine fears and concerns about their violent ex-spouse,"" Hrymak said.  ""But instead, the woman may be described as paranoid because of a multiple-choice questionnaire they filled out on a computer.""  The research has also raised concerns about the cost of Section 211 assessments, which can be as high as $20,000 or $30,000, Hrymak said. That total doesn't include the expense of undergoing any counselling or follow-up assessments recommended by a psychologist.    ""I've spoken with women who have spent over $100,000 simply on this piece of their litigation, and ultimately are in a financial crisis as a result of that,"" Hrymak said.  She wants to see changes in legislation to make sure discussions of family violence are included in all Section 211 reports, and and to require psychologists to complete training on the subject.  'Custody evaluations may be helpful'  These psychological assessments do have strong defenders.  Dr. Allan Posthuma is one, and he wrote a counterpoint to Turkat's arguments in a 2016 article in the publication Court Review.  Posthuma and his co-author Jonathan Gould agreed that more research is needed on the impact of psychological assessments on families, but said that doesn't necessarily mean they're harmful.    ""Since there is no empirical examination of the short- and long-term effects of expert opinions regarding custodial placement and decision making on judicial determinations, it is just as easy to argue that custody evaluations may be helpful,"" they wrote.  Posthuma's lawyer, Michael Schalke, told CBC that his client is satisfied with his record. He did not respond to a request for comment about suggestions that Section 211 assessments can be harmful.",health
108,Attack on Saudi oil facilities highlights danger of 'kamikaze' drones,"The recent attack on Saudi oil facilities has cast a spotlight on an increasingly used but often misunderstood piece of combat technology: ""kamikaze"" or ""suicide"" drones.  And the incident has brought into focus what one expert calls the ""eminent"" possibility of such devices one day being used to sow terror in major cities.  The strikes on the Saudi Aramco plants last Saturday involved some 20 drones and several cruise missiles, U.S. officials have reportedly said. Although drone attacks have been carried out before in the region, this effort significantly disrupted Saudi Arabia's oil capacity, marking an escalation in their scale of destruction.  Houthi rebels — aligned with Iran and battling the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen's civil war — quickly took responsibility for the strikes. U.S. officials blamed Iran, but Tehran rejected the claim.   On Wednesday, a Saudi defence ministry spokesperson identified the drones as Iranian delta-wing unmanned aerial vehicles, and presented at a news conference remnants of drones and missiles. But an adviser to Iran's president said the news conference ""proved that Saudi Arabia knows nothing about where the missiles and drones were made or launched from.""  While it's not entirely clear who's responsible, it is known that since 2018, the Houthis have obtained advanced drones capable of attacks beyond Yemen's borders, according to a UN Security Council report released last January.     Device 'shrouded in mystery'  Identifying the devices as UAV-X (unmanned aerial vehicle X), the report said they could fly 1,500 kilometres and travel at speeds of up to 250 kmu002Fh.  What's more, the device can carry a warhead made up of 18 kilograms of explosives and ball bearings, making it potentially more lethal than other Houthi-owned drones, the UN report warned.  Known broadly in the industry as ""loitering munitions"" for their common ability to stop mid-air and wait for a target, the category of devices is also referred to as kamikaze or suicide drones. They're normally destroyed themselves while mounting an attack.    As for the UAV-X, it can also be used in reconnaissance missions to gather intelligence at a distance. Among the debris of one such device, the UN's panel of experts found the lens from a Nikon D810, a widely-available, professional-grade digital camera.  Beyond that, the device is ""somewhat shrouded in mystery,"" said Arthur Holland Michel, co-director of the Center for the Study of the Drone at Bard College.    Despite the secrecy around the UAV-X, Holland Michel said, ""I wouldn't be surprised if something like the loitering munitions used by the Houthis did become somewhat widely accessible in three to five years.""  Military-grade drones, especially those deployed by the United States, have been best known for use in surveillance operations and targeted killings from thousands of kilometres away.  They bear almost no resemblance to the off-the-shelf devices available at stores. Instead, the UAV-X is shaped more like a jet with a wingspan of 4.5 metres — roughly the length of a sedan.  Hard to detect  Air defence systems often aren't calibrated to detect loitering munitions, which fly at lower altitudes and speeds than ballistic missiles and military aircraft. The result is the drones may only be spotted from a shorter distance, according to Justin Bronk, a research fellow at London's Royal United Services Institute (RUSI).  Bronk said anti-drone systems generally involve guns shooting down the devices. The systems aren't ideal; they run out of ammunition and can easily be overwhelmed by multiple incoming targets at once.    ""There is no perfect answer,"" he said.  Much of the damage caused in last weekend's attack may be due to the use of missiles, rather than drones. Loitering munitions still can't handle the same size of weaponry as larger missiles.  But the number of devices deployed appears to underscore the difficulty in defending against such a co-ordinated operation.   ""The co-ordination of those [drones] would not be entirely simple,"" said Craig Martin, a professor at the Washburn University School of Law. But compared to other weapon systems, ""they're relatively cheap.""  Martin wrote an essay about Canada's planned acquisition of armed drones. (The Royal Canadian Air Force hopes to purchase armed drones for domestic and overseas use within six years, The Canadian Press reported in February.)    In a telephone interview, Martin estimated the drone attack in Saudi Arabia would have cost ""tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars."" He said that's much less than Riyadh's $1 million US or more spent to deploy a single Patriot surface-to-air missile as a means of defending against Houthi threats.  RUSI's Bronk said, ""The price of entry"" isn't very high. And ""it does potentially give small groups or countries long range, fairly accurate, precision strike capabilities.""  He said the use of loitering munitions isn't new, but their prices have dropped and freely-available GPS data has made them easier to program for use on a specific target. A quick search on Google Maps, for instance, reveals the exact location of Saudi oil facilities.  The drones deployed last Saturday are believed to have been GPS-programmed to hit those exact spots.    'Threat' from consumer-grade drones  Off-the-shelf drones aren't made to carry weapons, but videos shared online appear to show ISIS using such commercial devices to drop grenades in Iraq and Syria.  Speaking to a U.S. Senate panel last year, FBI Director Christopher Wray called the use of civilian drones by criminal groups ""a steadily escalating threat.""  Holland Michel, at the Center for the Study of the Drone, said an attack in a big city involving grenades strapped to drones ""is eminently possible today."" Citing the example of an armed drone flying over a crowded stadium, he called the potential ""very worrying.""    Many countries and major cities, however, have adopted a patchwork of laws banning drones from public areas. And Holland Michel said if a criminal group were to acquire the weapons needed for such an attack, it would raise a red flag among security services.  ""We don't want people thinking this kind of Houthi drone attack is possible tomorrow in Toronto.""",technology
98,"Incredibly rare, centuries-old book on insects returns to Newfoundland","It hasn't been seen in Newfoundland since 1835.  Full of exquisite illustrations by a visiting amateur naturalist, Entomologia Terrae Novae was Phillip Henry Gosse's attempt to chronicle the insect life of Newfoundland.   ""He came from England to Carbonear when he was 17. He came here to be a clerk and while he was here, he created this beautiful book,"" said Elizabeth Smith, acquisitions and cataloging officer with the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa.  The book is the first known attempt to classify bug life in the province, and was flown into St. John's for public viewing this week from its usual spot in Ottawa. Featuring more than 250 paintings, the piece is on display at the Centre for Newfoundland Studies.  The rare object cannot be touched by the public, and special gloves have to be  worn to handle it; it was a stressful ordeal for Smith to even transport it to Newfoundland on an airplane.     Gosse wasn't a formally trained illustrator, but his artwork is impressive nonetheless.  ""His father was a miniature portrait artist, based on the research I did about him. It was his aunt who was responsible for teaching him how to draw,"" said Smith.      When you look at it live with your own eyes… it looks real.  - Elizabeth Smith     ""When you look at it live with your own eyes … it looks real, it's in 3D. The texture, the butterflies look velvety. And it's absolutely exquisite,"" said Smith.  The dates assigned to the drawings vary throughout the book, revealing that Gosse was simply jotting down pictures of fauna as he came across them during his stay. Carrying the journal with him as he travelled, he would document whichever creature caught his eye.    Like a hiker visiting Newfoundland today, Gosse was simply marvelling at the nature he encountered and attempting to memorialize it, just as a tourist would use a cellphone to take pictures during a trip.  Gosse didn't stick around Newfoundland forever, though. When he left, his work did as well.    ""I think from what we know the book went on and was kept with family for a while until it was passed along from Philip Henry Gosse to his son Edmund Gosse, and Edmund Gosse passed it along to his son Philip. And from there it it remained in the family for a while until it was donated to the museum in the 1950s,"" Smith told CBC Radio's On the Go.  Gosse's work didn't end with his trip to the Rock.  ""He moves on to Quebec and Alabama … and he moves on to explore other life forms — in fact, some of which he was more famous for. It is said that he invented the word 'aquarium,'"" said Smith.  ""Interestingly, in this book the very last page is a sketch of dolphins.… It almost teases you into the next chapter of his of his profession, of his life.""  You can see that dolphin illustration for yourself Friday at the Centre for Newfoundland Studies in Memorial University.  You aren't allowed to touch it, though.

143,Untested legal options could give feds ways to intervene on Bill 21,"National party leaders' reluctance to intervene in a court challenge to Quebec's controversial Bill 21 may have left the erroneous impression that there's nothing the federal government can do to try to stop the law that bans teachers, police and certain other public servants from wearing religious symbols at work.  The Quebec government has, after all, invoked the Constitution's notwithstanding clause to prevent its secularism law from being struck down as a violation of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  But while use of the notwithstanding clause makes a court challenge more difficult, constitutional experts say it does not necessarily provide a blanket shield against charter challenges, nor does it prevent the federal government from pursuing other legal avenues.    ""There are legal bases for challenging the law that are not touched by the notwithstanding clause at all,"" says Robert Leckey, dean of law at McGill University.  Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau is the only national leader to leave the door open to a possible intervention by the federal government some day, although he says it would be ""counterproductive"" to do so now when a challenge by two civil rights groups is before Quebec's Superior Court.  Other than Trudeau, federal leaders seem happy to heed Quebec Premier Francois Legault's admonition to butt out.  All about jurisdiction  The Conservatives' Andrew Scheer, the NDP's Jagmeet Singh and the Greens' Elizabeth May have said they would not intervene to challenge the law, which they've nevertheless deplored. People's Party Leader Maxime Bernier has chided his fellow federal leaders for even talking about something he deems to be entirely Quebec's business.  All the tip-toeing around Bill 21 is no doubt primarily a reflection of the fact that Bill 21 is overwhelmingly popular in Quebec, a province that will be pivotal to the outcome of the Oct. 21 federal election.  But it may also reflect the fact that the legal options available after Quebec's use of the notwithstanding clause are untested. As the only federal leader who hasn't slammed the door on intervening, Trudeau may want to see how some of the arguments fare in court before deciding whether to take the plunge.  ""Unless you can persuade courts to breach new legal ground, there really isn't an obvious resolution,"" says University of Ottawa law professor Carissima Mathen.  ""There are some new arguments that have been raised by some scholars but it would be unprecedented so the court would have to be persuaded. I think people agree it would be an uphill climb.""    Still, Leckey says the courts have in the past found creative ways to address laws that judges have deemed ""deeply unjust.""  ""I think we'll see people trying arguments that have not been used because they've not been needed before,"" he adds.  Section 33 of the charter provides that a legislature may declare that a law will operate notwithstanding certain rights and freedoms otherwise guaranteed in the Charter of Rights.  One argument now being advanced is based on the fact that the clause applies only to some sections of the charter. Important ones, sections that cover fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of religion, legal rights and equality rights, but not the entire thing.  The notwithstanding clause cannot be used to shield a law from other provisions of the charter, such as Section 28, which specifies that the rights and freedoms referred to in the charter are ""guaranteed equally to male and female persons.""  Varying opinions on charter sections  Because the secularism law affects Muslim women disproportionately, forbidding practically any distinctive clothing such as hijabs, Leckey says the courts might be persuaded that it violates Section 28.  Mathen believes that ""would be a tough sell"" because Section 28 has generally been seen as an interpretive guide to the charter, not as conferring a stand-alone right.  Another argument revives Supreme Court rulings from the middle of the 20th century, in which the top court ruled that provincial laws limiting religious freedom were a matter of criminal law and, as such, could only be enacted by the federal government.  However, Mathen notes those rulings were made before the charter was enshrined in the Constitution in 1982. She doubts the courts would consider resurrecting them now.  Other arguments being advanced revolve around two unwritten principles that underlie the Constitution — the rule of law and protection of minority rights, both of which, Leckey notes, were specifically recognized by the Supreme Court in the 1998 reference on the legality of Quebec secession.    Leckey also argues that even if the notwithstanding clause ultimately prevents the court from striking down Bill 21, the wording of the clause doesn't preclude the court from issuing a judgment on the law. A damning ruling could have an impact on public opinion and dissuade the Quebec government from renewing its use of the notwithstanding clause in five years, as required by the Constitution.  Then there's the nuclear option: the federal government could use its constitutional power of disallowance to invalidate the law, a power that hasn't been used in 75 years. At Confederation, the federal cabinet was given the authority to invalidate provincial laws, typically when they were against the national interest in some way or stepped on federal jurisdiction.  The power was once used fairly freely but the last time was in 1943, on an Alberta law that forbade land sales to Hutterites and ""enemy aliens"" in the Second World War.  Mathen says that would be ""beyond the pale"" and would likely ""provoke a crisis in terms of federal-provincial relations; not just Quebec would object to that.""",politics
52,Do parties even have to put out a platform? Your election questions as Week 2 begins,"We've been hearing from voters across the country and expats around the world curious about all aspects of the upcoming federal election.   As leaders criss-cross the country, curiosity has been piqued. Here's what you were asking as the campaign entered its second week.  Do parties even have to put out a platform?  Technically no — though it's traditional for parties to put out some form of reading material. The NDP got their platform document out first, while the Greens and the Bloc just released theirs this week. We're still waiting on full releases from the Liberals, the Conservatives and the People's Party — they promise they will come in the next few weeks.  So what's the holdup? Alex Marland, a political science professor at Memorial University, said these documents take a long time to put together. He thinks the incumbent government could be at a disadvantage.  ""When you are in government, you're sticking around, doing more of the same,"" he said. So a platform can become a regurgitation of what you've already done or promised rather than specific new policy.  Former NDP Leader Jack Layton famously grilled then prime minister Stephen Harper during a 2008 election debate asking ""Where's your platform? Under the sweater?""    This is also the first year the Parliamentary Budget Officer is costing out party promises. Some parties are making use of that service in tandem with announcing policy, yet another step to take before going public.     Everyone might not have a full platform yet but we've still compared what's available    Who is allowed to use the term re-elect on campaign signs?   We've been flagged multiple times to Conservative candidate Stephen Woodworth's signs in Kitchener Centre. They've got ""re-elect"" on them. Woodworth was MP in the riding for seven years. The only problem is he's not the incumbent.  While some consider this misleading, what's on the sign does not fall under Elections Canada's purview. The Elections Act ""does not regulate the content of campaign signs"" in most circumstances. When we inquired, Elections Canada instead referred us to ""the candidates and political parties.""  In Woodworth's words: ""It would be underestimating the intelligence of the electorate to suggest that anyone believes that I'm the incumbent. People are better informed than that.""  There is some level of oversight from the Commissioner of Canada Elections, who deals with election sign complaints. If you have a problem with a sign, you can complain to the commissioner's office, which will look into each complaint on a case-by-case basis and see if it contravenes the Elections Act. That includes advertisements with certain types of false statements. Penalties can include fines or even charges.  The office would not comment on ""the legality of a specific issue."" ""We tend not to be looking at the content per se unless it meets specific criteria,"" said Michelle Laliberté, a spokesperson for the Commissioner's office.    I live in an apartmentu002Fcondo. Can I put up a lawn sign?  Yes — though you may not have a lawn, you still can put up a lawn sign.  If you're leasing, your property owners or the corporation can't prevent you from putting a sign up in your apartment or condo. Same rules apply if you own the unit.  However, there can be restrictions around how big the signs can be and whether they are allowed in common areas — so keep that in mind when you're picking a place for your sign.  How do I vote if I'm not at home during the voting period?   It's the most common question we've gotten since the election was called — we've heard stories about those who will be out of riding, out of province, even those temporarily living in places like the U.S. and Ukraine (shout out to the parents getting details for their travelling children!).  How you vote all depends on where you will be throughout the election period. If you are around through Oct. 15, you can go and vote for your riding at any Elections Canada office. Or you can vote in the advanced polls Oct. 11 through 14.  If you aren't around for any of that, you can vote by mail, which you can apply to do right now. If you're away, just make sure to give an address you know you'll be at so you can receive your voting kit.     Get more answers to questions about how to vote in our Voter Guide      Can you vote if you're on house arrest?  Yes, but how you do it depends on the conditions of your house arrest.  For those who are allowed to leave the house, you can vote during advance polling, on election day or at any Elections Canada office before Oct. 15. But if you're not allowed to leave home, you'll have to vote by mail. You can sign up to get a ballot kit sent to you now.  How do I vote none of the above if I don't trust any of the candidates?  You can't. None of the above isn't an option federally. There is no process for protesting or refusing a ballot in federal elections, like there is in some provincial and territorial elections.  If you go behind the voter screen and vote for no one or write none of the above on your ballot, your vote will be counted as a rejected ballot. Same deal if you refuse to go into a polling booth and hand back an unmarked ballot immediately.  These rejected ballots are included in the final vote count; there were 120,515 rejected nationally in 2015. However, they can't be considered votes for no one because many types of ballots are counted as rejected, including ones with multiple votes and ones that are improperly marked.  So, by percentage, which province has the most rejected ballots?  That would be Quebec — no other province or territory even comes close. More than 1.4 per cent of Quebecers had their ballots rejected in the 2015 election, equivalent to 62,271 votes.   In some ridings, the numbers were even higher. The Bloc Quebecois-held constituency of Montcalm was not only the Quebec riding with the highest percentage of rejected, it also had the highest percentage countrywide.  Almost 2.3 per cent of all votes, 1,226 of them, were rejected there.  And in case you want more:     Why isn't CBC News calling Justin Trudeau prime minister?

124,Liberals to re-record French version of campaign theme song after hitting sour note,"Are the Liberals removing one hand for tomorrow?   That's what some say the new French-language version of the federal party's theme song implies.  The English version of One Hand Up, recorded by The Strumbellas, goes, ""We can hold one hand up for tomorrow. We can hold one hand up to the stars.""  In French, the same line translates as: ""On lève une main haute pour demain. On lève une main haute aux étoiles.""  But instead of ""on lève,"" which means ""we raise,"" some say they hear ""enlève,"" which means to remove.  While that misunderstanding may boil down to mispronunciation, other parts of the song make little sense in French, critics say.  ""Google Translate does not sing,"" one Twitter user, Lyne Labrèche, wrote to Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau on Sunday.  ""I repeat, Google Translate does not sing.""  The criticism appears to have had an effect. The Liberals said early Monday they are planning to record a new version of the song.  The song first appeared in English on the Ontario band's Rattlesnake album released earlier this year.  The French version of the song, posted in a short video clip to social media by the Liberals, has been viewed more than 100,000 times since it was released Sunday morning.    The Liberals say it was translated by the band for the campaign.  MNA Gaétan Barrette, a member of the Quebec Liberal Party, slammed the song on Twitter.  ""I listened to it a dozen times and I have not yet understood all the lyrics,"" he wrote, calling it a ""very bad French translation that is very, very, very embarrassing.""",entertainment
50,Cameron Ortis back in court Sept. 27 on spy charges,"The lawyer for Cameron Ortis, the RCMP intelligence director accused of preparing to share classified secrets, says he's still waiting for key information.  Last week, Cameron Ortis, 47, was charged under the Security of Information Act.  The director general of the RCMP's national intelligence co-ordination centre is accused of preparing to share sensitive information with a foreign entity or terrorist organization. He's also charged with sharing operational information back in 2015.  Defence lawyer Ian Carter said he only has an initial synopsis of the case against Ortis and is expecting to receive more disclosure early next week.    Ortis, who appeared in court today by video in an orange jumpsuit and thick dark-rimmed glasses, will be back in court Sept. 27 to set a bail hearing.  He was solemn and quiet, saying only ""Yes, your honour I understand,"" and ""Thank you.""  RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki has called the allegations ""extremely unsettling.""  According to documents viewed by CBC, the cache of classified intelligence material Ortis allegedly was preparing to share is so vital to Canada's national security that the country's intelligence agencies say its misuse would strike at the heart of Canada's security.",politics
156,"One year after a ruling in their favour, Loblaws delivery drivers still waiting for overtime pay","On a good day, Faisel Osman gets back to his home in Kitchener, Ont., early enough to see his four children before bedtime. But with a shift that starts at 10 a.m. — and runs anywhere from 10 to 12 hours — that doesn't always happen.  ""It's kind of tough. If I come early, maybe before they get sleep, I get to spend a little bit of time with them,"" said Osman, a 36-year-old delivery driver for Loblaws.  For the past six years, he has worked out of the company's Maple Grove distribution centre in Cambridge, Ont., spending his days driving to places like Mississauga, Woodstock or even as far as London, about 1.5 hours away. Despite the long work days, Osman is only paid overtime if he works more than 60 hours a week.  Last September, an arbitrator ruled this practice violates Ontario's Employment Standards Act (ESA), which requires employees to receive overtime pay after working 44 hours a week. But one year after that decision came down, Loblaws has not changed the way it pays its Cambridge distribution centre drivers, nor has it paid employees any back wages.    No one from Loblaws would agree to an interview with CBC News. But in a statement, the company said it's been operating for close to a decade under a collective agreement with the union and drivers.  ""Recently, specific overtime compensation details were challenged. That disagreement continues,"" the statement reads.  Additional overtime pay — which is 1.5 times the employee's regular hourly rate — is something that Osman said would translate into hundreds of extra dollars a month for him — money he could use as the sole breadwinner for his growing family. His wife is due with their fifth child in December.  ""It's very hard now these days … you try your best with whatever you can to survive,"" said Osman. ""Loblaws is the biggest [grocery] company in Canada.… They can do better than this.""  Initial grievance  The grievance against Loblaws was filed in 2014 by Trevor Enos, a driver who has 35 years with the company. Like Osman, he works out of the Maple Grove distribution centre in Cambridge.   ""I went from a 52-hour week to a 60-hour a week, to make $15,000 a year less,"" said Enos. Prior to 2010, he said, drivers were paid overtime once they worked over the provincially designated minimum.  What changed in 2010? The union that represents the drivers — UFCW 1006A — and its members went through collective bargaining and signed a new contract with Loblaws. It included the 60-hour provision in addition to a host of other changes, like ""activity-based compensation,"" which pays drivers based on specific work assignments as opposed to straight hours of work.    Like Osman, Enos said he loves his job, his team and working for the company. But he said he filed the grievance because of the impact it was having on junior drivers who have a much lower hourly wage and used to rely heavily on overtime pay.   ""They say, 'Trevor, you know I can't make enough money. I'm struggling.' That's hard,"" Enos said.  Other drivers, like Hamilton resident Peter Simon, say they've had to find second jobs over the years to make ends meet.  ""I've had to do other stuff on the side to take care of myself,"" said Simon, who has worked for the company since 2002, also out of the Cambridge distribution centre.  Roughly six months after the overtime rules changed in 2010, Simon started taking up construction jobs to supplement his income.  ""You're getting paid for your 14-hour days, but you're not really getting paid for your true 14, with the overtime itself,"" he said ""With that, you're looking at a good little chunk of money right there, whether it's an extra $200 or $300 a week itself. Over the period of time, it all adds up.""    In arbitration hearings, Loblaws argued that drivers at the Cambridge distribution centre are exempt from ESA rules because they fall under the category of highway transport drivers, who can work up to 60 hours a week before overtime kicks in.   After four years of hearings, arbitrator Gordon F. Luborsky ruled the drivers' job duties did fall under the ESA, therefore entitling drivers to overtime pay after working more than 44 hours.  Luborsky didn't outline, however, how much Loblaws should pay in back wages or offer any guidance on that matter. He instead insisted both sides work together on a settlement.  One year later, no settlement has been reached and Loblaws is now challenging the arbitrator's decision. The company has filed a judicial review and wants an Ontario Divisional Court judge to quash the decision.  ""Loblaws seems to want to drag this out because of the money that is involved here. We're talking hundreds of thousands of dollars,"" said Wayne Hanley, president of UFCW 1006A.  The union continues to press the company to pay up, Hanley said, but it seems like there's a lack of urgency to resolve the issue.  ""That's unfair and we would encourage Loblaws to come to the table and have some progressive talks on how this can be remedied,"" he said.   'This is going to impact thousands of employees'  Sunira Chaudhri, a partner with Levitt LLP, said it's not often that you see a union matter like this escalate to the point of a judicial review — because the whole point of a collective agreement is for unions and management to work together to resolve a grievance.  Chaudhri said the arbitration decision is an affirmation that it doesn't matter what two sides agree to — in this case, a 60-hour work week before overtime is given — if it's a violation of the ESA, it's not enforceable.    ""[This decision is] a reminder that you can't contract out of legislation — minimum legislation — in this province and in this country,"" she said.   Chaudhri also suggested that others are going to be looking at this decision closely.  ""I think it's unequivocal that this case is going to lead to other unions taking a closer look at the Employment Standards Act and making sure that employers are definitely at least meeting the minimums,"" she said.  ""This is going to impact thousands of employees — if not hundreds of thousands — in terms of employees that might be looking to a decision like this to get them overtime pay sooner.""  A spokesperson with Teamsters Local 91, an Ottawa-based union that represents Loblaws drivers in that city, told CBC News it has followed the lead of Trevor Enos and UFCW 1006A, filing a grievance that argues its 67 drivers are not being paid overtime beyond 44 hours. The grievance was filed just two months after last September's decision from the arbitrator in the Cambridge case.     Loblaws has different agreements with different drivers in different regions. In New Brunswick, for example, its 60 drivers are represented by the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers' International Union (BCTGM). A union member told CBC News that they're not paid overtime at all unless they work a statutory holiday.  Loblaws statement  In a statement to CBC News, Loblaws said it has calculated the disputed overtime money owed since last September's decision and has set it aside.  ""[We] are paying that into a trust account as we await the final determination by the Court,"" the statement read.  The company wouldn't answer questions about how much money is in that trust or how it calculated the amount.  That's no consolation to drivers' and union steward Roger Siroky, who just wants to see the company follow the arbitrator's ruling.  ""I would like to see the drivers being paid overtime starting next week as step one,"" he said. ""I don't know how an award can come down and them not [pay] it.""",business
19,"In some battleground ridings, renters spend 50% or more of income on housing","Housing affordability is poised to be a major ballot box issue in the upcoming federal election, with a sizeable portion of renters in some of the country's battleground ridings spending half or more of their income on housing.  An analysis of the numbers in Statistics Canada's 2016 long-form census that examined income, affordability and overcrowding across Canada's 338 federal electoral districts shows that five of the country's worst ridings for rental housing affordability also happen to be among the ridings with the tightest races between the parties.  Of the 20 ridings with the toughest affordability challenges, 11 are in Ontario and six are in British Columbia, with Nova Scotia, Quebec and Manitoba rounding out the list with one riding each, according to the 2019 Canadian Rental Housing Index, released Tuesday.    In those ridings, a quarter or more of renters reported spending at least 50 per cent of their income on rent and utilities. (Utilities were included in rent figures because the data didn't allow for costs to be separated out, according to the index.)  ""These numbers clearly demonstrate why Canadians and housing advocates have been calling on our political leaders to take more immediate action to address the affordability challenges impacting so many families and individuals across the country,"" said Jill Atkey, CEO of the BC Non-Profit Housing Association, in a news release.  ""Whichever party forms the next government will need to increase the investments into the National Housing Strategy in order to achieve its goals before this crisis gets even worse.""  5 swing ridings on the list  Of the ridings identified in the index, Willowdale in Toronto was the worst for rental affordability; 39 per cent of renters there reported spending half or more of their income toward rent.  CBC News has identified five swing ridings on StatsCanada's top-20 list for costly housing: Richmond Hill, King-Vaughan, Aurora-Oak Ridges-Richmond Hill and Don Valley North in Ontario; and Burnaby North-Seymour in B.C.  The other Ontario ridings on the list are:     Thornhill   Markham-Unionville   University Rosedale   Mississauga Centre   Toronto Centre   Waterloo    In British Columbia:     Vancouver Quadra   Richmond Centre   West-Vancouver-Sunshine Coast-Sea to Sky Country   Vancouver Centre   Burnaby South.     Rounding out the list are Ville-Marie-Le Sud Ouest-Île-des-Soeurs in Quebec, Halifax in Nova Scotia and Winnipeg South in Manitoba.   Affordability issues not lost on federal leaders  The crisis of affordability in some markets hasn't been lost on campaigning party leaders. Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau promised last week to provide more help to first first-time homebuyers living in red-hot housing markets, including Toronto and Vancouver.  The Liberal plan would expand the number of first-time buyers eligible under the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation's shared-equity program by increasing the value of a qualifying home from approximately $500,000 to nearly $800,000.  Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer plans to offer his own proposal on home ownership, according to the party's spokesperson.       The data clearly demonstrates that our political leaders have not been able to find or implement meaningful solutions to the affordable housing crisis.  - Jeff Morrison, Canadian Housing and Renewal Association     Whether the leaders will come out with campaign commitments specifically aimed at renters remains to be seen.  ""The data clearly demonstrates that our political leaders have not been able to find or implement meaningful solutions to the affordable housing crisis, and Ontario now has the dubious honour of being harder hit than anywhere else in the country,"" said Marlene Coffey, executive director of the Ontario Non-Profit Housing Association.  The index released Tuesday also paints a picture of those hardest hit by affordability challenges: single mothers, Indigenous renters, new immigrants, seniors and Canadians under 30.  That last group is comprised largely of millennials, who are expected to make up as much as 37 per cent of the electorate in this election, according to Abacus Data.  Nearly a quarter of renters under 30 are at what the index defines as a ""crisis level of spending,"" with half or more of their income going to rent — while at least half of seniors who rent spent 30 per cent or more of their income on housing.  'Vulnerable groups are bearing the brunt'  ""For a long time, the conversation around rental housing affordability in Canada has focused on the population as a whole, but the numbers clearly show several key, vulnerable groups are bearing the brunt of this crisis,"" said Jeff Morrison, executive director of the Canadian Housing and Renewal Association.    A disproportionate share of Indigenous families were also found to be struggling to pay rent, and overcrowding was found to be an issue in 43 per cent of Indigenous-led renter households, compared with just six per cent in non-Indigenous renter households.  Among immigrants now renting shelter who landed in Canada from 2011 to 2016, nearly 24 per cent were found to be at a crisis level in terms of the percentage of household income spent on shelter. In terms of overcrowding and overspending, the hardest hit immigrant-led households are in the Greater Toronto Area, with 55 to 60 per cent of those households in Richmond Hill, Vaughan and Markham spending 30 per cent or more of their income on rent.  But those suburbs still might be the more affordable option for those looking to own a home in Toronto — people like new mom Jessica Botello.    Botello said she's encouraged by Trudeau's housing proposal but thinks ultimately it's better suited to those looking outside the city core.    ""Honestly, it's a great idea, but for $800,000, it's not realistic for Toronto,"" she told CBC Radio's Metro Morning.  Botello recently put in an offer for a home in Toronto, only to find six others did as well. Ultimately, the home sold for $840,000 — a price she said she simply couldn't compete with.  ""We were pre-approved for $745,000,"" she told Metro Morning. ""But if it's listed for that price, they want multiple offers — and they get them.""    What matters to you this election?

197,Federal public servants warned about online posts while in 'caretaker' mode,"The country's top civil servant is sending a stern warning to government workers as part of his election campaign guidelines, reminding them to be extra careful about what they say on social media.  The ""caretaker convention"" rules are circulated internally at the start of every federal election campaign and this is the second time the Privy Council Office has posted the document online for public consumption.  The guidelines set out the rules federal civil servants need to follow to avoid any hint of partisanship in a politically charged election campaign.  While civil servants aren't banned from spending their private time helping any candidate or party, the guidelines say, they should make sure any political activity doesn't ""impair or could be perceived as impairing"" their ability to work impartially for any party that forms government — including an ill-advised tweet, Instagram or Facebook post.  ""Employees should consider the nature of their current public-service duties, the level and visibility of their position, the nature of the political activity and their personal visibility,"" the guidelines say as part of a new addition to the document.  ""Particular attention should be paid to potentially highly visible public activities, notably the use of personal social media accounts.""  Deleted departmental tweet  A spokesperson for the Privy Council Office, the central bureaucracy that aids the prime minister and cabinet, said the warning was added this year ""given the role of social media during an election campaign.""  Officials had a recent reminder of that when a federal Twitter account tweeted, then deleted, a post about anti-racism strategy spending in the hours after images emerged of Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau in blackface when he was a young man.     Leaders talk financial relief, but Trudeau still quizzed over blackface scandal   Why wearing blackface or brownface is considered 'reprehensible'    Most government promotion comes to a grinding halt during an election period, lest it be seen as promoting the party seeking re-election.  The Privy Council Office said the tweet on Thursday stemmed from a correction Canadian Heritage made to an online version of a news release.  The news release was originally sent on Sept. 6 before the campaign kicked off, and noted a funding pledge of about $3.5 million when the correct amount was $3.25 million.  The correction created a revised tweet, ""making it appear as though this was a new funding announcement, which it was not,"" PCO spokesman Stephane Shank said Friday.  So PCO asked the department to delete the tweet ""given the possible perception"" of new spending commitments.    Governments are expected to act with restraint until after election day and MPs convene in Ottawa again, because even if the government appears to have been re-elected, it can't assume it will have the confidence of the House of Commons while there is no elected chamber to say so.  The prime minister and cabinet retain their positions to do routine business and respond to emergencies, although any major decisions are usually done in consultation with opposition parties — an issue spelled out in the 2019 ""caretaker"" guidelines.  While most of the 2019 guidelines mirror the 2015 document, there are some additions aside from the warning about social-media use.  Departments are told they can implement regulations approved before Parliament's dissolution, but should be more ""reactive as opposed to proactive"" when it comes to communicating with affected groups or organizations.  Regulatory initiatives that are ""high-profile or controversial"" should be avoided as much as possible, this year's guidelines say.  There is also a section on what happens if there is any attempt by foreign actors to manipulate the results of the Oct. 21 vote.  A panel of top civil servants have been tasked with alerting the public should such a situation arise.",technology
187,"Vapes need same restrictions as tobacco, medical groups tell federal parties","There's an urgent need for vaping products to be given the same advertising and flavour restrictions as tobacco, a group of health organizations in Canada said in calling for immediate political action.  The appeal came Thursday at a news conference in Ottawa from representatives of:     Action on Smoking and Health.   Canadian Cancer Society.   Canadian Medical Association.   Canadian Lung Association.   Coalition québécoise pour le contrôle du tabac.   Heart &amp; Stroke.   Ontario Campaign for Action on Tobacco.   Physicians for a Smoke-Free Canada.    ""We've just unleashed a torrent of addiction amongst young people in Canada through our thoughtless disregard of the need for effective regulation of these products,"" Dr. Andrew Pipe, Heart &amp; Stroke board chair and a smoking cessation physician in Ottawa, said in an interview. ""Now we're playing catch-up in Canada, and we're in an almost unforgivable situation.""  On Wednesday, health officials in London, Ont., announced what's believed to be the first case in Canada of a respiratory illness linked to vaping. The high-school-age individual used e-cigarettes daily, was initially on life-support and is now recovering at home.  The key missing piece of information in London's case is what was in the cartridge, said Dr. Samir Gupta, a respirologist and associate professor in the department of medicine at the University of Toronto.  Public hospitals in Ontario have been asked to provide the province's chief medical officer of health with statistical, non-identifying information related to incidences of vaping-related severe pulmonary disease.  ""Clinicians have reported to Toronto Public Health [TPH] that they had encountered a small number of patients in recent weeks who potentially had vaping-related severe illness,"" Dr. Michael Finkelstein, Toronto's associate medical officer of health, said in an emailed statement.  TPH said it has asked clinicians to ask their patients to share illness-related information. ""We have yet to receive this information,"" Finkelstein said.    The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 530 confirmed and probable cases of lung injury related to e-cigarettes as of Tuesday. The agency said Thursday that based on gender and age information on 373 people, 72 per cent were male and 67 per cent were 18 to 34.   No single device, ingredient, additive or pathway to illness has been identified in the U.S. investigation. Most of the people reported using tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, the main component in cannabis that gives users a high) or both THC and nicotine. Some of the cases have reported using only nicotine, CDC said.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is now investigating more than 150 products and substances and said it has activated its criminal investigations arm to explore the supply chain of vaping products and identify the cause of the illnesses. No individual vapers will be targeted, said Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products.  During the current Canadian election campaign, the health groups involved in Thursday's news conference called on all parties to commit, within 60 days should they form government, to stop promotions for vaping products on television, radio, billboards, public transit hubs, convenience stores, social media, newspapers and other mainstream media.    The groups said manufacturers are allowed to entice youth and non-smokers with attractive flavours, give the products away and have no obligations for nicotine limits or health warnings on packages as in this case for tobacco.  The medical groups want a nicotine level restriction of 20 mgu002FmL similar to in the European Union. The current maximum is 66 mgu002FmL. The U.S. has no nicotine limit for e-cigarette products, said Rob Cunningham, senior policy analyst with the Canadian Cancer Society.   ""We do not need to wait for a death in Canada to warrant action,"" said Terry Dean, CEO of the Canadian Lung Association.    In Ontario, advertising of e-cigarettes is currently permitted in convenience stores and gas stations.  ""Once we understand what the concern is, then we'll look at any steps necessary in order to protect the health of our young people,"" Ontario Health Minister Christine Elliott said Thursday.   Keep on top of symptoms, Health Canada urges  The Canadian Vaping Association said it wants federal, provincial and territorial governments to immediately ban certain marketing. The group said it represents vape store owners, not vaping brands.   Advertising ""must be removed from all convenience stores, gas stations or any retail location that is not age restricted,"" the association said in a statement.  Health Canada has been urging people who vape to watch for symptoms such as coughing, shortness of breath, fatigue, diarrhea, vomiting and chest pain. It has also said health-care professionals should ask patients about their use of e-cigarette products if they have respiratory symptoms.  Health Canada said Thursday it has consulted on proposed new regulatory measures to further restrict vaping product advertising ""to protect youth from inducements to using these products, including restricting the display of vaping products at points of sale.""  The U.S. media companies CBS, WarnerMedia and Viacom said they'll drop e-cigarette advertising, CNBC reported.   In the U.S., Michigan and New York state have voted to ban flavoured e-cigarettes.",health
21,U.S. strike against GM could lead to Canadian layoffs,"As 49,000 United Auto Workers in the U.S. strike against General Motors, there's a risk the walkout could shut down GM Canada's plants and auto-parts makers in Ontario.  And that means layoffs of some of GM's 5,700 Canadian workers and others throughout the auto sector.  GM Canada says it is monitoring the situation closely for any impact to Canadian operations.  The North American auto industry is highly integrated, with assembly plants here in Canada reliant on parts coming from the U.S. and Mexico.   GM has three plants in Ontario — assembly plants in Ingersoll and Oshawa, and an engine and transmission plant in St. Catharines.  Because the auto supply chain is integrated, Canadian plants could soon be unable to continue working because of a shortage of parts. GM Canada did not say how soon Canadian plants might be affected.  But it could happen quickly. GM uses ""just-in-time"" delivery, which means hundreds of parts are moving across the border every day.   About 80 per cent of the engines St. Catharines is building are destined for cars assembled in the U.S., says Jerry Dias, president of Canadian union Unifor. Workers there could face layoffs within days, he told CBC News.  At the Ingersoll assembly plant, about half the engines they put in cars come from the U.S. Dias estimates they may have to halt operations within 10 days.  GM has not said how many days of parts it has in reserve.  It would be about two months before auto dealerships are affected by a shortage of product, according to the parent company.  Different union, different contract schedule  Canadian workers are represented by a separate union, Unifor, and its contract schedule is different from the U.S. Contracts do not expire until September 2020 and September 2021.  But Unifor issued a statement on Sunday saying it ""supports the UAW in negotiations for a fair contract settlement with General Motors.""  Dias says one of the big issues is how many jobs are being lost to Mexico with its very low wages.  ""We had a dispute with GM in 2017 at the CAMI plant. We thought it would be quick, but it went on for almost a month.  ""The issue was about General Motors' decision to build the Equinox in Mexico. That is what is taking place in the U.S. GM announced the closure of four plants. They're beefing up investment in Mexico and the workers in the U.S., like in Canada, have had enough.""  GM's Oshawa assembly plant is set to close at the end of the year, one of five plants in North America that the auto giant is closing.    That is one of the key issues for the UAW in the U.S., which is pressing GM to schedule new models for the four U.S. plants it is closing.  Unifor has pressed GM Canada unsuccessfully to extend the life of the Oshawa plant, arguing the automaker made a commitment to at least 2020 when it accepted the 2008 government bailout.    GM is negotiating a shift toward more electric cars and investing heavily in automation, considered among the key trends in the auto industry.  North American car sales have boomed in the past three years, but are stagnating this year as young consumers put off owning vehicles.  But GM made $8 billion in profit in 2018 and the UAW is arguing it deserves a wage hike and better benefits to share in the good fortune.  Much depends on length of strike  It's not just GM plants here in Canada, but also other auto-parts makers that could be affected.  That's one reason Flavio Volpe, president of Canada's Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association, hopes the dispute will be quickly resolved.  Within three or four days, it starts affecting people's shifts, Volpe told Bloomberg.  The last strike by the UAW was in 2007, and it only lasted 17 hours, so there was not much impact on Canadian operations.  Before that a strike at just two major parts plants in Flint, Mich., in 1998 that lasted 54 days eventually shut down much of GM's North American operations.  A long strike could have a big impact on Canadian workers. But it might not significantly affect the Canadian and U.S. economy.  If the strike lasts to the end of September, it would take only 0.1 per cent off annualized U.S. GDP growth in the third quarter, according to CIBC economist Avery Shenfeld.  ""Impacts on Canada would be even more modest. Just to give a sense of scale, in the unlikely case where the strike lasts through [the fourth quarter] in its entirety, it would subtract a more meaningful 0.7 per cent off that quarter's annualized pace in the U.S., and take a bit of a shine off Canada as well.""",business
84,"India bans e-cigarettes, dashing Juul and Philip Morris expansion plans","India banned the production, import and sale of electronic cigarettes on Wednesday, a public health decision that will dash the expansion plans of companies such as Juul Labs and Philip Morris International in the country.  The ban will be imposed through an executive order and will include jail terms of up to three years for offenders. It was not clear whether the use of such products would be prohibited.  India's health ministry, which proposed the ban, had said it was needed to ensure e-cigarettes don't become an ""epidemic"" among children and young adults.  ""Considering the seriousness of the impact of e-cigarettes on the youth, the cabinet has approved an ordinance to ban e-cigarettes,"" Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman told a news conference.  India has 106 million adult smokers, second only to China in the world, making it a lucrative market for companies making vaping products such as U.S.-based Juul, as well as Philip Morris which manufactures a heat-not-burn tobacco device.    While announcing the ban, Sitharaman showed various types of products to the media, including a Juul vaping device that resembles a USB flash drive.  Juul had plans to launch its e-cigarette in India and has hired several senior executives in recent months. Philip Morris also has plans to launch its heat-not-burn smoking device in India, Reuters has reported.  Juul and other vaping companies have come under increased scrutiny in the U.S. amid multiple lawsuits, several deaths and possibly hundreds of illnesses tied to e-cigarettes, which are used to inhale nicotine vapour without smoking.  A spokeswoman for Juul in India declined to comment. Philip Morris did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Vaping advocates denounce ban  The ban order needs to be approved by the president before it takes effect, but this is typically a formality.  Advocates for e-cigarettes say vaping is far less harmful than smoking tobacco. But many tobacco-control activists are opposed to the devices, saying they could lead to nicotine addiction and push people toward consuming tobacco.  More than 900,000 people die each year in India due to tobacco-related illnesses.    The Association of Vapers India, an organization that represents e-cigarette users across the country, attacked the government's decision, saying it would deprive millions of smokers of a safer solution to cut back on smoking.  Shares in ITC, India's top cigarette maker, ended up nearly one per cent, while its rival Godfrey Phillips surged 5.2 per cent. E-cigarettes form just a tiny part of their product range.  The ban order will impose a jail term of up to one year and a fine of 100,000 rupees ($1,863 Cdn) for first-time offenders. A repeat violation would attract a jail term of up to three years and a penalty of up to 500,000 rupees ($9,315 Cdn), the government said.    The ban would apply to the manufacture, import, sale, advertisement and distribution of e-cigarettes.  Such executive orders are typically issued as an emergency measure when Indian parliament is not in session. The ban order could lapse if it is not approved when lawmakers convene against in the next session of parliament, which will most likely be held in November.  Democrats threaten to subpoena Juul  Meanwhile in Washington, Democrats threatened Wednesday to subpoena Juul Labs if the it does not provide documents relating to its products and marketing practices, as a House panel looks into whether the company deliberately targeted children.  In June, Raja Krishnamoorthi, chairman of the House Oversight Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy, asked for documents relating to information, including Juul's relationship with schools, and the tobacco giant Altria Group Inc's purchase of a portion of the firm. He said in a statement on Wednesday Juul had not complied with the request.    The House subcommittee ordered Juul, which is privately held, to produce the documents by Oct. 1, or ""we may have no choice but to seek compulsory process,"" Krishnamoorthi wrote in a letter to the company on Tuesday.  Juul faces about 30 lawsuits, with more expected, alleging it illegally marketed products to children, failed to issue warnings to consumers about their dangers and defectively designed products.  The company has yanked some flavour pods from retail shelves and changed its advertising to feature older models, but has continued to sell menthol and mint flavours.  U.S. health regulators have signaled plans to stop the sale of all flavoured e-cigarettes.",health
109,"Forget the treadmill: An intense game of chess can burn hundreds of calories, research suggests","Read Story Transcript  When it comes to losing weight, a couple of intense hours devising the perfect checkmate could be just as effective as pounding a treadmill, according to some research.  In 2018, several competitors at the Isle of Man International chess competition had their heart rates measured while they played.   After a two-hour game, grandmaster Mikhail Antipovhad burned 560 calories — the equivalent of more than a five-mile run.    That calorific burn comes from the stress of the game — increased heart anbd breathing rates, as well as elevated blood pressure — all of which can add up to weight loss.  The 1984 World Chess Championship was called off after five months with both competitors — Anatoly Karpov and Garry Kasparov — experiencing exhaustion. Karpov was reported to have lost close to 20 lbs.  A recent ESPN article quoted Professor Robert Sapolsky, who in a 2009 speech at Stanford University said that a high-level chess player can burn up to 6,000 calories a day while playing in a tournament.  More recent research has since suggested the figure could be closer to 132 calories per hour, which would equate to 1,188 calories over a nine-hour game.    Maurice Ashley is a chess grandmaster and commentator who says that these days, the best chess players train on both chess boards and treadmills.  He spoke to The Current's interim host Laura Lynch about why the game needs both brains and brawn. Here is part of their conversation.  What were your thoughts when you heard players can burn hundreds of calories just from two hours of playing chess?  It's a reminder of what our sport is about at the highest levels, because it is intense. It is stressful. It's always razor's edge — every move could be a mistake. And that kind of pressure does lead to a lot of stress and subsequently a lot of calories burned.    The physical strain apparently is so great that players often drop weight during tournaments. What was the most extreme case of that?   Well, probably the worst case was Anatoly Karpov, when he played his world champion match against Garry Kasparov back in the mid-80s. They played a really long match — it was called ""the unlimited match"" because instead of having a set number of games, it was the first person to win six games. And they couldn't get the six wins, they were so tightly matched.  And by the end Anatoly Karpov literally looked like death. I mean the guy's skin was just like hanging off his bones, it was so bad. They stopped the match and decided to play a new match that had a limited number of games. That kind of extreme example is bad because that match actually lasted months. But you could see quite a bit of that happening with players.    Have there been other instances of severe weight loss?  Not clearly … as certain as that one. I think today's players are much more cognizant of the fact that you have to stay in shape, you have to exercise, be ready for the rigours of that kind of tournament intensity. Today's players are much more keen on it. They'll focus on their diet, proper eating, proper exercise and I think that they're more steeled for competition than ever.  How have chess regulations changed to address this fact of extreme weight loss?  It has not. I don't think that problem exists with players today. The players are just much fitter; they workout on treadmills before, sometimes after games. Often after games in fact, just to get rid of whatever pent-up stress they had coming from the game, and wind down.    You're a grandmaster. Have you ever experienced that type of weight fluctuation?  No, I've always been pretty fit, pretty much aware of the kind of diet I eat, and really focusing on being healthy.   You burn calories, but as long as you keep that voracious appetite up then you can always just get it back. So it's really about staying alert to the possible dangers of all that stress and potential weight loss and then just managing it.    Maybe you can give me a bit of insight here because when I see really good chess players playing, they look so stoic. And I would think that what they're really doing is just trying to slow things down, including their heart rate, to be able to focus on what's at hand. What's actually going on beneath the visage?   My friends would look at me and say: ""When we're watching you play ... we don't know if you're winning, you're losing, it's equal."" They never know, but that's because my face, it has that resting angry face, you know, like I'm just trying to kill the guy.   But inside? The heart rate's up. You think you're doing well and all of a sudden you realize you made a small mistake, and it's like ""Oh man, this is gonna turn around,"" and you're trying to, as you said, slow things down and manage the emotional boiling that's happening inside.     I suppose that the physical fitness would help you not be drenched in sweat when you're facing the board?   You're going to sweat anyway — you're not going to be drenched in sweat though, but I mean it is that kind of thing. Imagine if you were to take a college finals.  You study like crazy the night before. Then you go to the finals and you have to take that test. Imagine thinking back-to-back finals on the same day, because chess games can last five, six hours. And imagine that the finals is actually fighting back! It's changing as you're trying to get the right answer.  Well that's what you're doing when you're facing an opponent. Your best ideas you're putting down, and the opponent's like: ""Nope, I've got a better idea,"" and they're hitting back. And then imagine doing that nine days in a row. That is the kind of intensity that chess competition is about, and you have to be ready for those rigours.    Written by Padraig Moran. Produced by Samira Mohyeddin.",technology
14,Statistics Canada reports manufacturing sales fell 1.3% in July,"Statistics Canada says manufacturing sales fell 1.3 per cent to $57.2 billion in July as sales in the primary metal and motor vehicle industries moved lower.  The agency says sales were down in 11 industries in July, representing 66.8 per cent of total manufacturing sales.  Economists had expected a decline of 0.2 per cent, according to financial markets data firm Refinitiv.  Statistics Canada says primary metal industry sales fell 7.3 per cent in July as every primary metal industry except alumina and aluminum production and processing reported lower sales.  Motor vehicle industry sales dropped 4.7 per cent due in part to an extended shutdown at a major assembly plant for maintenance projects to support new model production.  Manufacturing sales in constant dollars were down 1.6 per cent in July, indicating that a lower volume of products was sold.",business
42,Singh says he'll meet Trudeau to accept apology only if it's in private and politics-free,"NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said today he'd be happy to meet with Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau to discuss racism in the wake of the prime minister's blackface revelations — provided the meeting happens in private and is not used for political purposes.  ""His office reached out and I have indicated that I am open to having a conversation, as long as it remains private and I am not in any way used as a way for the Liberal Party to redeem the situation,"" Singh told CBC Radio's The House in an interview airing Saturday. ""That is for Canadians to make the decision.""  Trudeau has been in damage control mode since Wednesday evening, when pictures of him in blackface were published by an American magazine.  Time Magazine first reported that Trudeau had darkened his skin with makeup and dressed in a turban with long flowing robes when he attended an Arabian Nights-themed gala in 2001 at West Point Grey Academy, a private school in Vancouver, B.C., where he used to work.    Trudeau held an emergency press conference on his campaign plane Wednesday evening. He apologized for his behaviour and admitted to another blackface incident while he was a student at at Le collège Jean-de-Brébeuf in Montreal.  On Thursday, a third instance of Trudeau wearing blackface came to light when a video surfaced showing him with his face, arms and legs painted black while wearing an afro wig.  Trudeau shed more light on that third incident earlier today. ""It was a costume day for river guides in the white water rafting operation that I worked at in the summer between 1992 and 1994, roughly,"" he said in Toronto.  Apologizing to Singh personally  Singh said that Trudeau's efforts to rebuild his image should start with Canadians.  ""There are a lot of people right now who are seeing the prime minister of this country mocking their reality, mocking their lived experience, and it's going to bring up a lot of pain for a lot of folks that's going to remind them of the insults they've heard their whole life,"" Singh told host Chris Hall.  ""It's going to remind them of the physical violence they may have suffered, the barriers, and it's really those Canadians that need to be at the heart of anything that happens.""  Trudeau said that he is onside with Singh in the NDP leader's efforts to combat Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, racism and intolerance and is looking forward to speaking with him personally.  ""I will be apologizing to him personally as a racialized Canadian, as I have been apologizing to Canadians who have suffered discrimination and intolerance their entire lives in ways that some of us, like me, have never had to experience on a daily basis,"" Trudeau said.",politics
155,Soaring rents and house prices in Canadian cities make housing a key election issue,"Jeff Gallant lived in his new home just 17 days before the For Sale sign went up.  Soon after the single dad rented the house, it was sold and the new owners sent him notice of a major renovation that would force Gallant and his two young children to leave. A similar thing occurred at his previous place, and it's happening to so many renters in Charlottetown that a new term has been born: Renoviction.  Charlottetown is a prime example of the scarce vacancies and spiraling costs facing renters in communities across the country.  ""It's getting ridiculous,"" Gallant says of the rental market. ""Prices have doubled pretty much, and that boils back to supply and demand. They know there's nothing here, [so landlords] jack up the price.""  Cost of living is a big election issue, a CBC News-commissioned online poll from June suggests, and housing is the biggest single expense for most Canadians, according to Statistics Canada figures on annual household spending.  As the campaign has unfolded, the federal parties have begun to unveil plans on how they'd make life more affordable for voters.  The Liberals aim to build 100,000 affordable housing units over a decade. They would also encourage home ownership through a first-time home-buyer incentive that subsidizes up to 10 per cent of the purchase of a new home and five per cent on resale homes — with restrictions.     The NDP have a more ambitious plan, committing to build 500,000 affordable housing units in a decade.  A central message of the Conservative campaign is that it wants people ""to get ahead, not just get by,"" and that the government needs to get its hand out of Canadians' pockets in areas like the carbon tax, which the party describes as ineffective. The Conservatives have promised to ease building regulations to increase the housing supply, and said Monday that if elected the party would change the maximum mortgage term, increasing it from 25 years to allow up to 30-year mortgages. It is also promising to review the ""stress test"" for first-time buyers applying for a mortgage.    Housing costs  The reality is that finding affordable housing is increasingly difficult in many parts of Canada.  The smallest provincial capital, Charlottetown, has one of the lowest rental vacancy rates in the country. It hovers just above zero per cent, new Kijiji listings last just minutes before apartments are snapped up, and renters complain about spending ever more of their limited dollars on housing.  It is an old axiom of financial planners that renters should never spend more than 30 per cent of their gross earnings on rent and utilities. In Charlottetown, low income renters (those earning less than $21,361) spend on average 62 per cent of their earnings on housing.  The numbers get only marginally better when income levels increase.    Data gathered by the Canadian Rental Housing Index shows that Toronto renters earning as much as $45,498 a year are dedicating 40 per cent of their earnings to monthly housing costs. Live outside the downtown core, in York or Peel region, and those middle income earners are paying an average of per cent 44 and 38 per cent respectively.   In Regina, low-income renters spend more than half their pre-tax earnings on rent and utilities. In Calgary it's 62 per cent, and 91 per cent in Vancouver.  This may help to explain why so many adult children are returning to live with their parents even after they've entered the workforce, or why many young adults choose to have roommates to defray living costs.      Check out your region's costs and compare it to others on the Rental Housing Index     Growing population  Across Canada, it's not simply a question of how much accommodation costs, but also about keeping up with the need for more places to live.  In 2018, there were 37,000 new apartments built nationwide, but demand increased by 50,000 units, according to tracking done by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.    And Canadian cities continue to grow, driven by factors such as immigration and stronger job numbers.  With housing-related problems rising and the cost of living a primary issue for Canadian voters, Charlottetown Mayor Philip Brown figures political party leaders in the midst of a federal election campaign should be talking more about it. When he was elected last year, he describes how he used a congratulatory phone call from the Prime Minister to drive home his top priority.  ""We have a problem with affordable and accessible housing,"" Brown says he told Justin Trudeau on a call shortly after his election as mayor in November 2018. ""We need more public spending from the provincial and federal governments to up the supply of affordable and accessible housing.""    Each community has its own housing challenges, and one of the big ones for Charlottetown is that short-term rentals for the city's giant tourism industry suck up a lot of housing stock.   Another is house prices — Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) data shows they've jumped 38.5 per cent in the past three years alone in P.E.I.'s capital. By comparison, prices rose 25.3 per cent in Toronto, 21.6 in Ottawa and 33.3 in Victoria. A market where buyers get into bidding wars is new for Canada's smallest province, which recently surpassed 153,000 residents, and it's persuading some landlords to sell.  Added to that, the province's population is growing, with people moving to P.E.I. from other nations and parts of Canada on both a permanent and temporary basis. The University of P.E.I. hasn't built a new residence in 14 years, for example, while its student population has increased by about a third. There have been significant increases in the number of students on campus requiring housing, with half now coming from out of province or out of country.  ""And that, in turn, is pushing more demand on downtown housing,"" Brown explains.  Holland College student Sierra Elkerton was debating whether she could even afford to stay in school after she was evicted by her landlord because the building was not up to code. She managed to find a new apartment, but for nearly double the monthly rent.  ""Realistically I don't want to pay that, but it looks like I'm going to have to,"" says Elkerton. ""The cost of living is way too high considering it's such a small city.""    She's not alone. A global survey by money manager BlackRock Inc. found ""many Canadians feel that they are in a financial squeeze — hard pressed to save amid what they perceive as a high cost of living, including devoting much of their income to paying for their homes.""  Canadians who responded to the poll said they spend an average of 43 per cent of their income on housing — whether renting or owning.   Among the 20 countries surveyed, only the Netherlands and Sweden had higher housing costs, at 51 per cent and 45 per cent respectively.    Charlottetown's mayor is well aware of the numbers. In his community, he's most focused on trying to help the people who find themselves paying more than they can afford — and those who can't find anything at all.  ""We may be a small city,"" he says, ""but we've got big city problems.""  The mayor says he would like to hear commitments from party leaders this election cycle to use the big federal wallet to help cities build more affordable housing.  ""I got two calls this past week and one visit to the office,"" Brown says. ""From a woman who was living in her car in the Walmart parking lot, and another woman that's been in [a shelter] now for almost a month and she needs a place to live.""",business
232,"For first time in history of Canada's National Ballet School, more boys than girls will graduate","Benjamin Alexander performs routine barre exercises in his afternoon class in a large bright studio within Canada's National Ballet School (NBS).  The set syllabus is taught by a male instructor, and Alexander, 16, is also surrounded by nine other boys — something that's now completely normal.  In Alexander's Grade 12 class, there are 16 boys and 11 girls, marking the first time in the institution's illustrious 60-year history that female ballet dancers are outnumbered.  The ratio surprises even Alexander, who said he used to feel like he was keeping a secret as a dancer growing up in Chatham-Kent, Ont.     ""At school, everyone was going to hockey practice and baseball practice, and I was there with my dance shoes and dance bag going off to dance class. It was hard,"" he told CBC Toronto.  ""Definitely, there was a feeling of solitude.""    Alexander says he was first inspired to dance by his older sister, and initially took up tap dancing. But then a Christmas performance role at his local dance studio caught his attention.  ""I wanted nothing more than to be a baby reindeer so I said, 'I'm going to start ballet classes,' and I never looked back since.""  The senior student is part of the school's professional ballet program, which requires students to audition. He says he's a lot more confident now, especially being surrounded by so many like-minded students in his program.  ""I look around at my class and see this group of amazing men who are all following this dream to become ballet dancers, and it's inspired me to work harder and even more passionately toward my dream.""  He says while there are still some stigmas that linger for male ballet dancers in 2019, he's seen some changes in his time at the school.     ""People don't generally understand how much passion, perseverance and determination it takes to become a male ballet dancer,"" he said.  ""I think that's shifted now. I think people realize we work extremely hard to become the top of our field.""  After he graduates, Alexander hopes to join a professional dance company, and has his eye on the Dutch National Ballet Academy of Amsterdam. But really he says he just hopes to keep doing what he loves ""and getting applause for it.""  Many of his sentiments are echoed by his 17-year-old classmate Andrew Larose, originally from London, Ont.    Larose was intrigued by dance after seeing Michael Jackson perform, but also amazed by Russian ballet dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov's grace and strength.  ""Even at a young age — 12 years old  — I knew that this was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life for as long as possible,"" Larose said.  The teen recalls growing up and being the only boy in his class and coming to the NBS and entering ""a whole new world.""  ""It's a dream come true seeing 16 boys and 11 girls in my graduating class. It's amazing.""  He says he's excited to see what the future holds for men in ballet.  ""It's great that now more people are opening up to this and realizing men dance.""  'Change takes time'  Mavis Staines has filled the role of artistic director and CEO of Canada's National Ballet School for the last three decades and has been witnessing this milestone class grow together for the last six years.  ""The ratio of men to women and making sure that there are as many male dancers as female dancers who have a chance to pursue their dream has been a passion of mine and my colleagues for a long time,"" Staines says.  The CEO explains that the school has been implementing community programs, including partnering with public schools, in order to expose kids to dance at a young age.    There was talk at one point of offering the classes to boys for free to encourage enrolment.  ""But as a woman, I couldn't stand the idea of offering classes to boys for free, and that young women didn't have the same opportunity. I thought that's not how I'm going to do it.""  While she says she believes that their community programs did help even out the numbers, there's also been an authentic shift in people's perceptions about ballet through shows and social media.    She also credits the popularity of the film and musical Billy Elliot, the story of an 11-year-old ballet dancer, as another push toward acceptance.  ""I think for a long time in North America, especially in Canada, parents, especially fathers, couldn't imagine their sons dancing,"" she said.  ""Genuine systemic change takes time.""  Staines said it's ""deeply exciting"" that the graduating class starting this month aligns with the school's 60th anniversary.   Proud teacher   Raymond Smith is a teacher at Canada's National Ballet School and is currently teaching the boys class of 2020.  ""It's so inspiring to work with these young men because they're passionate about ballet, and they want to learn, and they want to get ahead and they want to dance professionally,"" he said.  Smith danced at the school in the 70's and spent 20 years with the National Ballet of Canada, 15 of those years as a principal dancer.  ""I think it's more acceptable now,"" he said.  ""I think in my day I was lucky I wasn't teased because I played sports with the same people who would've teased me.""    Smith says in the future, he'd love to eventually see a ballet performance choreographed for a group of male dancers. He has taught this group for two years and is an awe of how much stronger they've become.   ""They're more dynamic, more artistic. They're not afraid to show who they are.""  For Alexander, he hopes that boys breaking ballet stereotypes continues to inspire new talent and end negative perceptions.      I just hope that little boys are no longer afraid — that they no longer have this predetermined thought that ballet is not for them.  - Benjamin Alexander, dance student     ""I just hope that little boys are no longer afraid — that they no longer have this predetermined thought that ballet is not for them,"" he said.  ""I hope if any boy wants to move and dance, they are free and able to do that.""  [PHOTOGALLERY]",entertainment
68,Older Canadians reinvent themselves as 'seniorpreneurs' — in hopes it'll pay off,"'Seniorpreneurs' are part of a quickly growing group of older Canadians who are choosing to work beyond the traditional retirement age of 65 — some as a financial necessity, others because they simply aren't ready to call it quits.  A pilot program specifically designed for senior entrepreneurs in Oshawa, Ont., tested the waters to see whether Canadian baby boomers not only want to keep working but also desire to be their own bosses.  The answer, according to program creator Pramilla Ramdahani, is a resounding yes.  ""How do we finance this new and growing sector, with so many talented ideas that bring a lifetime of skills to the table?"" said Ramdahani.  Ramdahani launched the Seniorpreneur Program 4 Innovation, Creativity, and Entrepreneurship, or SPICE, and received 75 applications for the 60 positions it offered in its first cohort in 2018-19.    Ramdahani says ageism was a big factor in creating a seniors-specific program. She says nearly all of the pilot participants identified ageism in the workplace or in applying for jobs as part of their reasoning for looking for something else.  ""Hence, they really want to create their own [jobs],"" said Ramdahani.  According to Statistics Canada, nearly 15 per cent of Canadians 65 years and older are still in the workforce, compared to around 6 per cent 20 years ago — and their entrepreneurial spirits are strong.    Nearly half of small business owners are baby boomers, according to a new online poll by Ipsos commissioned by RBC, conducted between June 21 and June 24, 2019. That's almost twice the rate of business ownership than there is among millennials.  For some Canadians, retiring at age 65 isn't a reality, simply because of a lack of pension or savings. A 2018 survey by Sun Life Financial even found that a quarter of retired Canadians are still in debt in their golden years.  Canadians saving less  Some future retirees may continue to be short on savings, as Statistics Canada data shows that the household savings rate has fallen from a high of 21.6 per cent of net disposable income in 1982, to 1.7 per cent in the second quarter of 2019.  Lower interest rates could be one of the reasons for saving less, according to BMO Capital Markets economist Robert Kavcic, because the returns on savings are smaller and borrowing at low rates is tempting.  ""I think everybody that's investing now for retirement needs to be ratcheting down their return expectations and what a balanced portfolio is going to give you going forward over the next 10, 15, or 20 years"" said Kavcic.      Why Canadians find saving so hard — and how to get better at it   Even in an 'affordable' Canadian city, cost-of-living squeeze has people putting pressure on politicians    Bill VanGorder, who's 76, knew he would need to rely on his savings for retirement, as he worked for charities and not-for-profits throughout his life and didn't have a guaranteed pension. However, he says the 2008 financial crisis wiped out about half of his savings.  ""It's never really recovered for those of us who were invested at that time,"" said VanGorder.  Fortunately, VanGorder is able to supplement his savings with a company he started to sell and distribute Nordic walking poles in Atlantic Canada, as well as teach lessons.   ""The extra income is not only helpful but necessary,"" said VanGorder, owner of Nordic Walking Nova Scotia.    VanGorder also enjoys the challenges involved with learning new skills, such as online marketing and sales.  ""If you had told me 20 years ago that somebody of my age would be running an online business and doing so much social networking sales as we do, well, I wouldn't have known what you were talking about actually,"" laughed VanGorder.  Staying active and relevant is why 65-year-old Tom Gibson took part in Ramdahani's entrepreneur program for seniors in Oshawa.   Gibson wanted help as he and his two sons developed a business to sell portable safes.  Their HavlarGo safes would provide athletes, parents, and others on the go with a way to secure their valuables if they need to leave them unattended. For example, a baseball player could put their phone and wallet in the small safe, and use the tether to secure it to the bench or dugout while they play.    ""I always had that kind of entrepreneurial flair, but I never really had the opportunity. I could see that my sons had it in them as well, and I thought it was a flame that should be nurtured — let's not ignore this,"" said Gibson, while at the studio of Toronto firm West&amp;SOCIAL, the production company creating a product video for Havlar's upcoming crowdfunding campaign.  Gibson has no plans to retire anytime soon, even though he has a small pension from previous jobs. He is also still working full-time as a business consultant, which helps him contribute to funding the new family business.  ""It's about staying engaged. It's about being creative. It's about working with family and friends to do something that hasn't been done before,"" said Gibson.  Funding gap for senior entrepreneurs  Through the first round of the seniors' entrepreneur program, Ramdahani found a massive hole in terms of funding to support the senior entrepreneurs, including limited grants and loans for their businesses.   ""There is zero support,"" said Ramdahani.  She wants the next federal government to prioritize funding for seniors' entrepreneurial endeavours, and she hopes to secure other private funding as well to help her expand the SPICE program from 60 participants to 1,000 over three years.  ""They have been sitting on these ideas for about 30 to 40 years, so now is the time for them to unleash,"" said Ramdahani.",business

Derivatives are contracts that give a fixed price to hedge against volatility in the market.  It says declining crude prices led to the enormous losses.  The company fired the employee, which it did not name, on September 18 and lodged a criminal complaint.  Mitsubishi, considered a staid trading house typically not involved in high-risk transactions, says it has taken measures to tighten oversight.  The company is trying to determine if the Singapore incident will alter its financial forecast for the year.",business
61,Liberal Party confirms 3rd instance of Trudeau wearing blackface,"The Liberal Party has confirmed Justin Trudeau appeared in a short amateur video in blackface — a third instance of Trudeau appearing in racist makeup in the past — less than 12 hours after he admitted to wearing such makeup on just two occasions and acknowledged the actions were ""racist.""  The confirmation comes after Time Magazine dropped a bombshell story on Wednesday night featuring a 2001 photo of Trudeau in brownface and a turban, taken at a gala at a private school where Trudeau taught 18 years ago.    When asked about the incident Wednesday night, Trudeau also admitted to a second instance of racist behaviour. ""When I was in high school I dressed up at a talent show and sang Day-O with makeup on,"" he said.  This morning, the party confirmed a third instance of Trudeau being filmed in racist makeup, as first reported by Global News.    It's not clear where the video was taken. It appears to show Trudeau with his face and arms covered in black makeup, raising his hands in the air while laughing and sticking out his tongue.  ""We can confirm that it is him and it's from the early 1990s,"" said a Liberal Party spokesperson in a statement.    Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer later confirmed the video had been sent to his team originally, which then passed it on to Global for ""verification.""  A Liberal source says Trudeau held a conference call with his candidates Thursday morning to apologize. He will address the media at 2:15 p.m. ET in Winnipeg before flying to Saskatoon.  The photos have disrupted the Liberals' campaign plans. Until now, Trudeau has had morning events on every day of the federal election campaign.  For the first time during the campaign, Trudeau and his team stayed at a different hotel than members of the media Wednesday night.  Speaking to reporters on his campaign plane Wednesday night in Nova Scotia, Trudeau apologized for his actions, saying he now recognizes they were racist.  ""I shouldn't have done that. I should have known better, but I didn't and I'm really sorry,"" he said. ""I take responsibility for my decision to do that. I shouldn't have done it. I should have known better.  ""It was something that I didn't think was racist at the time, but now I recognize it was something racist to do and I am deeply sorry.""  Trudeau's apology based on 'a lie': Scheer  The story dominated the other leaders' campaign events today.   Scheer said the emergence of the video shows Trudeau's Wednesday night apology was based on ""a lie.""  ""I believe Canadians might have been able to accept his apology if he had been truthful and open, if he hadn't based that apology on a lie,"" Scheer said during a stop in Saint-Hyacinthe, Que.    ""He was specifically asked if there were other instances where he engaged in that type of racist behaviour and he indicated there was only one other instance. Now we know there [were] at least three.""  Asked today if he's ever dressed in any way that would be deemed offensive, Scheer said he has not.  ""I'm not perfect and I don't claim to be a saint, but nothing would come up to that level,"" he said.  During an interview with John Moore, host of Newstalk 1010 in Toronto, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh was asked if he'll smile and shake Trudeau's hand at the first leaders' debate.  ""It's going to be tough,"" he said. ""To be honest with you, I don't really know how to react. This is someone who so casually mocked the reality for so many people and has hurt a lot of Canadians with this.""

235,"Writer and conservationist Graeme Gibson, partner of Margaret Atwood, dead at 85","Graeme Gibson, the Canadian author, conservationist and longtime champion of writers' rights, has died at age 85.  Margaret Atwood, Gibson's longtime partner, said in a statement Wednesday issued by publisher Penguin Random House Canada: ""We are devastated by the loss of Graeme, our beloved father, grandfather and spouse, but we are happy that he achieved the kind of swift exit he wanted and avoided the decline into further dementia that he feared.  ""He had a lovely last few weeks, and he went out on a high, surrounded by love, friendship and appreciation. We are grateful for his wise, ethical and committed life.""  Gibson died Wednesday in London, England, where he had accompanied Atwood for the global release of her latest book.  Earlier this week, Atwood cancelled promotional appearances in Ottawa and Montreal for The Testaments — a sequel to her dystopian classic The Handmaid's Tale and one of this fall's most anticipated literary releases. The cancellation cited illness in the family.   A cover story in Time magazine earlier this month noted that Gibson was ""living with dementia,"" and that Atwood juggled caring for him while working on her new novel. In a 2017 piece in The Walrus about the couple's love of birdwatching, Gibson confirmed he had been diagnosed with dementia.    Born in London, Ont., in August 1934, Gibson penned novels (Five Legs, Communion, Perpetual Motion and Gentleman Death) as well as non-fiction, including Eleven Canadian Novelists (for which he interviewed his future partner Atwood), The Bedside Book of Birds and The Bedside Book of Beasts.    ""We are deeply saddened by the death of such a beloved and distinguished author. Graeme was a friend to several generations of Canadian writers,"" Penguin Random House Canada CEO Kristin Cochrane said in a statement.  She hailed Gibson as ""a true gentleman, whose gracious, elegant and witty manner touched all who knew him.""    He was also an activist for different causes.  Gibson was a founding member of both the Writers' Union of Canada and the Writers' Trust of Canada, as well as a past president of PEN Canada. He was an advocate for conservation efforts and a devoted birder who helped found the Pelee Island Bird Observatory.  Gibson was invested as a member of the Order of Canada in 1992.  Along with Atwood, he's survived by, among others, their daughter Eleanor Jess, sons Matt and Grae from his previous marriage to publisher Shirley Gibson, and grandchildren.",entertainment
122,Yada yada yada: Netflix to air Seinfeld starting in 2021,"Netflix says it will start streaming all 180 episodes of Seinfeld in 2021, gaining a hugely popular addition to its library as the battle for viewers heats up.  Netflix Inc. struck the deal with Sony Pictures Television for the global streaming rights to the Emmy-winning television comedy, which aired its final episode in 1998.    Terms were not released.  Netflix is also the home of Jerry Seinfeld's talk series Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee.    The deal for Seinfeld comes after Netflix announced in June that it would be losing its most popular TV show, The Office.   Netflix will still carry the show for more than a year, but NBC isn't extending the licence further with NBCUniversal's streaming service launching in 2020.    Netflix will face even more competition in November, when Apple and Disney launch their own streaming services within days of each other.",entertainment
206,N.S. bird watchers shocked by 'staggering' bird declines,"Bird watchers in Nova Scotia say they are shocked but not entirely surprised by the findings in a recent report that estimates there are nearly three billion fewer birds in Canada and the United States than there were half a century ago.  The report published Thursday in the journal Science counted a loss of 2.9 billion birds compared with 1970, which represents a population decline of 29 per cent and an ""overlooked biodiversity crisis.""  ""This has been something that has been talked about for many years,"" said Lucas Berrigan, who works for Bird Studies Canada.  ""We've been sort of peripherally aware of it, [it's] just never been summarized in this way before.""  The study was co-authored by Environment Canada and Climate Change Canada, along with five United States agencies. It combined population data from more than 500 species going back half a century.    Its findings reflect what's happening in the Maritimes, said Berrigan.  ""This is not just North America,"" he said. ""There is a global crisis and I think we need to... take this more seriously than we have previously.""    While Bird Studies Canada does not have the same kind of statistics, it is monitoring certain populations, such as aerial insectivores and seabirds like Leach's storm petrel.  ""Barn swallows, chimney swifts and nighthawks, as well as seabirds, storm petrels in particular, these are birds that are usually out of sight of most people, but they are of a significant importance ecologically,"" Berrigan said.  ""We've seen quite large declines in those populations. The largest population of one of these seabirds has declined nearly 50 per cent in the past 35 years.""  Others impacted include backyard birds, warblers, finches, sparrows and songbirds, as well as long distance birds like swallows and sandpipers that come to Canada from the Arctic.  Berrigan noted that another recently published paper spoke about how neonicotinoid — a pesticide — is affecting bird migration.  ""In short, they lose a significant amount of body fat when feeding on seeds treated with very small amounts of [neonicotinoids],"" he said.  ""Body fat is extremely important for migratory birds since it determines how far they can fly at a given time.""    Andrew Holland, a spokesperson for the Nature Conservancy of Canada, said birds are important for many reasons and everyone should care about their decline.  ""It's staggering really,"" Holland said of the study's findings.    ""When you look at those numbers, clearly it's a signal that there needs to be more conservation of lands that protect the habitats for the birds that are remaining so that they have a fighting chance of bouncing back.""  Habitat loss and climate change are among the major factors impacting the decline of bird populations.    Free-roaming domestic cats, collisions with glass, pesticide use and a decline in insects are also factors, he said.  Holland suggested that people leave their cats indoors.  ""A lot of lands have been lost — wetlands, forests, coastal shoreline areas have been lost to erosion, storm surges, development and subdivisions,"" said Holland.  ""So what's happened is these birds have been displaced and they've lost their traditional habitat and they've had difficulty relocating.""",technology
188,Why tech giants are creating apps for people with disabilities,"Tech companies like Google are stepping up efforts to create products for people living with disabilities as a way to make them more accessible and to boost business.   Part of that effort is developing apps designed to facilitate communication between hearing and non-hearing people.   ""We have technology and capabilities, particularly in the realm of machine learning and AI that we can apply,"" said Brian Kemler, product manager of accessibility for Google.   In February, Google rolled out Live Transcribe, an app that does literally that—transcribing speech in almost real-time while detecting ambient sound like vehicles and specific types of music. It can also transcribe dozens of languages.   Noisy environments  ""It's really convenient,"" said Anya Karir, a Toronto woman who is deaf. Karir has a cochlear implant, so she doesn't use the app every day. She said it helps her in noisy environments, like on a recent trip to New York where she was on a tour and couldn't hear what the guide was saying.   ""I pulled out the phone, connected to the WiFi and I was able to read what he was saying,"" she said.   She also said it's useful in everyday situations, like coffee shops where there is often noise from the machines as well as other conversations happening around her.     Tech giants getting into the business of making their products and services more accessible is a plus for Derek Rumball, president of the Bob Rumball Canadian Centre of Excellence for the Deaf.   ""Everyone is always inventing a new mouse trap,"" he said. ""Anytime technology helps me understand a deaf person and, more importantly, helps them be understood, helps level the playing field.""   Good for business  Levelling that playing field isn't just the socially responsible thing to do, argues tech expert Takara Small, who founded a not-for-profit helping kids from underserved communities learn about coding and entrepreneurship.   Small said there are dozens of apps out there, developed by startups and big tech companies that do everything from amplifying sound to mapping out which buildings are wheelchair accessible.   She's especially noticing tech companies like Facebook and Microsoft taking a leadership role in the field.   ""It's just the right thing to do to make products anyone, anywhere can use,"" she said.   But the approach also benefits the bottom line. In April, the World Bank estimated a billion people, or 15 per cent of the world's population, experience some form of disability.   ""Technology is so crucial to everything we do so creating products that allow everyone to participate is a financially smart move,"" she said.",health
137,"Leaders talk financial relief, but Trudeau still quizzed over blackface scandal","Days after the blackface scandal rocked the election campaign, the federal party leaders on Sunday appeared to be looking to move on, rolling out policies they said would put more money in people's pockets.  But Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau, despite two major policy announcements, was again peppered with questions from reporters about the controversial images.    Policies dealing with financial relief,  cost-of-living, or so-called ""pocketbook"" issues have been a common thread throughout the campaign. All leaders have talked about making life easier for families. And little wonder — a survey conducted by CBC News found that that issue was the greatest concern for Canadians heading into this election.  Plans to make life financially easier  Just this week, before the revelations of the brownface and blackface images became international news, the Conservatives, Liberals, NDP and Greens had brought forward proposals, which they claim, would make life financially easier for Canadians.  NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh promised free dental care for households making under $70,000. Trudeau promised a boost to the Canada Child Benefit (CCB) for babies, and a 15-week leave program for adoptive parents. Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said a Tory government would resurrect a policy of the former Conservative government — tax credits for expenses related to children fitness, sports activities and arts and learning.     Meanwhile, Green Party Elizabeth May, who unveiled her full party platform, promised a Green government would limit credit card interest rates and ATM fees.  And on Sunday, both Singh and Scheer were offering more financial help for some voters. In  Canoe Cove, P.E.I., Scheer focused on veterans, promising to help them financially by dealing with the backlog of veterans' benefits applications within two years. Meanwhile, Singh, in Gatineau, Que., promised to add $2.5 billion to the federal government's disaster mitigation fund, money he wants used to build infrastructure that would help protect homes and businesses from floods.  But it was Trudeau who came out on Sunday in Brampton, Ont. with policies hoping to appeal to a wide range of middle-class families — cuts to income taxes and cellphone bills.  Won't pay taxes on first $15,000  He said a Liberal government, if re-elected, would raise the basic personal income tax deduction to $15,000 from the present $12,069 for people earning less than $147,000. That means they would pay no income tax on that first $15,000.   This, he said, would save the average taxpayer $292 every year, while an average family would get $585.     While the NDP and Greens, have instead, focused on raising taxes on corporations, it's the Conservatives and Liberals who have been battling for title of best tax cuts.  Just a week ago, Scheer announced his own tax savings plan, which he said would cut the rate on the lowest income tax bracket to 13.75 per cent from 15 per cent.   Based on the party's calculations, the average single taxpayer would save about $444 a year. A two-income couple earning an average salary would save about $850 a year.    But Trudeau unveiled another pledge on Sunday, one that seemed to target the NDP.  He zoomed in on an expense Canadians love to complain about — cellphone bills. With Canadians reportedly paying some of the highest cellphone costs in the G7,  Trudeau announced that if re-elected, his government would cut those bills by 25 per cent over the next two years. That, he said, would save the average family of four up to $976 a year.  The Liberals' proposal took aim at the NDP's plan, which would implement price caps on cellphone and internet bills.  Questions about blackface scandal  Asked how exactly Trudeau, would cut those costs without regulation, the Liberal leader would only say that his government would ""engage"" with the telecom companies, and that they would face ""further competition"" if they were unable to achieve those price decreases.    But he was also questioned about the brownface and blackface scandal. Asked by a Reuters reporter just how short-lived the controversy may be, Trudeau suggested that Canadians are more concerned about affordability issues and two of the biggest are taxes and cell phone costs.  Yet he was still asked specific questions about the scandal: Could he say he hasn't worn blackface since 2001? Did he first realize blackface was racist in 2008? Was he reaching out to anybody who might help jog his memory regarding the number of times he has worn blackface?  But he seemed to take all those questions in stride, giving no specifics, instead, saying he has been forthright on this issue, that he will continue to stand against racism, that he was deeply embarrassed but takes responsibility for his actions.",politics
12,"Alberta's 'Gas City' to shut down 2,000 wells, laying off up to 100 people","The southern Alberta community of Medicine Hat — known as ""The Gas City"" — is permanently shuttering 2,000 of its active natural gas wells due to extremely low prices, resulting in layoffs for about 100 people.  The decision to close 75 per cent of the city's wells was announced last Wednesday and formalized Monday evening. Medicine Hat Mayor Ted Clugston said the difficult choice was a long time in the making.  ""This didn't happen overnight,"" Clugston said on the Calgary Eyeopener.  ""We've been actually talking about a strategy going forward for 10 years now since I've been on city council, when the prices basically went into the tank in 2008-2009.""  Clugston said that the continual plunge in natural gas prices has caused the city to lose money at the rate of $30-35 million a year.    ""There have been points in time that we're actually paying people to take our gas,"" said Clugston.  About 500 of the city's oldest wells, called ""100-year wells,"" in the city's north side will remain active, as they cost the least to keep running.     ""We will still have to keep some employees on to maintain those, but everything in Saskatchewan and to the east of us is going to be shut in eventually,"" said Clugston.  The closures will result in about 100 workers losing their jobs.  ""We've really never, ever laid anybody off … it's a tough thing to do,"" said Clugston.  ""It's not something we want to do. We'll try to accommodate as many as we can, but I think most of them realize that this day was coming.""  Identity crisis  Job and industry losses are a hard legacy to grapple with as a city and as mayor, said Clugston.  ""I didn't want to be the mayor in 120 years that took Medicine Hat somewhat out of the gas business. I mean, that's not a legacy that anybody would want to leave in this municipality,"" said Clugston.  Clugston said the people of Medicine Hat are generally supportive of the decisions he and the city council made.      The silver lining on cheap natural gas is that anybody who burns it to … value add is doing well.  - Ted Clugston, mayor of Medicine Hat     ""But my citizens … they're not happy about it but they recognize that tough business decisions have to be made.""  He said that despite these losses, Medicine Hat's identity will still be tied to the oil and gas industry.  ""We take great pride in our history of natural gas production as a municipality and everything that it's given to us all,"" said Clugston.  ""All of our recreation facilities are paid for, and our property taxes are subsidized by the natural gas profits, and all of our industry here burns natural gas to make fertilizer or fuel or methanol — now we're even using it to make bitcoin.""  Silver lining  After the wells close, Clugston said they plan on leaving them that way, ""unless a miracle happens,"" as re-drilling would be costly.  ""The goal is to cap them and take the equipment off and to reclaim the land to its original, whatever it was, if it was grass for cattle or whatever,"" said Clugston.  The closing of so many natural gas wells in a city nicknamed for its oil and gas history signals a shift in industry for the population of 60,000 people.  However, Clugston said natural gas still powers the city's future.    ""The silver lining on cheap natural gas is that anybody who burns it to … value add is doing well,"" said Clugston.   He cited Medicine Hat's methanol plant, the Goodyear tire plant, bitcoin mining ⁠— which uses electricity generated from natural gas ⁠— and the future Aurora Cannabis greenhouse.  ""That's all based on low-cost natural gas,"" said Clugston.  ""We're still very proud of that and we will keep The Gas City we are.""    With files from the Calgary Eyeopener.",business
226,Antigone chosen as Canada's Oscars contender for best international film,"Quebec writer-director Sophie Deraspe says she's proud that her film has been chosen as the ""Canadian ambassador"" in the lead-up to the 2020 Academy Awards.  Telefilm Canada announced Friday that Canada is putting forward Antigone to vie for a nomination in the Oscars' best international feature film category, previously known as best foreign language film.  Deraspe said she sees the recognition not only as an endorsement of her craft, but also of the ideal the film espouses.  ""Antigone is also a film about values — values of sympathy, integrity, love,"" the Montreal filmmaker said by phone after Friday's announcement.  ""I feel proud of ... campaigning not only for film, for the art of filmmaking, but also those values.""  A modern take on Sophocles' Greek tragedy, the drama, set in Montreal, centres on Antigone, played by newcomer Nahéma Ricci — a teenager caught in a clash between her moral code and Canada's justice system when tragedy strikes her immigrant family.  Deraspe, who wrote and directed the film, said the story represents the power of the individual to shatter the ""immovable wall"" of the system.  ""It's about a young woman who has no power in terms of what power is in our world ... and she stands against authority because of what she believes,"" said Deraspe, whose credits include the 2015 documentary The Amina Profile and the feature Les Loups.  ""That's what the film wants to carry — that OK, there's this big system above us, but we are those that are powerful deep inside.""  Antigone won the $30,000 Canada Goose Award for best Canadian feature film at the Toronto International Film Festival last Sunday.  Since then, Deraspe said she's been fielding calls from American film agents offering to help her break into Hollywood.  While she's interested in the opportunity to expand her cinematic reach, the 45-year-old said moving to Los Angeles wasn't really her ""dream.""  ""We live in a country that supports art and filmmaking ... that supports auteur filmmaking, not only commercial voices,"" she said.  ""We can bring out something to an audience that resonates more than just for fun or adventure, and in that way, yes, I'm proud of my country, and I'm proud of being the ambassador.""  Antigone, which hits theatres in Quebec on Nov. 6, is competing against films submitted by dozens of other countries, including two Canadian co-productions, in the race for an Oscars' nod for international feature.  A short list of 10 films will be unveiled on Dec. 16, and the chosen five official nominees will be announced on Jan.13.

7,Conservatives say they're ditching the traditional rally in favour of the door-knock,"Andrew Scheer's people say they're not troubled by the modest turnout of supporters at some of the Conservative leader's public campaign events. In fact, they say it's all part of the strategy.  While that might sound counterintuitive, a senior Conservative source said the campaign would rather see its volunteers out knocking on doors and handing out lawn signs instead of spending time and energy on organizing traditional rallies where supporters are used as a ""human backdrop.""  Scheer was asked about his crowd sizes on Tuesday during a news conference in Winnipeg, a day after an enthusiastic but small group of around 200 people showed up to watch Scheer's stump speech in Calgary.  Given the overwhelming support for the Conservative Party in Alberta, the deep sense of frustration there with Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau and the continued popularity of United Conservative Party Premier Jason Kenney, the crowd in Calgary seemed surprisingly small.  On day one of the campaign, about 500 people attended an evening rally for Scheer in the Greater Toronto Area riding of Woodbridge-Vaughan. About 350 people attended a Scheer rally at a community centre gym in Parksville, British Columbia on Vancouver Island on Sunday.  Trudeau is drawing much larger audiences so far. CBC News reporters covering the Liberal leader's tour say that on the first day of the campaign in Vancouver, around 1,300 attended a Trudeau rally there. On the third day, more than 1,200 people showed up for an event with Trudeau in Montreal.    ""We actually specifically tell people, 'You know, the best thing you can do to help form a Conservative government is hit those doors, get those brochures out,'"" Scheer said on Tuesday.  ""We specifically ask other campaigns to keep their volunteers on the ground knocking doors as much as possible ... I'm actually very pleased with the turnout.""  Ground game favoured  The Conservative source acknowledged the party's strategy is untested — and it won't know whether it worked until the votes are counted.  But the source expressed confidence that volunteer energy is better spent on the ground game than on rallies.  The source said the party is working to reshape its volunteer culture, and building up the ground game is a big part of that effort.  Scheer will do some rallies in larger Canadian cities closer to voting day. But these events are not expected to be the primary focus for the Conservative team.",politics

The Toronto beef slaughter and processing plant, which also does business as Tri-Pet Holdings Inc., was suspended as of September 17, 2019 for ""non-compliances related to control measures.""  ""Because this matter is under investigation, we do not have more information to share at this time,"" reads a statement to CBC News from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA).  ""The licence to operate was suspended because the operator failed to meet regulatory requirements as required (under) the Safe Food for Canadians Regulations. The company failed to implement effective control measures to ensure that activities conducted would result in a product that is safe for consumption.""  CFIA did not immediately provide more details but said there are currently no recalls associated with the licence suspension as CFIA conducts the food safety investigation.  If products are recalled, the public will be notified through CFIA's website.    Ryding-Regency did not respond to an email inquiry from CBC and the telephone number listed on its website is not in service.  According to its website, Ryding-Regency Meat Packers has been in operation since 1983 and is focused ""on producing the highest quality grain fed beef and veal products that Canada has to offer.""  ""Ryding-Regency is proud to be a family legacy spanning over two generations dedicated to master butchery,"" its website reads.  According to CFIA, the licence suspension will be lifted if the agency concludes that required corrective measures have been taken.

13,Canopy Growth to hire new CEO by end of year: chairman,"Canopy Growth Corp.'s chairman says it expects to complete its search for a new chief executive officer by the end of the calendar year.  John Bell adds that the ""robust"" search is already underway with a number of ""well-seasoned"" candidates.  Bell's comments came at the cannabis company's annual shareholder meeting in Toronto today, the first to be held since its co-founder Bruce Linton was terminated from his role as co-CEO in July after its biggest shareholder Constellation Brands said it was disappointed in its latest earnings.  Its current chief executive Mark Zekulin, who had previously been co-CEO alongside Linton, has said he would stay on until a suitable replacement was found.    Zekulin told shareholders at the meeting that it was his choice to leave, and it was a ""natural progression"" for new leadership to drive things forward.  Meanwhile, Linton on Tuesday announced his next moves, which include advisory roles in three companies including U.S.-based dispensary company Gage Cannabis Co. and Australia-based Mind Medicine Inc., which is focused on psychedelic-assisted medicines.",business
93,CDC activates emergency operations centre for vaping-related illnesses,"The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Monday it has activated its emergency operations centre to coordinate the investigation into hundreds of cases of severe lung illnesses linked to e-cigarette use.  The CDC's Emergency Operations Center offers a central command post where teams of trained disease experts track public health emergencies, share information and coordinate the responses.  ""CDC has made it a priority to find out what is causing this outbreak of e-cigarette or vaping-related injuries and deaths,"" CDC Director Robert Redfield said in a statement.  Recent emergencies in which the CDC activated the Emergency Operations Center include Hurricane Florence in 2018, hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria in 2017, and the Zika outbreak and the Flint, Michigan, water contamination crisis in 2016.  So far, the CDC has confirmed six deaths and is investigating 380 confirmed or probable cases of the vaping-related illness in 36 states and plus the U.S. Virgin Islands, the agency said last week.    While the cases have not yet been linked to a specific product or ingredient, health officials have urged consumers to quit vaping altogether.  For those who continue, the CDC urges consumers to avoid buying vaping products on the street, using marijuana-derived oil with the products or modifying a store-bought vape product.  Anyone who has breathing problems after vaping, such as a dry, or unproductive, cough; shortness of breath and chest pain that worsens with deep breathing, should report them to their doctor.",health
95,Filling 'prescriptions' for fruit and veggies blowing food bank's budget,"An Ottawa food bank that accepts ""prescriptions"" for fresh produce is struggling to keep up as more and more people come from across the city looking for fruit and vegetables.  About five years ago, the Parkdale Food Centre in Hintonburg began accepting clients from outside its catchment area, provided they have a written note for nutritious food from their doctor or social worker.   It's part of a growing ""social prescription"" movement to promote healthy eating, exercise and even social interaction.     Why doctors are prescribing bingo, not pills, to keep patients healthy   Why U.K. doctors are doling out 'social prescriptions' to treat mental health    Karen Secord, executive director of the Parkdale Food Centre, said since the food bank began accepting the prescriptions, she's seen its monthly food budget nearly double from $12,000 to $22,000.    ""Right now, about 55 per cent of the people who are coming here are coming here with prescriptions for healthy food,"" Secord said.  ""They're coming from across the city with a prescription from their doctors saying, my patient has a low income, has diabetes or hypertension or whatever other reason, and requires healthy food.""  Fresh produce  Secord said the food bank, located within the Somerset West Community Health Centre, strives to offer only healthy food, including unlimited fruit and vegetables.  Agnes Nakitende and her family came to Canada from Uganda about six months ago. When they arrived, she said her children started developing food allergies and her husband was diagnosed with diabetes.    Nakitende said the processed food readily available here was partly to blame.  ""When we visited our dietitian he advised us that we need to look into our menu. It meant that now we needed to have more of the veggies, we needed to have more of the fruits, which we could not afford to buy in the stores,"" Nakitende said.  She said her dietitian then directed them toward the Parkdale Food Centre. Armed with a prescription, the family was welcomed with open arms even though they live in another part of town.    'Like angels to me'  Idayat Olugbade was in a similar situation after moving to Ottawa from Nigeria with her three children. She buses about 45 minutes from their shelter in the east end to get to the Parkdale Food Centre.  Olugbade recalls the first time she arrived home with the fresh produce  ""When my children saw it they all cried. I cried, because that's my first time of someone helping me as much as that,"" Olugbade said. ""They're just amazing people here. I don't know where they come from, they're just like angels to me.""    Dr. Laura Muldoon, a family physician in the Somerset West Community Health Centre, said the idea of social prescriptions is spreading within the medical community.   Muldoon said she directs patients to the Parkdale food bank because she knows they have fresh produce, and she knows they accept prescriptions.  ""I haven't ever actually directed anyone to a different food bank to see if that would work,"" Muldoon said.    For the Parkdale Food Centre, though, its reputation as the go-to spot for nutritious food has come at a cost. Secord said when she decided to start accepting the prescriptions, it was partly to prove a point.  ""What I'm trying to do is to show that when people do not have access to healthy food, we indeed have a public health crisis,"" Secord said.  The food bank is now joining with eight other organizations to try to create distribution hubs across the city where people will eventually be able to get fresh food closer to home.",health
134,"Impact of blackface scandal unclear now, may not be revealed until ballots are cast","When a scandal erupts in the middle of an election campaign, there's a natural tendency to want to see what impact it will have on the vote — and often a rush to draw sweeping conclusions from the morsels of data that trickle out in the early days.  The revelations that Justin Trudeau wore blackface on multiple occasions before entering politics is one of those scandals, though it is perhaps without parallel in Canadian political history.  While it raises broader questions about racism in Canada, in the midst of an election campaign it will inescapably also be one of several factors Canadians will be considering when they cast their ballots.  It's too early to say what effect the scandal has had on voting intentions. The first sets of polling data captured entirely after Time magazine published on Wednesday photos of Trudeau wearing blackface at a school fundraiser in 2001 gave conflicting results.  A Nanos Research poll conducted Sept. 19 to 21 found the Liberals trailing the Conservatives by nearly three percentage points nationwide. But in a poll conducted between Sept. 15 and 17, the gap was about two points. Both the Conservatives and Liberals saw a drop in support and all of it within the margin of error.  Forum Research, also in the field between Sept. 19 and 21, found the Conservatives and Liberals tied at 33 per cent apiece. In a Sept. 11 poll, Forum had put the Conservatives ahead by four points. Liberal support actually increased by one point.  So the trend lines are heading in different directions. That could mean there has been no significant impact, but it mostly suggests that more data is needed before conclusions can be drawn. That is about as clear as it gets right now.  Whatever common threads can be pulled from the polls in the coming days, it is the longer-term repercussions that will decide which party will win the election. How voters initially react to a scandal is not always reflective of what they will think about it weeks later.  The more scandal-plagued world of American politics provides a few examples of that.  Not all scandals are politically fatal  On Oct. 7, 2016, the Washington Post published a video of then-candidate Donald Trump boasting about groping women. That day, the CBC's aggregation of presidential polls put Trump behind Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton by a margin of about 3.5 points nationwide.  His numbers tumbled in the subsequent days, with his support dropping by about two points and the gap between him and Clinton increasing to about 7.5 points.  But the impact of the scandal didn't last — by Oct. 27, Trump was back up to 43 per cent support and by Oct. 29 he had pulled to within three points of Clinton. Events, such as two presidential debates and the news that the FBI was investigating emails on Clinton's private server, intervened.  Some scandals can be survived. Gennifer Flowers' testimony in January 1992 that she had an extramarital affair with Bill Clinton did not prevent Clinton from winning the Democratic nomination and the presidency later that year.  But other personal scandals can end a political career. Gary Hart was the frontrunner for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination until rumours of marital infidelity undermined his bid and he eventually withdrew from the primaries. Polls initially suggested little impact on Hart's support, but his credibility had been fatally wounded.  Trudeau already vulnerable on trust  That is the risk for the Liberal leader, regardless of what the polls show over the coming days. Lots of time remains for Trudeau to put the story behind him and focus voters on other issues — there will be three debates between now and election day, which is still four weeks away.  In 2015, Trudeau was able to use the lengthy election campaign to defy his opponents' attacks. Conservative ads said that Trudeau was ""just not ready"", but good performances in the debates helped Trudeau to show voters that was not the case. The attacks no longer resonated because voters didn't believe them.  The Conservatives are now casting Trudeau as ""not as advertised"", while the New Democrats and Greens have tried to paint Trudeau as a false progressive who can't be trusted. After last week, that has all the more potential to resonate.  An Angus Reid Institute poll conducted before last Wednesday suggested that just six per cent of uncommitted voters (those most coveted by all parties) thought Trudeau was racist, while 94 per cent said he was tolerant. The scandal is unlikely to hurt Trudeau on this question, as it doesn't feed into any preconceived notions Canadians have about him — in fact, quite the opposite.  But between being honest or a liar, a slim majority in this poll described him as the latter. Before last week, many Canadians already believed that Trudeau is untrustworthy. Those opposition attacks are now pushing on an open door.  Still, the early numbers are unclear as to whether the scandal has pushed voters away from the Liberals in any big way. It's possible that it won't or that Trudeau will be able to recover if they do. There's lots of campaigning still to go.  But the data gathered before the scandal broke suggested that Trudeau had a vulnerability in this campaign when it came to voters' trust. Whether or not the numbers move in the coming days, the blackface scandal has only amplified that weakness — with consequences that might not become clear for some time yet.

136,"Jagmeet Singh appears on top Quebec talk show, says he shares Quebecers' values","NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh appeared on Quebec's flagship talk show, Tout le monde en parle, Sunday night, saying he shares Quebecers' values on issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage.  Host Guy Lepage asked Singh his take on the province's new religious symbols law, climate change, People's Party Leader Maxime Bernier and the recent scandal involving Justin Trudeau in blackface.   ""I share the same values as Quebecers,"" Singh said. ""I'm for abortion, for same-sex marriage.""  He described himself as ""someone who fell in love with the French language in an English city. I want to be an ally and I will be an ally for Quebec.""  Lepage pointed out Singh is the first racialized person to lead a federal party in Canada and asked his perspective on the Trudeau blackface photos.   ""I've fought against racism with my hands,"" Singh said. ""Not everyone is able to fight back.""  He said Trudeau's decision to wear blackface was bad judgment.   ""For many people it brings up memories of things that happened in their lives,"" Singh said.     When asked about the law formerly known as Bill 21, which would prevent public employees from wearing religious symbols — such as Singh's turban — at work, the NDP leader assured Lepage he's aware of Quebec's ""competence"" in that file, but that he's against laws that divide the population.  ""I think the job of a politician is to find ways to bring people together,"" Singh said.  However, he said an NDP government would not join legal challenges to the law.     Singh repeated that he doesn't think Bernier should take part in the televised leaders debates.  He said it was a difficult decision to make, since he believes in free expression. But Bernier goes too far.    ""There's a moment that it jumps from exchange of ideas to promotion of hateful and divisive ideas that increase tensions,"" Singh said. ""We must not give a platform to a person who divides the population.""   In regard to the environment, Singh said his party has several proposals ideas to create jobs while reducing emissions, such as ecological renovations for buildings.   He said it was a bad decision for the Liberal government to purchase the Trans Mountain Pipeline and that an NDP government would not go ahead with its expansion.  After the Orange Crush  Singh wants to at least hold his party's Quebec seats. NDP support has slumped since Jack Layton's Orange Crush in 2011, when the party took 59 of the province's 78 seats.  CBC's poll tracker suggests the party has, on average, only 8.8 per cent of the vote in the province, while the Greens had 8.7 per cent as of Sunday evening.   Tout le monde en parle, a highly popular weekly talk show, has become a key campaign stop for politicians seeking to sway the province's francophones.   The NDP platform for the province promises more powers on portfolios including the environment, language, immigration and justice.   Singh says he wants his party to be ""an ally to Quebec and the French language.""",politics

106,Barely trained observers hired to monitor wildlife impacts of offshore oil exploration ,"Wildlife observers with little to no experience — and no background in biology — are being deployed to monitor the environmental impact of oil exploration off the coast of Newfoundland, as companies hunt for new fields to develop in the multibillion-dollar industry.  Three seasoned observers, all with at least a decade of field experience, said they've recently worked alongside novice staff with no experience beyond one or two four-day courses.  All the observers contacted by CBCu002FRadio-Canada said they recently saw novice observers regularly miss and misidentify species, and data collected by these inexperienced observers on the environmental impact of seismic activity may be compromised.  Observer courses offered by Edgewise Environmental include a single day of field training. There are no prerequisites to take the training.  Federal regulations require ""qualified"" observers ""trained to identity different species of marine mammals and turtles"" to be aboard seismic vessels surveying undersea oil and gas reserves.  But those same regulations leave the professional training, and background required to be considered a ""qualified"" marine observer, largely undefined.    ""Observers are one of three people on the boat who can shut down the seismic operations, which is a massive responsibility, and all they have is a four-day course? That doesn't add up to me,"" said Stephanie Leger, a biologist and wildlife observer with more than 10 years of experience.  ""Background is so, so important for every other job on the boat. You can't really work as an engineer without being an engineer.""  According to Fisheries and Oceans Canada regulations, marine observers must be present aboard vessels during all seismic surveying, a process whereby air guns produce sound waves that hit the ocean floor.  Before any seismic activity can begin, observers must ensure an exclusion zone surrounding the guns is free of any marine mammals or turtles. Once the surveying starts, they have the authority to call a temporary halt to all seismic activity if a threatened or endangered species is spotted.  Biology degrees not required  Job offers posted to LinkedIn earlier this year by recruitment agency Dovre noted that observers have the ""decision authority to delay or stop a multimillion-dollar seismic activity.""      The observations are being made from a moving platform of a ship that's rolling around in an extremely harsh environment.  - Ian Jones, faculty of biology, Memorial University     Offers posted by Dovre also showed that university-level biology certification is not required for the position, but said candidates needed experience identifying and observing marine life.  Dovre did not respond to emailed questions from CBCu002FRadio-Canada.  ""It takes years of experience to be able to collect this kind of information in a rigorous, quantitative manner,"" said biologist Ian Jones of Memorial University in St. John's.    ""The observations are being made from a moving platform of a ship that's rolling around in an extremely harsh environment. What is being observed is extremely difficult to observe, interpret and identify.""    Ashley Noseworthy, founder and president of Edgewise Environmental, said her courses were never designed to certify elite-level marine observers.  In the absence of any widely available, Newfoundland-specific training for observers — outside certain environmental companies' in-house training — Noseworthy said she hoped to create a standard course on observing marine life in the province's offshore.  ""The whole point of my business is to start building up that accreditation and the programs and giving people a basis to start with so that if they don't have that biology background they at least have something.""  Previously, many observers went abroad for training, taking courses set up according to the regulatory regimes of other countries.   Hole in regulations  In its guidelines on seismic work, the Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board (C-NLOPB), the province's offshore regulator, explains that designated observers ""trained in marine mammal and seabird observations"" must follow monitoring protocols set out by Fisheries and Oceans and the Canadian Wildlife Service.  Fisheries and Oceans directives for minimizing the impact of seismic activity on marine mammals do not require any specific training for offshore observers.  ""We do not oversee the training and experience of marine mammal observers,"" a department spokesperson said.      If you don't set out those standards. then you know, the industry is just going to say, ""OK, well, here are the rules and regulations.""  - Ashley Noseworthy, Edgewise Environmental     A statement from the Canadian Wildlife Service said the federal agency's protocol on seabird observers recommends they have theoretical and practical training, and they be taught by experienced observers.  However, the statement added the ""Canadian Wildlife Service does not oversee approvals of observers for seismic vessels or oil platforms regulated by the C-NLOPB.""  'There's nobody necessarily breaking the rules'  Noseworthy said the federal government should eliminate any vagueness in its regulations surrounding observer qualifications.  ""There's nobody necessarily breaking the rules, because everybody's following the (DFO) Statement of Canadian Practice. The C-NLOPB makes sure that, for example, the seismic industry is providing marine mammal and seabird observers. Qualifications and whatnot, well, what is 'qualified' is yet to be defined,"" Noseworthy said.  ""If you don't set out those standards. then you know, the industry is just going to say, 'OK, well, here are the rules and regulations.'... The Statement of Canadian Practice should be quite clear.""  International comparisons  In a 2012 position statement, the Marine Mammal Observer Association, an international organization of observers, argued a training certificate ""should not be the only requirement to qualify a person as an observer.""  The association said observers should have professional experience identifying and observing marine mammals, and collecting and assimilating data.  Other countries, notably New Zealand and Australia, have much stricter policies regarding wildlife observer qualifications.  In New Zealand, for instance, people looking to become marine observers must complete a government-certified training program. Afterward, candidates must shadow an experienced observer for at least 12 weeks before being deemed qualified.  Each week, observation data collected by wildlife observers aboard seismic ships must be reported to the C-NLOPB. A final report, including all work stoppages and delays due to marine mammal sightings, is also provided to the regulator once a surveying project is complete.  In a statement, the C-NLOPB said shutdowns due to marine mammal sightings have occurred ""a few times, typically for very short durations.""  Read more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador",technology
240,NBC's Peacock to join the streaming fray in April,"Comcast's NBCUniversal said Tuesday that its upcoming streaming service will be called Peacock, in an homage to NBC's logo.  It will become the home for some of the company's most popular shows, including Parks and Recreation and The Office. That means both will be leaving Netflix, although not for several months after Peacock launches.  As Disney, AT&amp;T's WarnerMedia and NBCUniversal prepare to debut their streaming services, they have been taking some of their TV and movie deals away from Netflix, the most popular streaming service. That augurs a future where consumers will have to hunt for their favourite shows and films among lots of different services.  WarnerMedia for example on Tuesday also announced that HBO Max, its upcoming streaming service, will have the U.S. rights to The Big Bang Theory. Netflix on Monday said it's adding Seinfeld.  Peacock, like HBO Max, is launching in April, after Disney Plus and Apple TV Plus, which come out this November. NBCUniversal on Tuesday did not announce a price. The service will have ads.    A spokesperson said there will be an international rollout ""down the road"" but did not provide further details.  Peacock's lineup will include series like 30 Rock, Will &amp; Grace and Cheers, although those won't stream exclusively on Peacock, as well as original new movies and shows.

57,B.C. man shown with Trudeau in brownface photo says he doesn't believe Liberal leader is racist ,"One of two men shown posing with Justin Trudeau in one of the infamous photos of the future prime minister wearing racist makeup says he wasn't offended then, and he isn't offended now.  Sunny Khurana's children were students at Vancouver's West Point Grey Academy in 2001, when the school held a fundraising gala with an ""Arabian Nights"" theme. Photos taken that night show Trudeau, then a teacher, smiling in brownface and a turban.  Khurana told host Gloria Macarenko on CBC's On The Coast he's heard the criticism that the costume was demeaning to people of colour, but it didn't register that way to him.  ""I don't recall anybody saying anything negative about it. I don't think the intention was to hurt anybody,"" said Khurana, owner of Guru Bazaar, a sari and fabric store in Surrey, B.C.  The first photo of Trudeau at the gala emerged Wednesday afternoon, and it was followed soon after by two confirmed instances of Trudeau wearing blackface, along with a second photo from the gala, featuring Khurana.    The images have thrown a giant wrench in the Liberal Party's election campaign, as Trudeau faces questions on his true feelings about people of colour. Experts say there is a long history in North America of white people wearing blackface or dark makeup to mock and belittle other cultures.  The Liberal leader has apologized, but he has not been able to say whether there might be more photos to come.    But Khurana said he doesn't see the big deal.  ""The main thing is that Justin Trudeau, as prime minister, never came across as somebody who had racist tendencies,"" said Khurana    Other parents who attended the event told CBC they weren't offended by Trudeau's get-up, and see the scandal as a distraction from the real issues.  ""This was all done in good fun,"" said Jeff Murton.  Private school responds  Trudeau was a volunteer in charge of selling raffle tickets at the fundraiser, according to a gala co-chair, who did not want to be named.  Though many people wore costumes, Trudeau was the only person who blackened his face, the co-chair said.  The school's director of communications, Megan MacMillan, said the concerns raised about the photos of Trudeau ""align with our own values and commitment to inclusion and equality.""    ""Our 2001 gala event was organized by a culturally diverse group of parent volunteers and was intended to be celebratory and respectful. That said, we recognize cultural sensitivities have evolved over the past 18 years,"" MacMillan said in a written statement.  She said the school will be sending parents a letter about the photos.",politics

40,Maurizio Cattelan's golden toilet stolen from British art exhibit,"A unique solid gold toilet that was part of an art exhibit was stolen early Saturday from the magnificent home in England where British wartime leader Winston Churchill was born.  The toilet, valued at roughly £1 million pounds ($1.66 million Cdn), was the work of Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan.  The artwork, called America, had been installed only two days earlier at Blenheim Palace, west of London, after previously being shown to appreciative audiences at the Guggenheim Museum in New York.  Police said the toilet was taken early Saturday by thieves who used at least two vehicles.  Because it had been connected to the palace's plumbing system, police said the toilet's removal caused ""significant damage and flooding"" to the building, a UNESCO World Heritage site filled with valuable art and furniture.  A 66-year-old man was arrested in the case, but he has not been identified or charged.  Inspector Richard Nicholls from Thames Valley Police said police believe the thieves left the spacious property about 4:50 a.m. local time and that the toilet was the only item taken. Closed circuit TV footage is being studied in the investigation.  Prior to the theft, visitors to the Cattelan exhibition could book a three-minute appointment to use the toilet. This had proved popular when the toilet was on display at the Guggenheim.  Toilet not specially guarded  The artist intended the golden toilet to be a pointed satire about excessive wealth. Cattelan has previously said: ""Whatever you eat, a $200 lunch or a $2 hot dog, the results are the same, toilet-wise.""    The theft also comes after Edward Spencer-Churchill told The Times newspaper that the toilet would not be very easy to steal since it was connected to the palace's plumbing.  ""So no, I don't plan to be guarding it,"" he said.  Thames Valley Police Detective Inspector Jess Milne said: ""The artwork has not been recovered at this time but we are conducting a thorough investigation to find it and bring those responsible to justice.""    Blenheim Palace said officials are ""saddened"" by the theft but ""relieved no one was hurt.""  ""We knew there was huge interest in the Maurizio Cattelan contemporary art exhibition, with many set to come and enjoy the installations,"" the palace said in a tweet.  ""It's therefore a great shame an item so precious has been taken, but we still have so many fascinating treasures in the Palace and the remaining items of the exhibition to share.""  The building was closed to the public Saturday, but the palace said normal operations will resume Sunday.  The stately home in Oxfordshire, 105 km west of London, is popular with visitors and is occasionally used for special events including fashion shows and art exhibits.",entertainment
64,Scheer says he'd fast-track pipeline challenges straight to Supreme Court,"A Conservative government would overcome legal objections to building new petroleum pipelines by fast-tracking any cases right to the Supreme Court of Canada, party leader Andrew Scheer says.  Scheer and other Conservatives have for years said Ottawa has to ""assert federal jurisdiction'' to get important projects built, but he has not until now explained what that would mean in practice.  At a campaign stop Wednesday, Scheer was pushed on comments he made in recent days about asserting jurisdiction in the face of objections from Indigenous communities or provincial governments, including Quebec.  ""It's about fast-tracking some of the questions that have been raised by people who oppose the project,'' he said.  ""Fast-tracking those cases to the Supreme Court — referring those types of jurisdictional questions to the Supreme Court right away so that we can get certainty, instead of watching these court cases move slowly up and up, being appealed. We would have taken that directly to get finality on those decisions.''    The inability to get pipelines built has become a major source of frustration and anger in Alberta, where politicians from all parties believe other jurisdictions and communities are deliberately landlocking Alberta oil, harming its economy.  The Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, in particular, has been hit by court challenges from provincial and municipal governments, Indigenous communities and environmental groups.    Indigenous communities and environmental groups challenged federal approval of the expansion and won in a federal Court of Appeal case. After the federal government re-did consultations and approved the project again last spring, the same groups filed new objections. The court has agreed to hear Indigenous complaints, but rejected those brought by others.  Those cases could eventually make their way to the Supreme Court.    The Supreme Court is expected to hear an appeal early next year from the British Columbia government of a B.C. Court of Appeal opinion that the province couldn't restrict what flows through the pipeline, which is considered federal jurisdiction because it crosses provincial borders.  The B.C. case was seen as the final nail in the coffin for former pipeline owner Kinder Morgan's plans to proceed with the project.    Shortly afterwards, Kinder Morgan told the Liberals it was suspending work until the company had the government's guarantee the expansion would go ahead. When the company remained unconvinced in May 2018, the Liberal government stepped in and bought the pipeline for $4.5 billion.  Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the plan was to buy the pipeline, get through all the hurdles to the expansion, and then sell it to a private backer.    Scheer said Wednesday that in many cases the courts found the Liberal government hadn't properly consulted Indigenous communities — even though the courts have made such findings about both Liberal and Conservative governments.  The Court of Appeal's 2016 decision to overturn federal approval of the Northern Gateway pipeline was based on a finding of faulty consultations and reviews done by the former Conservative government.  The same court's decision on Trans Mountain, in August 2018, related to a review process done partly by the former Conservative government and partly by the Liberals.",politics
149,"General Motors strike enters 2nd week, no clear end in sight","The strike against General Motors by 49,000 United Auto Workers in the U.S. entered its second week Monday with progress reported in negotiations but no clear end in sight.  Bargainers met all weekend and returned to talks Monday morning as the strike entered its eighth day.  A person briefed on the negotiations said the two cases are haggling about wages and profit sharing, new product for factories that GM wants to close, a faster route to full wages for new hires and use of temporary workers. The person didn't want to be identified because details of the bargaining are confidential.  Workers walked off their jobs early on Sept. 16, paralyzing production at about 30 manufacturing sites in nine states.  Already, the strike has forced GM to shut down two Canadian factories that make engines, older-model pickup trucks and two car models. If the strike drags on much longer, GM likely will have to close more factories in Mexico and Canada because engines, transmissions and other components are built in the United States.  Companies that supply parts to GM also will have to start cutting production.    Consumers this week will start to see fewer trucks, SUVs and cars on dealer lots. Cox Automotive said GM had stocked up before the strike with a 77-day supply of vehicles. But before the walkout, the supply of larger SUVs such as the Chevrolet Tahoe already was below the industry average of 61 days worth of vehicles.  On Sunday, Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren joined members of the UAW and supporters as they picketed outside GM's Detroit-Hamtramck plant on Sunday.  ""Auto workers deserve good wages, comprehensive benefits, and economic security,"" Warren said.  Bernie Sanders, another Democratic presidential hopeful, will do the same on Wednesday. Sanders is urging GM to ""end the greed, sit down with the UAW and work out an agreement that treats your workers with the respect and the dignity they deserve.""  Workers demand fair share  Workers got their last GM paycheques last week, and will have to start living on $250 US per week in strike pay starting this week.  The union wants a bigger share of GM's more than $30 billion in profits during the past five years. But the company sees a global auto sales decline ahead and wants to bring its labour costs in line with U.S. plants owned by foreign automakers.    The top production worker wage is about $30 an hour, and GM's total labour costs including benefits are about $63 an hour compared with an average of $50 at factories run by foreign-based automakers mainly in southern states.  Issues snagging the talks include the formula for profit sharing, which the union wants to improve. Currently, workers get $1,000 for every $1 billion the company makes before taxes in North America. This year, workers got cheques for $10,750 each, less than last year's $11,500.    Wages also are an issue with the company seeking to shift compensation more to lump sums that depend on earnings and workers wanting hourly increases that will be there if the economy goes south.  They're also bargaining over use of temporary workers and a path to make them full time, as well as a faster track for getting newly hired workers to the top UAW wage.  GM has offered products in two of four locations where it wants to close factories. It has proposed an electric pickup truck for the Detroit-Hamtramck plant and a battery factory in the Lordstown, Ohio, about 125 kilometres from Pittsburgh, where it is closing a small-car assembly plant. The factory would be run by a joint venture, and although it would have UAW workers, GM is proposing they work for pay that's lower than the company pays at assembly plants.  This is the first national strike by the UAW since 2007, when the union shut down General Motors for two days.",business
65,Trudeau says he is 'deeply sorry' he appeared in brownface at school gala in 2001,"Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau says he knows now that his decision to dress up in brownface and a turban for a gala at a private school where he worked 18 years ago was a racist thing to do and he is now ""deeply sorry.""  Trudeau also admitted there was a second instance of racist behaviour. ""When I was in high school I dressed up at a talent show and sang Day-O with makeup on,"" he said.   Speaking to reporters on his campaign plane, Trudeau apologized for his actions, saying that he now recognizes his actions were racist.  ""In 2001, when I was a teacher in Vancouver, I attended a gala. The theme was Arabian Nights. I dressed up in an Aladdin costume and put makeup on. I shouldn't have done that. I should have known better, but I didn't and I'm really sorry.  ""I take responsibility for my decision to do that. I shouldn't have done it. I should have known better. It was something that I didn't think was racist at the time, but now I recognize it was something racist to do and I am deeply sorry.""  The 2001 incident  was brought to light Wednesday evening by an article in Time Magazine.  The article details how the picture of Trudeau appears in the 2000-01 yearbook of the West Point Grey Academy, a private school in Vancouver.   Time Magazine said Vancouver businessman Michael Adamson, who was a part of the West Point Grey Academy community, brought the photograph to the magazine's attention because he said he thought it should be made public.   Another image that appears to be Trudeau at the same school gala was posted in an April 2001 newsletter for the Vancouver school. The additional image, which is available in an online archive, surfaced after Trudeau first addressed his use of brownface and apologized for it.    Asked if he should resign his position as Liberal leader based on both incidents, Trudeau made the case that incidents like this should be treated on a ""case-by-case"" basis.   ""There are people who make mistakes in this life and you make decisions based on what they actually do, what they did and on a case-by-case basis. I deeply regret that I did that. I should have known better but I didn't,"" he said.     Trudeau said that he found out the story was going to break earlier in the day.  Asked if he understood why brownface and blackface was so hurtful to minorities Trudeau said he did.   ""I think it's well known that communities and people that live with intersectionalities and face discrimination the likes of which I have never personally had to experience is a significant thing that is very hurtful and that is why I am so deeply disappointed in myself,"" he said.     Unfit for office, Scheer says  Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said both incidents prove that Trudeau is not fit to hold the office of prime minister.   ""Like all Canadians, I was extremely shocked and disappointed when I learned of Justin Trudeau's actions this evening,"" Scheer said. ""Wearing brownface is an act of open mockery and racism. It was just as racist in 2001 as it is in 2019.  ""And what Canadians saw this evening was someone with a complete lack of judgment and integrity and someone who is not fit to govern this country.""    NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Trudeau's behaviour was ""troubling"" and ""insulting.""   ""It's making a mockery of someone for what they live and what their lived experiences are,"" Singh said. ""I think he needs to answer for it. I think he needs to answer the question why he did that and what does that say about what he thinks about people who, because of who they are, because of the colour of their skin, face challenges and barriers and obstacles in their life.""  ""Racism is real. People in this room have felt it, have heard this story. I've experienced it in my life. he's got to answer those questions.""    After Trudeau's apology Singh delivered a message to Canadian children of colour.   ""The kids that see this image, the people that see this image, are going to think about all the times in their life that they were made fun of, that they were hurt, that they were hit, that they were insulted, that they were made to feel less because of who they are and I want to talk to those people right now,"" Singh said.   ""I want to talk to all the kids out there,"" he said. ""You might feel like giving up on Canada. You might feel like giving up on yourselves. I want you to know that you have value, you have worth and you are loved and I don't want you to give up on Canada and please don't give up on yourselves.""    Incident 'reprehensible': Canadian Muslim organization  The National Council of Canadian Muslims said Trudeau's appearance in brownface was ""reprehensible.""  ""Seeing the prime minister in brownfaceu002Fblackface is deeply saddening,"" said NCCM's Executive Director Mustafa Farooq in a Tweet. ""The wearing of blackfaceu002Fbrownface is reprehensible, and hearkens back to a history of racism and an Orientalist mythology which is unacceptable.""    The council said that while it recognizes that people can change and evolve over time, it was critical that Trudeau ""unequivocally apologizes"" for the incident. After Trudeau made his public apology, the NCCM issued another tweet thanking him.",politics
231,"Love it, list it or litigate? Home reno show crew denies liability after disgruntled couple sues","The producers and a contractor behind the home reno show Love It Or List It Vancouver have denied all the accusations made by a dissatisfied couple who sued them last year, saying all the renovations at the heart of the lawsuit were completed properly.  Even if the work hadn't been done right, a response to the civil claim said, it wouldn't matter because the North Vancouver, B.C., homeowners gave up any right to sue when they signed a sweeping contract agreeing to be on the show.  ""The plaintiffs assumed any and all liability for all of the renovation work following the [on-air] reveal,"" read the court document filed in July on behalf of the production company and the contractor.  Jeanine Almeida and Norman Waine filed their lawsuit against the company behind the show on May 9, 2018, claiming producers brought in an actor with no contracting experience to work on their Lynn Valley home for their episode.     The couple also claimed the renovation was riddled with defects that could lead to mould, fires, water damage and high concentrations of carbon dioxide — putting their family's health and safety at risk.  None of the couple's allegations have been proven in court.     Watch the episode here    The company, its producers and the contractor have asked for the case to be dismissed entirely.  The response to the couple's claim, filed in B.C. Supreme Court, said the renovation is up to code. It also said the contractor is not an actor and has 30 years of experience in construction.    Almeida, Waine and their four children appeared on season four of the show in 2016.       During each episode, families have to decide whether to keep their current home. Two hosts, one real estate agent and one designer, try to sway participants to move or stay.  The real estate agent works to find a new house on the market suited to the family, while the designer renovates the participants' current home. At the end of the episode, homeowners choose to move or stay in their spruced-up old house, which is shown to them in a walk-through on camera.  Almeida and Waine claimed they paid the show's production company, Should I Stay or Should I Go West Productions, more than $175,000 for the renovation.    The kitchen, dining room, laundry room, garage and back deck were transformed. During the on-air reveal of their new house, Almeida and Waine said they loved the ""gorgeous"" final product.  They claimed issues cropped up after the show aired.  In their lawsuit, the couple said they signed a contract agreeing that work would be carried out by Kenny Gemmill, the show's resident contractor, or a ""reasonable alternative."" Almeida and Waine claimed the show instead hired Kerry van der Griend, whom they described as an actor with ""little to no experience"" as a general contractor.       The defendants said that allegation alone is ""reckless"" and false. The court filing said the couple's allegations have harmed Van der Griend personally and professionally.  Almeida and Waine are asking for damages for breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation, as well as general and special damages. They did not specify how much compensation they were seeking.  The defendants denied the couple ""suffered any loss, damage or expense, as alleged or at all.""

107,False online rumour claims RCMP chief is married to Bill Morneau's cousin,"A rumour that RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki's husband is related to Finance Minister Bill Morneau was shared widely online over the past week. The rumour claims the supposed familial relationship is the reason the RCMP has not launched an official investigation into the Trudeau government's handling of the SNC-Lavalin scandal.  But it's not true. Morneau and Lucki's husband aren't related.  The unfounded rumour appears to be based on hearsay and was first mentioned by a Twitter account with fewer than 500 followers, offering no evidence of a link between the two officials. The rumour was then amplified to reach an audience of tens of thousands of Canadians on Facebook and Twitter in a matter of days.   Asked about the rumour by CBC News, both the RCMP and Morneau responded with statements confirming there was no family relationship between Lucki's husband, Ray Gauthier, and Bill Morneau.    ""These allegations are false,"" said a spokesperson for Bill Morneau's campaign team in an email to CBC News.  Acting Sgt. Caroline Duval, an RCMP spokesperson, told CBC the force had confirmed that Gauthier is not related to Morneau.  CBC News also reviewed publicly-available family trees for both Morneau and Lucki's husband, as well as several family obituaries, and could find no link between the two.  Primed to go viral  This kind of rumour is primed to go viral because it fits into an existing belief system, said Christopher Schneider, an associate professor of sociology at Brandon University in Manitoba who studies social media and policing.  ""There's already an existent narrative that this particular meme and rumour can be placed neatly into, whether it's real or false,"" Schneider said. ""They want to believe that there's some sort of dirt, or something going on with the investigation, or that there is corruption there.""  He added that the specifics of the rumour are believable but hard to verify — which makes it even more likely to be shared.  ""It's also not completely implausible. It's not a meme that says, 'Brenda Lucki has two heads and secretly hides one of her heads.' The idea that she could be married to somebody's cousin doesn't seem out of the realm of possibility,"" Schneider said.  The rumour also emerged as the RCMP is facing questions about its own internal affairs, after senior intelligence officer Cameron Ortis was charged with violating Canada's official secrets act.  First tweeted by account with just a few hundred followers  The first mention of the rumour that CBC managed to find on social media appeared on Aug. 26. In a response to a tweet about the RCMP and SNC-Lavalin, an unidentified person who goes by ""Kim"" claimed that they had obtained information from a retired RCMP officer.  ""[Minister of Public Security] Ralph Goodale has tied the hands of the commissioner, who is married to a relative of Bill Morneau,"" this person claimed, offering no evidence.  In fact, in a later tweet, the user expressed frustration over being unable to find any information about the family of Lucki or Gauthier. When contacted via Twitter, the person running the account refused to speak with CBC. The initial tweet was shared 29 times.  That tweet is the earliest instance of the allegation that CBC News could find online. All of the early tweets and Facebook posts propagating the rumour either cite this tweet, or other posts referencing it, as evidence. No earlier traces of the rumour have been found and the original tweeter seems to indicate that they obtained their information from an in-person conversation, not from an online source.    The unfounded rumour had a limited spread immediately following its first mention. CBC News managed to find a handful of tweets referencing it, as well as some Facebook posts, none of which garnered a large number of reactions.  But on September 10, the false story began picking up steam. The rumour began popping up in response to reporters' tweets about a Globe &amp; Mail story alleging that the Trudeau government had refused to lift cabinet confidentiality on the SNC-Lavalin issue, blocking RCMP inquiries into whether the SNC-Lavalin case amounted to obstruction of justice.  The Globe also reported that the RCMP were pausing their inquiries because of the federal election campaign.   Mentions of the rumour also appeared in responses to a tweet by an obscure Canadian conspiracy website on Sept. 13. Some of those responses claimed Lucki herself was Morneau's cousin; the website subsequently tweeted out the cousin rumour later in the day.  From there, the story reached a larger audience beginning September 15, when memes featuring pictures of Lucki and Morneau and the false rumour of their connection started to emerge. Several partisan commentators and pages on both Twitter and Facebook shared these memes, generating thousands of shares and comments.    Exact numbers are difficult to determine because many different versions of the memes and posts pushing the rumour were shared across social media platforms.  The story was posted on Sept. 16 by Alberta Canada Campaign, a Facebook page that's part of a network of partisan pages created by former Conservative Party organizer Larry Brandt. The post was shared 3,300 times. (Incidentally, the person listed as the administrator of Alberta Canada Campaign, Maureen Gow Zelmer, was also one of the first people to post the rumour to Facebook on Aug. 26.)  ""A rumour like this quickly gains a life of its own,"" Schneider said. ""Even while news journalists investigate this and debunk it, that does not necessarily deter the circulation and the virality, because in certain circumstances, people want to believe this.""",technology
167,U.S. excludes another 437 Chinese-made product types from Trump's tariffs next month,"The U.S. has exempted another 437 types of products from China from the tariffs Washington had previously threatened to impose on them, in the latest sign that the combatants in the Sino-American trade war are getting a little gun-shy.  According to documents posted on the website of the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative on Friday, the agency has granted temporary exemptions to hundreds of products that had previously been slated to have tariffs of between 10 and 25 per cent imposed on them under proclamations that U.S. President Donald Trump has made in recent months.  The products run the gamut from consumer products such as lamp shades, Christmas lights, coffee filters, dog leashes and bicycles to industrial products such as electric motors and generators, all the way to highly sophisticated technology components such as ultrasonic scanners and MRI parts.  According to Chinese media outlet CCTV, the entire list covers about one-eighth — or less than 13 per cent — of the original list of $250 billion worth of Chinese goods that Trump had targeted in his trade war earlier this year.  Trump has been putting tariffs — taxes imposed on importers when they bring goods into the country — on Chinese goods as a way of trying to pressure Beijing into balancing the trade relationship between the two countries.    His latest round of tariffs were set to kick in on Oct. 15, but Friday's news means the 437 items on the exemption list won't have any tariffs imposed on them on that date. The USTR documents make it clear, however, that the exemptions are not permanent, which leaves the door open to reimposing them later on.  The move comes as U.S. and Chinese negotiators had face-to-face talks in Washington this week. With another round of tariffs set to be implemented soon, strategist Chris Krueger of Cowan Research Group said ""we would interpret another delay as a goodwill gesture.""  Last week, China made such a gesture of its own by exempting 16 different types of U.S. agricultural products, including soybeans and pork, from its own import levies, a move that Krueger described as ""the quid for the quo of some tariff relief.""  ""All of this could go sideways [again],"" he said, but added that even such a modest rapprochement on the trade file could be ""a signal that the trade war is entering into a frozen conflict.""",business
82,NDP promises free dental care for households making under $70K starting in 2020,"The NDP is promising free dental care for households making under $70,000 starting next year if it wins a mandate in the federal election.  NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh made the announcement in Sudbury, Ont., Wednesday morning on Day 8 of the election campaign.  The party says it would immediately implement a public dental care plan to cover uninsured Canadians.  Dental care would be free for households making under $70,000, with a sliding co-payment for those earning between $70,000 and $90,000.  The party says the covered services would include examinations, cleanings and fluoride rinses, x-rays, teeth fillings, crowns, root canals, treatments for gum disease, dentures and braces for non-cosmetic purposes.  The party estimates its initial plan would cover 4.3 million Canadians and would save a family of four (if the household makes $70,000 or less) roughly $1,240.    ""It is bold, it is exciting, I'm kind of getting goosebumps when I think about it because we can actually cover so many Canadians that don't have coverage,"" Singh told reporters.  ""It'll make people healthier.""  The Parliamentary Budget Office costed the plan and said it would cost nearly $1.9 billion for 2020-2021, ""because we assume that untreated oral diseases occurring prior to 2020 are treated in 2020.""  Watch: Singh promises dental care plan for low-income Canadians    That PBO estimate drops to $824 million in 2021-2022 and remains relatively stable at $856 million by 2028-2029.  Singh said the coverage would come under a federal insurance program, which would help avoid negotiations with the provinces. The party said dentists and community health centres would be reimbursed for the services they provide.  Singh called the announcement ""a down payment"" on party founder Tommy Douglas's goal of having dental care included in Canada's health care system.  The party laid out the bare bones of a plan back in June in an early platform release.  ""A New Democrat government will work together with provincial partners, health professionals and dentists to develop a roadmap to including dental care in the Canada Health Act,"" says the document.",health
154,Why people who need help most lose out on election handout promises: Don Pittis,"There is lots of research that shows the best thing you could do for the Canadian economy in the long run is to wipe out poverty and help young people.  While parties of the left and right may identify differing strategies to do it, most politicians know poverty and youth-gone-wrong are bad for the country as a whole. They contribute to crime and poor health outcomes and create a lingering burden on the better off parts of the economy.  But experts who have studied the phenomenon say something strange happens to those good intentions during elections. They say the calculus of winning forces political parties that want to win into narrowing their focus to the richer and the older.  ""In our system, once the election thinking takes over, the professionals take over in a sense and their basic goal is to maximize returns, in other words, 'How do we maximize the number of seats we can win?'"" says Henry Milner, a scholar who has written extensively on Canadian and Quebec democracy.   The essential goal of those professional campaign organizers, the shadowy people behind the politicians charged with getting their candidates elected, is to identify undecided voters and appeal to the majority of them.   ""Very seldom are those young people or poor people,"" says Milner, author of The Internet Generation: Engaged Citizens or Political Dropouts, who has a research chair in electoral studies at the University of Montreal.  Voting at 16?  Repeated studies in Canada and elsewhere have shown that younger and poorer people don't exercise their right to vote at the same rate as those who are older and wealthier.  While most Canadian electoral research doesn't focus directly on income — including the 2016 Statistics Canada report on the rise in voting turnouts between the 2011 and the most recent 2015 federal election — proxies for income such as education levels and home ownership show it happens here as well.      According to Milner, it may be that young and poorer people are focused on factors other than electoral politics. Poorer people may be in ethnic subgroups, busy with lives in turmoil or without a tradition of political participation.  Similarly when young people hit voting age at 18 they are often at an unstable point. Having just finished high school, they are struggling to find work or housing or finding their way in relationships and post-secondary eduction.    That's why one of Milner's proposals is to experiment with a voting age of 16 to inculcate the tradition of voting while young people are still embedded in a relatively stable life of home and school.  Milner says not being exposed to traditional sources of Canadian news such as radio, TV or newspapers may also make a difference.  ""The internet yes, if you are interested in [politics] you can find it easily, but if you're not interested particularly, it is just so easy to avoid it entirely,"" says Milner.  However there are signs political leaders should be wary of assuming young voters are ill-informed when issues arise that strike a chord. The CBC site for Snapchat, the source used by some of the youngest media viewers, got hundreds of thousands of hits within a few hours following the Justin Trudeau brownface story.  Youth issues   ""You could have a special case where an issue comes up that really affects young people,"" says Milner. ""One might argue that climate change may be emerging as such.""  Certainly youth voting bounced back from what experts called crisis levels before the 2015 vote where fewer than 40 per cent of eligible voters between 18 and 25 cast their vote. Those low levels led some to suggest voting would have to be made compulsory. And even 2015's rebound  of seven percentage points left the youth vote far behind older groups.  Milner is convinced Trudeau's image as a youthful outsider who young voters could identify with was partly responsible for a recovery from the lowest levels. Election experts will be waiting anxiously to see whether, once drawn into the election process, they will vote again this time.  The other reason that long-term economic proposals are not directed at the young is that there's evidence younger people don't pay attention, tending to live in the moment. However, economic issues that affect young people directly, such as sharp rises in tuition in Quebec, attracted the attention of young voters.    Another long-time scholar of the electoral process, Keith Banting, currently at the School of Policy Studies at Ontario's Queen's University, says a new feeling of anxiety among the Canadian middle class has made politicians wary of explicitly targeting economic policy toward the poor.  ""It's not a surprise to me that we have over the last 20 years shifted our priorities from helping the poor to helping people who are under pressure in the broad middle class,"" says Banting.  Redistribution by stealth  He says research by the people in the centre-left of U.S. politics has determined that fighting poverty does not motivate voters, so instead they drew voters to the polls by focusing on ""the stressed middle."" Essentially they found people were so worried about themselves they seem unable to think about helping those less fortunate.  In Canada too, says Banting, anti-poverty policies, while good for the economy over the long term, are simply not politically sustainable. Instead, Canada's parties, which all cling to the political centre and realize the benefits of bringing the poorest into the more active part of the Canadian economy, indulge in something Banting calls ""redistribution by stealth.""  As an example, Banting recalls an eight-page Liberal Party document on child benefit payments which would clearly help poor people the most but was also clearly addressed to the better off people whose political support the party needed.   ""The word poverty did not appear in the document but it was sold as helping the middle class and, quote, those struggling hard to join us.""     Follow Don on Twitter @don_pittis",business
125,The Cars lead singer Ric Ocasek dead at 75,"Ric Ocasek — The Cars lead singer whose deadpan vocal delivery and lanky, sunglassed look defined a rock era with chart-topping hits like Just What I Needed — was discovered dead Sunday afternoon in his Manhattan apartment.  The New York Police Department said that officers found the 75-year-old Ocasek at about 4 p.m. ET after responding to a 911 call. They said there were no signs of foul play and that the medical examiner was to determine a cause of death.  The death comes a year after The Cars were inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, followed by an announcement by model Paulina Porizkova on social media that she and Ocasek had separated after 28 years of marriage. The pair first met while filming the music video for Drive, another Cars hit.  Ocasek — who sang, played guitar and wrote most of the band's songs — and Benjamin Orr, who played bass and also sang, were ex-hippie buddies who formed The Cars in Boston in 1976. They were a decade older than many of their modern-rock compatriots but became one of the most essential American bands of the late 1970s and 1980s with their fusion of new wave, 1960s pop and 1970s glam.  Ocasek's minimalist, half-spoken deadpan vocals set made the band's sound, and his long, lanky appearance formed their lasting image.  The first three songs on their 1978 self-titled first album were all hit singles and remain widely known classics and oldies radio airplay: Good Times Roll, My Best Friend's Girl and Just What I Needed.    They had 10 other singles in the Billboard top 40, and of their six studio albums, four were in Billboard's top 10.  The band's commercial peak came with 1984's Heartbeat City, which featured the hit singles You Might Think and Magic, sung by Ocasek, and the atypical ballad Drive, sung by Orr.  They were always an MTV favourite, and the whimsical, partly animated video for You Might Think along with the mournful video for Drive brought them near-constant airplay on the channel in the mid-1980s.  The band broke up in 1988, but their influence would be deeply felt in the 1990s and beyond. Kurt Cobain and Nirvana covered My Best Friend's Girl at their last live show in 1994, and Ocasek produced albums for a diverse list of artists including Weezer, No Doubt, Bad Brains, Bad Religion, Suicide, Le Tigre, Guided by Voices and Romeo Void.    The Cars were inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in 2018 after being nominated twice before. During the ceremony, Ocasek paid tribute to Orr, who died in 2000 of pancreatic cancer.  ""It's quite strange to be here without him,"" Ocasek said.  In announcing the separation last year, Porizkova said that their family is ""a well-built car."" But she says that ""as a bicycle, my husband and I no longer pedal in unison."" Ocasek had six sons, two from each of his three marriages.  He grew up in Baltimore, and his family moved to Cleveland when he was a teenager. After graduating high school he had stints at Antioch College and Bowling Green State University in the mid-1960s before dropping out to pursue music.  Ocasek met Orr in 1965 and they formed their own first band called ID Nirvana in 1968. In the 1970s they relocated to Boston and formed bands including the folk-rock Milkwood and also played as an acoustic duo before finding their calling when they created The Cars.  Weezer, Carl Newman of New Pornographers and Greg Harris, the CEO of the Rock Hall, were among those who paid tribute on social media.",entertainment
1,NDP's dental plan seen as smart policy - but some costs are uncertain,"The Claim:  ""It's about choices. $860 million to assure that 4.3 million Canadians have dental services is a priority for us.""  -- NDP leader Jagmeet Singh, announcing his party's vow to provide free dental care to Canadians whose household incomes are less than $70,000 a year and don't already have private or public coverage.  The Facts: The NDP plan, unveiled Wednesday morning at an event in Sudbury, Ont., aims to provide full, federally funded dental coverage to uninsured individuals with a household income of less than $70,000 a year. It would also pay a portion of the costs — on a sliding scale — for uninsured households making up to $90,000.   The plan would begin in January 2020 and cover an extensive array of preventative and restorative services, including exams, cleanings, fluoride treatments, X-rays, filings, crowns, root canals and treatment for gum diseases, as well as the cost of dentures and braces for non-cosmetic purposes.   And the NDP hopes to extend it even further, with Singh billing it as ""our first step toward the dream of universal denticare for all.""   The Office of the Parliamentary Budget Officer has costed the NDP plan, crunching data on the number of currently uninsured individuals, household income, the prevalence of dental problems and treatment fees, estimating that about three-quarters of all eligible people would actually use the program.   On that basis, the PBO says that the cost for the first, partial fiscal year would be $560 million, then rise to $1.884 billion in fiscal 2020u002F21 — a ""one-time"" surge due to oral diseases that had previously gone untreated. After that, the program will cost around $830 million a year through 2024u002F25, rising to $856 million by 2028u002F29.    The PBO says its estimate has ""moderate uncertainty,"" due to its assumptions about population growth, disease prevalence, utilization rates, inflation and the possibility that the new federal plan might cause existing public and private insurers to reduce or cancel their coverage, thereby increasing Ottawa's costs.   How far would all that money go?  The NDP provides an example of a family of four — two adults, two children — with an income of $70,000. Assuming that each family member has one dental exam, two cleanings, and that each child has a cavity filled, the party says their savings under the program would be $1,240, or $310 each.  Many have no coverage  According to statistics provided by the Canadian Dental Association, the estimated total expenditure on dental services in this country in 2015 was $13.6 billion — about $380 per capita. But given that up to a third of Canadians have no public or private coverage and visit the dentist infrequently, if ever, the actual average cost per patient is surely much higher.  And if the NDP were to succeed in convincing 4.3 million more people to seek dental care each year, the Parliamentary Budget Officer's estimates might be on the low side. For example, in the unlikely scenario of 100 per cent utilization, the $831 million earmarked for 2022u002F23 works out to just $193.26 per person.  A lot will depend on details that have yet to be provided.  ""We're very interested to understand clearly who is going to be covered and what will be covered and to what degree,"" says Dr. Sandy Mutchmor, president of the Canadian Dental Association.   Mutchmor says it's hard to assign a per procedure cost; there are small cavities and big ones, some cleanings are more difficult than others — it's a matter of time and complexity. And as the PBO has estimated with its second-year surge, people who haven't been seeing the dentist on a regular basis are likely to need more extensive and frequent treatment, at least initially.     Still, the CDA welcomes the NDP proposal. ""Anything that provides more treatment is a step in the right direction,"" says Mutchmor.    There could also be a net saving to other parts of the health-care system.  Would relieve a lot of suffering  Dr. Gerry Uswak, an associate dean at the University of Saskatchewan College of Dentistry and past president of the Canadian Association of Public Health Dentistry, says the NDP plan would relieve a great deal of dental pain and suffering and help with the treatment of other chronic diseases.  He points to non-insulin dependent diabetes as an example. Some patients develop a related periodontal disease. And their diabetes is much harder to control if the reciprocal gum infection is left untreated.   ""That's the best use of public funds,"" says Uswak, ""getting people the care they need sooner rather than later.""   Dr. Carlos Quiñonez, an associate professor of dentistry at the University of Toronto who studies the intersection of politics and teeth, says the plan addresses a need.  ""There's clearly people out there who can't access dental care,"" he says. ""And it's not just really low-income groups. We've done research that shows that affordability challenges are now reaching into even the middle-income categories.""   Quiñonez says the budget estimate for the program sounds a bit low — provincial dental plans are spending between $300 to $700 per patient. However, the NDP proposal would effectively double the amount that Canadian governments are spending on dental care, which would be a good thing.  ""The idea of providing more coverage is definitely a laudable and worthwhile endeavour,"" says Quiñonez. ""But the devil is in the details.""  The Verdict: It's complicated. The Parliamentary Budget Officer has provided a price tag for the NDP plan, but the absence of details makes it hard to say whether the amount will be enough to provide dental coverage to 4.3 million more people, as Jagmeet Singh has promised.

54,"Trudeau apologizes again, says he can't remember exact number of blackface incidents","In his first formal press conference since the blackface scandal erupted, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau said today his privileged upbringing blinded him to the profound harm caused by his past racist acts.  At a campaign event in Winnipeg Thursday, Trudeau apologized directly to racialized Canadians after more bombshell images surfaced of him in blackface.  Trudeau said he did not understand at the time how hurtful his actions were and, as a result, he can't remember exactly how many times he has worn blackface makeup.  ""I am wary of being definitive about this. The recent pictures I had not remembered,"" he said when pressed by reporters about the number of incidents.  ""I think the question is, 'How can you not remember that?' The fact is, I didn't understand how hurtful this is to people who live with discrimination every single day. I have always acknowledged I come from a place of privilege, but I now need to acknowledge that comes with a massive blind spot.""  On Wednesday evening, Trudeau recounted just two incidents of blackface. A third image of him in blackface surfaced in video form Thursday.  Trudeau said he never spoke about the incidents before now because he was ""embarrassed,"" adding that his past actions do not define the politician he has become since.  ""What I did ... hurt people who shouldn't have to face intolerance and discrimination because of their identity. This is something that I deeply, deeply regret,"" he said.  ""Darkening your face, regardless of the context of the circumstances, is always unacceptable because of the racist history of blackface. I should have understood that then, and I never should have done it.""    The Liberal campaign is in full-blown damage control mode over a scandal that threatens to put the Trudeau brand and the party's electoral fortunes in jeopardy.  Trudeau, known globally for his ""diversity is our strength"" mantra, is making international headlines after photographs and a video emerged showing him in racist makeup. He apologized late Wednesday and admitted his past actions were racist.  Trudeau spent the first part of today reaching out to candidates, party staff and community leaders to try to explain his actions. The Liberal campaign cancelled a morning event before scheduling an afternoon media event in Winnipeg.  'Terrible mistake'  He asked Canadians to forgive him for what he acknowledged was a ""terrible mistake.""  ""I have dedicated my leadership and my service to Canada to try and counter intolerance and racism everywhere I can, but this has been ... a moment I've had to reflect on the fact that wanting to do good and wanting to do better simply isn't good enough,"" he said.  He said he spoke with his own children about the incidents, a conversation the campaign said was held via Facetime, and he became emotional when he spoke of parents having ""uncomfortable and hurtful"" conversations with their own kids today because of his actions.  Asked if he's considering stepping aside to let someone else lead the party through the election, Trudeau did not answer directly, but said he would ""continue to do the work that is necessary to keep us moving forward in the right way.""    ""Canadians have an important choice to make on October 21st and I trust Canadians to make that right choice,"" he said.  ""I certainly hope that they will continue to support us in the work that we're doing, but they might not. And I know that is something that all Canadians get to decide and they get to bring in all sorts of different factors, because every Canadian has a different way of looking at what matters to them.""  The controversy is drawing mixed reactions from the Liberal ranks.    Greg Fergus, a black Liberal MP seeking re-election in Hull-Aylmer, Que., said Trudeau should be judged on his ""great record"" promoting equality and diversity, not on incidents nearly 20 years in the past.  ""I think those are really the measure of the man and that's the reason why I have confidence in his continuing leadership,"" he said.    Fergus said the prime minister likely did not divulge his past behaviour earlier because he was embarrassed and ashamed. He said Trudeau called him personally before the story emerged late Wednesday.  Fergus said many of the black Canadians he has spoken with since the scandal broke are confused and offended.  'People are feeling hurt'  ""It's going to be rough. People are feeling hurt,"" he said.  The 2001 incident, which saw a 29-year-old Trudeau wear blackface as part of an Aladdin costume for a school fundraising event called Arabian Nights, was brought to light by an article in Time Magazine. A photo and separate video of other incidents were subsequently released showing Trudeau in racist makeup.  Omar Alghabra, who is seeking re-election as a Liberal MP for Mississauga Centre, also received a call from Trudeau before the story broke. He said the prime minister wanted to give him heads up, to apologize and to extend a commitment to continue his work.  Despite the warning, he said he was taken aback by the images.    ""My heart sank,"" he said. ""It's not something I expected to see Justin Trudeau doing. But I can't really explain how or why it happened.""  Alghabra said he did not know Trudeau 20 years ago, but the man he knows now fights against hate, intolerance and prejudice.  ""He's been a champion to combat against the type of pain this picture is causing,"" he said.  ""The person I know of Justin Trudeau for the last seven or eight years is a champion against intolerance and racism. Not just lip service, but with real deeds and real action. That is the Justin Trudeau I know. I can't explain those pictures.""  Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi issued a strong statement condemning the images.  ""I was very disheartened and disappointed to see these images. These indefensible images bring back many painful memories of racism that I and other racialized Canadians have experienced throughout their lives,"" he said.  Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan said today that what Trudeau did ""was wrong then, and it's wrong now,"" but his policies show a commitment to promoting diversity.  ""Absolutely, those pictures are hurtful. I know how much he regrets it,"" Sajjan said in an interview Thursday with CBC Radio's The Early Edition host Stephen Quinn in Vancouver.    Katie Omstead, the Liberal candidate for Chatham-Kent-Leamington, issued a statement Thursday saying that she is ""disappointed"" by the images.  ""I simply don't care how old these images are. Being a teacher, my heart goes out to students everywhere who have been affected by racism, homophobia and bullying,"" she said.  ""We've seen him apologize sincerely, and accept full responsibility. I know, as does he, how serious this is. We need to continue to have conversations about discrimination, and what we can do to teach our children, and those of us who lead, to respect the diversity of all Canadians. We all need to be better.""    Part of the Liberal campaign strategy has been to call out Conservative candidates for past indiscretions. Some opponents are calling Trudeau a hypocrite today.  Liberal commentator Susan Smith said Trudeau must keep apologizing and emphasizing the work he has done on diversity as an MP and as prime minister, such as appointing a diverse cabinet, welcoming Syrian refugees and promoting Indigenous reconciliation and gender equality.  ""For voters, the intent, the track record as PM and the future vision will likely matter more than the distant past,"" Smith said.    ""When the dust settles, I think the real question for Canadians is, 'Do you think Justin Trudeau is a racist?' And if people are being honest with themselves, the answer is, 'No.'""    While it may be a factor for some Canadians on voting day, Smith said she doubts it will be a key ballot issue.    Former Liberal MP Marlene Jennings defended Trudeau on Twitter, praising him for owning up to his mistakes ""openly, honestly"" and making real efforts to do better.  Liberal MP Nick Whalen tweeted that he spoke about the issue with his children, saying they immediately understood that ""dressing up as cultures"" is wrong, disrespectful and oppressive.",politics
160,Meng Wanzhou back in spotlight as lawyers set to argue for disputed arrest documents,"Vancouver makes an unlikely front line in the battle between global superpowers.  But the Huawei executive whose arrest last year placed Canada in the middle of a conflict between China and the United States will again take centre stage in a B.C. courtroom this week.  Meng Wanzhou's lawyers will begin eight days of hearings Monday, scheduled to argue for access to documents related to her initial detention and arrest at Vancouver's airport last December on a warrant for extradition to the U.S.  In the time since the Huawei chief financial officer's last in-person court appearance in May, tensions between Canada and China have only worsened.  The relationship between China and the United States has also further deteriorated — and as they make their case, Meng's lawyers will argue that U.S. President Donald Trump is using their client as a bargaining chip in a trade war.  ""The U.S. is attempting to use these extradition proceedings for economic and political gain,"" Meng's defence team said in a document filed with the court in advance of this week's hearing.  Accused of violating U.S. sanctions  Meng — daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei — was arrested on Dec. 1, 2018, on a stopover from Hong Kong to Mexico City. Her ultimate destination was Buenos Aires.  Both Meng and Huawei as a company face 13 criminal counts of conspiracy, fraud and obstruction in the U.S.  The charges relate to an alleged scheme to circumvent sanctions against Iran through Skycom, a shadow company in Tehran that prosecutors claim was actually controlled by Huawei.    Meng is accused of lying about the relationship of the two companies to an HSBC executive during a meeting at a Hong Kong restaurant in 2013 — allegedly putting U.S. banks at risk of violating sanctions.  Both she and Huawei have denied all the allegations.  The 47-year-old has been living under a form of house arrest in one of her two multi-million-dollar Vancouver homes after being released on $10 million bail in the weeks following her initial detention.  'Unlawfully detained, searched and interrogated'  Last December, President Donald Trump said he would be willing to intervene with the U.S. Justice Department in the case against Meng, if it would help secure a trade deal with Beijing.  In documents filed with the court in advance of this week's proceedings, Meng's lawyers claim Trump's comments provide ""important context to what occurred"" in the days and hours leading up to her arrest.  They accuse American and Canadian authorities of using the CBSA's extraordinary powers of detention to mount a ""covert criminal investigation"" against their client.  They claim RCMP originally planned to arrest Meng on the plane, but changed their minds for some unknown reason.  Notes included in a defence application for documents also show that a CBSA officer asked Meng about Huawei's business in Iran as she watched him inspect her bags.    Meng's lawyers ultimately plan to argue that all those factors contribute to abuses of process serious enough to have the case tossed.  But first they hope to convince B.C. Supreme Court Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes to order the disclosure of notes, emails, texts, reports and any other documents they believe will help them make their case.  ""[Meng] submits that she was unlawfully detained, searched and interrogated at YVR under a ruse carried out by the CBSA, RCMP and American authorities, for the benefit of and likely at the direction of the FBI and other U.S. authorities,"" the defence team claims.  ""In these circumstances, one would reasonably expect that the FBI was in communication with the [Department of Justice], the RCMP andu002For CBSA throughout these events ... Yet none of this material has been disclosed.""  A legal tangle  Monday's hearing will be the first time Meng has made a public appearance in months, guaranteeing a flock of media from around the world.  Her extradition hearing itself isn't slated to begin until January 2020. A separate hearing is also slated for next year to deal with the abuse of process allegations.    But a variety of legal proceedings have to play out before any of that can happen.  Adding to the legal complications, Meng is suing both the Canada Border Services Agency and the RCMP for allegedly violating her Charter rights during her initial arrest and detention.  The civil suit is a separate process to the extradition proceedings, but both will focus intense scrutiny on the events leading up to and including Meng's arrest — including the reason authorities allegedly made a last-minute decision to have CBSA officers detain Meng instead of arresting her either on the plane or as she disembarked.  Hearings in both cases are scheduled for Monday morning.  A 'ruse' to get information?  Meng's civil lawyers have interviewed Canadian officials at length as part of the discovery process and have told the court her extradition lawyers want to see those transcripts — which have not yet been entered into the record.  At a sparsely attended hearing a few weeks ago, Chief Justice Christopher Hinkson expressed some doubts about the motivation for the civil case.    ""I'm concerned that what's going on in this civil lawsuit is just a ruse to get information for the extradition proceedings,"" Hinkson told Meng's civil lawyers.  But Meng's civil lawyer, Howard Mickelson, claimed there was ""meat on the bones"" of the allegations that Meng's rights had been violated and that her two separate legal teams were not working together.  It's all likely to contribute to a day of unprecedented activity at the court.  'People are puzzled'  Meanwhile, the ripples from Meng's arrest continue to be felt in both Canada and China.  The Chinese government has blocked imports of canola seeds, pork and beef from Canada.  Two Canadians accused of drug trafficking in China have been sentenced to death.    And Canadians Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig remain in custody in China. The two men, who are accused of spying, were arrested within days of Meng's detention in Vancouver.  China has denied that any of these actions were taken in direct retaliation, but Chinese officials have made no secret of their displeasure with Canada's decision to assist the U.S. with Meng's extradition.  Paul Evans, a University of B.C. professor who is director emeritus of the Institute of Asian Research, says Meng's situation has captured the world's attention.  Evans says he's spoken with people across the country about the case and the underlying issues. Feelings are mixed, he says, but even the most tangled of court appearances will have the ability to spark debate.  ""People are puzzled about Meng, but they generally are divided on whether they're sympathetic to her, whether they see her caught in a vice knot of her own making, whether this has been sprung on us by the Americans,"" he says.  'Something that frightens'  Evans says the longer the case drags on, the more concern for Kovrig and Spavor will eclipse Meng's legal peril, especially considering the draconian conditions of their incarceration compared to Meng's gold-plated house arrest.  He says the case raises questions about the possibility of extradition being used as a tool for the United States to pursue a vendetta — questions at the heart of this week's proceedings.    Meng's extradition lawyers have argued that for years, U.S. officials ""have been stopping Huawei employees at U.S. ports of entry in order to gather evidence"" as part of an ""overall escalation in tactics"" against Huawei.  ""When we talk about who's breaking the rule of law, who's breaking international norms, this thing that the United States has done in going after Meng, is something that frightens the Chinese, it frightens people in Europe,"" Evans says.  ""If the United States is going to use extradition treaties to pull the chains on individuals who in this case are Chinese — is this something new?""",business
196,'Drastic actions' urged by UN agency as global average temperature rises higher,"The global average temperature is set to rise to at least 1.2 to 1.3 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels over the next five years, a World Meteorological Organization (WMO) official said on Monday, close to a limit adopted in a global treaty.  The prediction comes as governments are due to meet in New York for the UN Climate Action Summit to build on their pledges from the 2015 Paris Agreement, which aims to cap the global temperature rise at 1.5 degrees.  The agreement, adopted by almost 200 nations, set a goal of limiting warming to ""well below"" a rise of 2 C above pre-industrial times while ""pursuing efforts"" for the tougher 1.5 C goal.  A rise of 2 C is expected to wipe out more than 99 per cent of  coral reefs and melt most of the sea ice in the Arctic.  ""Basically we are on track to reach at least 1.2 to 1.3 degrees centigrade [above pre-industrial levels] over the next five years,"" Omar Baddour, WMO senior scientific officer, said in response to a Reuters question at a Geneva news conference.   ""It needs drastic actions,"" he added.    The comments came after the UN agency released a report on Sunday showing that the period from 2015 to 2019 was set to be the warmest five-year period on record, rising by 0.2 degrees Celsius over 2011-2015.  ""Not only are these statistics alarming they dispel any false sense of security that maybe we will muddle through this,"" said Maxx Dilley, director of the climate prediction and adaptation division of the WMO, told journalists.  ""There is going to have to be a dramatic scale up in the level of ambition and as well as in the level of actual follow through on the current policies that are intending to address this,"" he added.  The WMO report also showed record carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere recorded over the same period, with the pace of carbon dioxide growth up 20 per cent versus the last five-year assessment.  There is a lag in the period that the world's climate responds to carbon dioxide and other gasses, meaning that the emissions produced today can affect temperatures 20 years later, Dilley added, locking in the warming trend.",technology

6,Former Liberal MP Raj Grewal who left caucus over gambling addiction not running again,"Former Liberal MP Raj Grewal, who temporarily stepped away from federal politics last year to deal with a compulsive gambling problem, will not run in the upcoming federal election, CBC News has learned.  The Brampton East MP left the Liberal caucus last December, weeks after the Prime Minister's Office said he was receiving treatment from a health professional ""related to a gambling problem that led him to incur significant personal debts."" He sat as an Independent before Parliament was dissolved for the election.  The Globe and Mail reported at the time that Grewal had accumulated debt amounting to more than $1 million.  Grewal's debts and position as an MP — one who sat on the finance committee — prompted opposition politicians to question the government in the House of Commons about what it knew of Grewal's troubles and when.   ""We've learned that the gambling debts of the Liberal MP for Brampton East came to light as the result of a police wiretap,"" Conservative MP Mark Strahl said in November 2018, citing media reports.    ""The wiretaps were part of an OPP investigation into, quote, 'particularly shady guys' suspected of money laundering and terrorist financing. When did the Prime Minister's Office first learn about this serious investigation involving a sitting Liberal member of Parliament?""  NDP MP Nathan Cullen also grilled the government in the Commons, demanding answers about Grewal's time on the finance committee — especially the questions he asked senior RCMP witnesses about how they investigate money laundering.  ""The Liberal MP from Brampton East was appointed to the finance committee by the prime minister, where he asked troubling questions of senior law enforcement officials about how to avoid detection. This raised red flags with the RCMP,"" Cullen said.  Personal debts  CBC News reported that Grewal's most recent filing with the ethics commissioner's office at the time showed he had been carrying lines of credit with three separate banks: RBC, TD Bank and Scotiabank. He and another individual also held an HSBC mortgage.  His assets listed in the ethics filing included joint ownership of a residential investment property in Toronto.  That filing also showed Grewal had earned employment income from ZGemi Inc., a general contractor located in Brampton, and from the law firm Gahir &amp; Associates, on top of his MP's salary.  The ethics filing did not reveal the amounts owed on the lines of credit or the mortgage.  Grewal returning to legal practice  In early December, Grewal posted an 11-minute video to his Facebook page in which he addressed the allegations against him in the House of Commons and in a series of media reports.   The MP said he got into the habit of frequenting the Hilton hotel in Gatineau, Que., which houses the Lac-Leamy Casino.   What started as recreational blackjack spiraled into a ""significant problem,"" he said, as he accumulated gambling debts in high-stakes games over three years — debts he hid from his friends and family.   Grewal said he routinely borrowed from his loved ones to continue the pattern and no money was obtained illegally.    ""I want to make it clear, that every single personal loan made to me was by cheque. Everybody has been paid back, and every loan and repayment is transparent and traceable,"" he said in the video.  He said his problem gambling was hidden until early November, when he revealed his addiction to his family. Shortly after that, on Nov. 19, Grewal said he notified Trudeau's office about his mental-health issues.  Planned to resign and changed his mind  The PMO and Grewal initially said he would resign his seat.  ""Based on these circumstances, we agreed that his decision to resign as member of Parliament for Brampton East was the right one,"" the PMO statement said at the time. ""We hope he receives the support he needs.""  However, by the end of January this year he changed his mind and announced he would stay on as an Independent MP.   Grewal told CBC News Wednesday that he decided to serve out his term because that's what he promised his constituents. He said he is grateful for the support voters have shown him and will return to his private legal practice in Brampton after the election.",politics
207,Eco-anxiety spurs youth to take action on climate change,"This story is part of a CBC News series titled In Our Backyard, which looks at the effects climate change is having in Canada, from extreme weather events to how it's reshaping our economy.    Emma Lim, 18, announced this week that she's not going to have children until governments take serious action on climate change. The movement she launched spurred thousands more across Canada  to make a similar promise called the No Future pledge.   ""My generation is facing a future of economic instability, food scarcity, extreme weather events, and we, the children, are desperate,"" the McGill University student  said at a news conference in Ottawa on Monday.  Lim and other young people around the world are trying to get their voices heard. Led by the actions of 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg, thousands took to the streets on Friday with demonstrations across the globe — a precursor to the UN Youth Climate Summit starting in New York on Saturday.  With fires, floods, and pollution growing faster and more serious every year, children and young people are scared that they'll be bearing the brunt of this crisis. It's spawning a condition called eco-anxiety, a fear of environmental catastrophe. And while it's not officially recognized as a medical diagnosis, some experts say it's a real phenomenon.    ""The issues of the changing climate are reaching a sense of emergency as well as urgency,"" said Dr. Irena Buka, clinical professor of pediatrics at the University of Alberta.  She recently co-authored a position statement from the Canadian Paediatric Society on global climate change and Canadian children's health.  It listed for doctors a number of climate-related threats to children and their bodies. They included:     Heat and cold related deaths.   Air pollution.   Contaminated water.   Infections.    ""Now we have to start thinking about infections that don't normally reside or affect children in our region. We have to start thinking of things that we think existed only in warmer, tropical climates,"" Buka said.  In Oyster Bed, P.E.I., just outside of Charlottetown, university student Paige Martin is all too aware of the impact climate change may have on her community.  ""Sometimes you hear on the Island that the Island will be under water if we don't change our ways because we are such a small island and we are surrounded by water.""  Martin, her friends and her family are trying to do their part. Last spring,she founded a non-profit organization called Green Everlasting P.E.I. The group leads roadside cleanups, tree plantings, and tries to educate Islanders about what they can do to stop climate change.    ""It makes me feel a lot better because I don't feel like I'm doing nothing. I feel like I'm taking a step forward. I'm taking action,"" she said.  That sense of control is important to combat a sense of helplessness, according to Prof. Julia Woodhall-Melnik, a professor of sociology at the University of New Brunswick in Saint John.  She studied the mental health impact of two years of extreme flooding that hit the province starting in 2018, which was considered one of the worst years for flooding in recent memory.  Action alleviates anxiety  ""There was a lot of anxiety, a lot of stress. People were mentally and physically exhausted,"" she said.  Woodhall-Melnik said it rubbed off on the children, but many of them turned that anxiety into action, something she called ""post-traumatic growth.""  ""There were a lot of kids who really wanted to get out and help their communities. There were instances of moms taking their very young children, five, six, years old and bringing them to sandbag for their neighbours. So exposing them to community that way has a positive impact on well-being and community growth,"" she said.    Woodhall-Melnik applauds the position statement of the Canadian Paediatric Society.  ""If our youth are worrying or experiencing these extreme forms of anxiety we need to make sure that medical professionals, public health officers, even teachers are well equipped to step in and intervene, recognize the mental health concerns, and help them deal with it in a realistic way,"" she said.  Members of Lim's group, Climate Strike Canada, are hoping their pledge of not bringing more children into the world serves as a poignant wake-up call for action. Her mother, Catherine Cartman, a former lawyer who worked within the oil and gas industry, is still hoping that one day she will become a grandmother. But she understands her daughter's decision.  ""It is heartbreaking and horrifying to see our kids worry about something that until now we just took for granted,"" she said. ""We cannot let our children shoulder this burden alone.""",technology
77,"GM's Oshawa truck assembly line shut down, workers told to stay home as parts run short","Hundreds of GM workers in Oshawa were told to stay home Wednesday after a strike by auto workers in the U.S. limited the number of parts shipped to Canada, shutting down the truck assembly line at the plant.  Approximately 49,000 United Auto Workers in the U.S. went on strike against General Motors on Sunday night.     On Tuesday afternoon, 1,200 workers in Oshawa were told to go home. Another 650 workers on the morning shift were told they weren't needed on Wednesday.  A spokesperson for GM said approximately half of the production at the Oshawa plant was being affected by the UAW strike.  ""Some vehicles have been disrupted because of a lack of parts,"" David Paterson, GM's vice-president for corporate and environmental affairs, confirmed, explaining the company will continue to monitor the situation.  'They have to pay us regardless'  The Oshawa assembly plant is one of five North American plants closing at the end of the year. That means the workers sent home or told to stay away will be paid a full wage because of a contract stipulating all full-time employees must be paid for the last 16 weeks of work.  ""This affected GM more than it affected us — we're already prepared for the plant closure, and now because of the contract they have to pay us regardless,"" Peter Levesque, who opted to go home on Wednesday morning, told CBC News.     Unifor Local 222 union representative Mike Barry said his main concern is keeping everyone inside the Oshawa plant happy for now.  ""Our union has gone through great lengths with the company to make sure this isn't affecting us financially right now,"" Barry said.  ""We're just standing behind our brothers in the States — they've got a big fight ahead of them, but they can do it,"" he added.    Both the union and GM are watching two other plants in Ontario closely, but so far the assembly plant in Ingersoll and the engine and transmission plant in St. Catharines have been unaffected by the parts shortage.  However, Jerry Dias, president of Canadian union Unifor, said workers in St. Catharines could face layoffs within days, since about 80 per cent of the engines the plant builds are destined for cars assembled in the U.S.  At the Ingersoll assembly plant, about half the engines they put in cars come from the U.S. Dias estimates they may have to halt operations within 10 days.  GM has not said how many days of parts it has in reserve.",business
186,Sask. Ministry of Health watching for vaping-related illness,"The Saskatchewan Ministry of Health is now monitoring intensive care units across the province for vaping-related illness, but says there have been no cases in the province so far.  ""I am concerned with the recent incidents of vaping related illnesses, as well as the high rates of vaping we are seeing among Saskatchewan youth,"" Saskatchewan Health Minister Jim Reiter said in a release Friday.  ""Earlier this week I directed Saskatchewan public health officials to monitor all cases as they present in intensive care units.""  Any medical staff who encounter a severe respiratory episode that may be due to vaping are to report the incident immediately.  The move comes as vaping has been under scrutiny both in Canada and beyond. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had reported 530 confirmed and probable cases of lung injury related to e-cigarettes as of Sept. 17, including at least seven deaths.   An eighth death was reported by U.S. media outlets on Thursday.  Dr. Saqib Shahab of the Saskatchewan Health Authority said the question of whether vaping-related illnesses were passed off as something else is being explored in the United States.  ""There's two ways of looking at it: one is that vaping overall is a relatively recent phenomenon; over the last two to three years is when it's really picked up,"" he said.   ""Secondly the fact that many people have added cannabis products to vaping may also be something that's been happening.… That's also another line of inquiry that's going on in the U.S.""  Shahab said in many cases people admitted to hospital were using unregulated or tampered vaping devices.  He said a reporting process will be in place until medical professionals in Canada and the United States have a better understanding of the underlying risk factors.  Shahab said there's no reason for someone who's not already a smoker to take up vaping and cautioned against doing so.  This week, officials in Ontario said a teenager was put on life support after using a vaping device, in what public health officials say is the first reported case of illness linked to the practice in Canada.  And India banned e-cigarettes on Wednesday, saying the move was intended to ensure there was no ""vaping"" epidemic in the country.    Health Canada has issued a directive to health-care professionals here, telling them to ask patients about their vaping use and if they have any trouble breathing or shortness of breath.  In his Friday release, Reiter encouraged parents to talk with children about the potential risks associated with vaping.  According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, here are some symptoms to watch for if you, or someone you know, is vaping:     Breathing difficulty.   Shortness of breath.   Chest pain before hospitalization.   Mild to moderate gastrointestinal illness including vomiting and diarrhea.   Other symptoms such as fevers or fatigue.",health
175,Diabetes drug victims demand justice in French trial,"Victims of a diabetes drug suspected in hundreds of deaths pleaded for justice as a massive trial involving more than 4,000 plaintiffs opened Monday for French pharmaceutical giant Servier Laboratoires and France's medicines watchdog.  The company and the oversight body stand accused of involuntary manslaughter, fraud and other charges in their handling of the drug Mediator.  ""My life is just not the same,"" said Paquita Guardiola, who suffered severe health complications requiring a heart transplant after taking the drug. ""Now it's hard for me to even get dressed. My children dress me, my husband dresses me. He helps me in the shower, he does everything.""  Although marketed as a diabetes drug, Mediator was also prescribed as a hunger suppressant and was taken by millions of people before sales were suspended in France in 2009.  A 2010 study said Mediator was suspected in 1,000-2,000 deaths, with doctors linking it to heart and lung problems.    The drug has never been reviewed or approved for use in Canada, Health Canada said in a statement to CBC News.  The closely watched trial that opened in Paris is expected to last six months and is one of France's biggest in years.  The trial dossier runs to nearly 700 pages — with around 300 pages taken up by plaintiffs' names. The trial was spread across five rooms, connected by video-link, at the Paris courthouse. Nearly 400 lawyers were working on the case.  Guardiola, who has already received compensation from Servier, will testify as a witness. She said the drugmaker ""ruined my life.""  Irene Frachon, a lung specialist who was among the first in France to sound the alarm about Mediator, said the scandal could not be simply brushed aside.    ""You can't 'Put it behind you' when 2,000 people died,"" she said. ""I'm really counting on this criminal case to put an end to this collective blindness to white collar crimes, especially with regards to what I call pharma-criminality.""  She added: ""Whatever the financial stakes, there are red lines that need to be redrawn and that's why this trial is crucial.""    Investigating magistrates concluded that Servier for decades covered up Mediator's harmful effects on patients. The national medicines agency is suspected of colluding in masking its dangers.  Francois de Castro, a lawyer for Servier, said the pharmaceutical firm wasn't aware of risks associated with Mediator before 2009 — 33 years after it first went on sale.  Company faces manslaughter and fraud charges   Speaking at the courthouse, the president of Servier, Olivier Laureau, expressed ""our deepest and sincerest regrets"" to ""the patients who have suffered from Mediator"" and ""to their families who have gone through a tragedy.""  Servier is being tried on charges of manslaughter, unintentional harm, fraud and deceit about the chemical makeup of Mediator and the risks of taking it.    France's medicines agency, meanwhile reformed and renamed, is also accused of manslaughter by negligence and causing unintentional harm.  Also on trial are 12 representatives of the pharma giant and the medicines agency.  ""This trial is a victory for the victims,"" said Dominique-Michel Courtois, head of a Mediator victims group. He said they want answers on how Servier obtained a license to market the drug and how it ""hoodwinked the authorities.""  Headquartered in a suburb of Paris, Servier employs 22,000 people worldwide.  With files from CBC News",health
99,"We've lost 3 billion birds since 1970, study shows","There are nearly three billion fewer birds in Canada and the United States than there were half a century ago, a new study estimates.  It counted a loss of 2.9 billion birds compared with 1970, which represents a population decline of 29 per cent and an ""overlooked biodiversity crisis,"" said the report published Thursday in the journal Science.  ""I was stunned,"" said Ken Rosenberg, the lead author. ""I couldn't believe that there was that magnitude of a net change.""  Rosenberg is a conservation scientist at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the American Bird Conservancy.   His study with Canadian and U.S. collaborators combined population data from more than 500 species going back half a century. It also includes a decade of weather radar data that measures the mass of migrating birds, and found a 14 per cent decline over that time.    The study found that the vast majority of the birds that have disappeared aren't rare or vulnerable endangered species, but include many familiar backyard birds like sparrows, juncos, and starlings considered common and abundant.  ""That is what is such a strong indicator that something is wrong in these habitats and environments,"" Rosenberg said. ""This loss of abundance is so pervasive that it's the old canary in a coal mine — it's almost certainly an indicator of a degradation of overall environmental quality that's ultimately going to affect people.""  The study noted that birds provide important benefits to ecosystems, such as pest control, pollination and seed dispersal, and warned that common birds may be disproportionately important parts of the food web and local ecosystems.  Previous reports, such as the State of Canada's Birds earlier this year, showed that some groups of birds, including grassland birds and shorebirds such as plovers and sandpipers, have declining populations. A report on the State of North America's birds in 2016 had even estimated that bird populations had declined by a billion since 1970.   Andrew Couturier, a senior director with Bird Studies Canada, one of the groups that produced those reports, said those reports were based on relative population changes rather than actual counts. He's confident in the improved estimate based on improved and refined data and methods, which Bird Studies Canada was not involved in.  Couturier called the new estimate ""shocking"" but says it matches up with what many people have reported anecdotally: ""This is kind of confirming what we've noticed.""   Previous studies also showed that some groups of birds, such as waterfowl and birds of prey, were increasing, largely due to conservation measures.    Rosenberg thought an actual count of bird populations in North America over time might show growing populations for some species partly compensating for population losses among declining species, many of which are rare to begin with.  To his surprise, that wasn't the case. The new study showed even birds such as house sparrows and starlings, which were introduced from Europe, do well in cities, and have typically out-competed native birds, are disappearing — their populations are down 331 million and 83 million, respectively, since 1970.      People love birds. There's an army of people out there who love to go out and do these surveys and count birds.  - Ken Rosenberg, lead author     Rosenberg said even backyard birds that aren't choosy about their habitats can be affected by degradation such as intensifying agriculture, urban sprawl, and fragmentation of forests. They also face other human-caused threats, such as increased pesticide use, domestic cats, and collisions with windows.   ""It's what we call death by a thousand cuts,"" Rosenberg said.  The report found native sparrows, warblers and blackbirds have seen some of the biggest population declines, in the hundreds of millions of individuals.    Paul Smith, a research scientist with Environment and Climate Change Canada who co-authored the paper, said those aren't necessarily the most worrying declines: ""They're just the largest in magnitude, because those species started with large population sizes.""  Birds that migrate long distances, such as those shorebirds that Smith studies and many of those that breed in Canada's Arctic or boreal forest but spend winters in Central and South America, have been particularly hard hit. Migrating species declined by 2.5 billion individuals, faring much worse than those that stay put year round, that increased slightly, by 26 million.  ""Canada, and in particular Arctic Canada, is the breeding range for a lot of North America's shorebirds. So really Canada has a huge responsibility for the conservation of these birds.""    The study points out that conservation has brought back populations of waterfowl.  ""What we've found,"" said Smith, ""is when we've put our mind to it, we've been able to recover species.""  That said, Couturier noted that 80 per cent of Canada's birds spend part of the year outside the country, meaning that we need to work with partners in the U.S., Mexico and Central and South America.   Beyond birds  Birds are particularly good indicators of ecosystem health as they are easier to monitor than another other group of animals, the researchers note. They're active during the day, and are conspicuous, making it possible for people to both see and hear them, Rosenberg said, unlike many insects, lizards or mammals.  The population estimates in the study largely made use of data collected by volunteers or ""citizen scientists"" during standardized annual surveys, especially the Breeding Bird Survey, which has been running since 1966, coordinated by Environment and Climate Change Canada's Canadian Wildlife Service, the U.S. Geological Survey, and Mexico's National Commission for Knowledge and the Use of Biodiversity.    ""People love birds,"" Rosenberg said. ""There's an army of people out there who love to go out and do these surveys and count birds.""  Bridget Stutchbury, a York University professor of conservation biology and ecology who studies migratory songbirds in North America but was not involved in the study, called the results ""alarming.""   ""This is the first ever 'big picture' of overall bird losses, and it uses two independent data sets to make the case that we are still in the midst of a bird decline crisis,"" she said in an email.  However, she noted the study wasn't designed to address the root causes.  ""So while it is a call to arms, it's a bit unclear what new or stronger direction we should take as a society.""  The researchers and the bird conservation and research groups they belong to do offer suggestions for individual and policy actions that could help through their website 3billionbirds.org.    A UN report earlier this year found not just birds are in decline: one million species of plants and animals are at risk of extinction, half of them due to ""insufficient habitat for long-term survival."" Kai Chan, a professor at the Institute for Resources, Environment and Sustainability at the University of British Columbia who co-authored the report, said the new study had more precise population estimates for birds.  And while it doesn't directly say anything about the decline in other species, what is bad for birds is often bad for other animals, and some of the bird declines may be reflecting the decline in prey species such as insects.  ""It further confirms what we already know,"" he said in an email. ""The big picture is very concerning.""    Other studies have looked at recent declines in groups such as amphibians and insects. One recent report showed that many bumblebee species are declining in Canada.Victoria MacPhail, a bee specialist at York University and lead author of that report, said she was ""equal parts shocked and not all that surprised"" by the bird population decline.  She said monitoring populations of animals needs to continue, and the public can help by participating in citizen science.  ""But we also need to take action on the ground with increased conservation efforts and behaviour changes and in the halls of government, with changes in policy and regulations and even an increase in funding support: simply lamenting the loss of our biodiversity will not cause anything to change.""",technology
202,Banks tell dozens of customers they're to blame for thousands of dollars lost to e-transfer fraudsters,"A Manitoba man says marketing that claims people are protected when they e-transfer money is misleading, after fraudsters stole $3,000 and TD Bank said he was to blame.  Rene Trudeau e-transferred the maximum his bank allowed — $3,000 — to a contractor who installed a new front door on his home in February. He then e-transferred the remaining $300 owed and texted the contractor to let him know he'd been paid in full.   The contractor texted back, saying he didn't get the e-transfers and hadn't seen a dime.  ""I kind of panic,"" Trudeau told Go Public from his home in Île-des-Chênes, just outside Winnipeg. ""Because at this point, all $3,300 is gone from my account.""  Trudeau is one of dozens of people who contacted Go Public after a recent story about e-transfer fraud — all describing frustrating battles with their banks and questioning why exemptions that leave them on the hook when fraudsters strike are buried in the fine print of electronic banking agreements.      Been wronged and you're not the only one affected? Contact the Go Public team     A police detective with Toronto's cybercrime unit says because e-transfer fraud is on the rise, financial institutions need to do a better job of informing customers about risks and how they can better protect themselves.  ""They [banks] want to be good corporate citizens,"" said Det. Const. Kenrick Bagnall. ""They should … be more proactive.""  As soon as Trudeau realized something was wrong, he contacted TD Bank and an employee was able to stop the $300 e-transfer from leaving his account. But the earlier $3,000 was gone.  That was the beginning of a seven-month battle with TD, to try to track his money and get it back.  ""When I asked where the money went, or how did this happen, they seemed more interested in absolving themselves of the responsibility for this fraud,"" said Trudeau. ""Customer service was atrocious.""  He says it took three weeks before someone in TD's Customer Care department told him his money had been redirected to another chartered bank — which TD wouldn't name — and more than 10 weeks for TD to provide the RCMP with the financial information necessary to investigate.    Protection requirements in fine print  TD said the fraud occurred after a someone hacked into the contractor's email and correctly answered Trudeau's security question, which was ""What is your wife's name?""   Because it wasn't hard for the fraudster to figure out the answer — the contractor named his wife on his Facebook page — TD said Trudeau was to blame, pointing to a clause on page four of the bank's electronic financial terms and conditions.  The agreement is similar to those in place at all the big banks and says customers must use tough security questions with answers only the sender and recipient can guess.       The system is not as secure as they say.  — Rene Trudeau, e-transfer fraud victim     Trudeau admits his security question was weak, but says TD's marketing claims that customers who use e-transfer are ""protected"" and their money is ""secure,"" so it hadn't occurred to him that fraudsters could hack emails and redirect an e-transfer.  ""They [banks] should be acknowledging that the system is not as secure as they say it is,"" Trudeau said.   Most customers not reimbursed  Dozens of other people have recently contacted Go Public, describing how they, too, felt misled by their financial institutions after fraudsters diverted their e-transfer funds.   They point to how financial institutions market the convenience of e-transfers and make claims in bold print that the system is safe.     In smaller print — or, buried in online agreements — banks and credit unions outline a list of requirements a customer must meet in order to actually be protected, should something happen to their money.   ""They don't want to scare people away from using the service — which has a significant payoff for them,"" said Trudeau. ""It's quite frustrating.""  All told, Go Public has learned about fraudsters using e-transfer to steal almost $64,000 from 56 people with accounts at TD, CIBC, Royal Bank, Scotiabank, Tangerine, Simplii, HSBC, Assiniboine Credit Union and Kawartha Credit Union.   Customers did not get their money back in almost three-quarters of the cases:     Neil Joshi, a Toronto teacher, lost $2,790 after he e-transferred a payment to his HVAC contractor, but it was intercepted by a fraudster. Neither his nor the intended recipient's bank will reimburse the stolen funds. ""What I find remarkable is that none of these banks seem to be taking any measures to address this type of security issue,"" wrote Joshi to Go Public. ""Their attitude was, 'As long as we're not on the hook for the funds … it's not our problem.'""   Tim Smith of Fort St. John, B.C., wrote to say that he lost over $5,300 after his e-transfer to his carpenter was intercepted, and his bank blamed weak email security. ""They [banks] hold immense amounts of money in trust for the public and if their protocol is no better than that, they don't deserve to be in business.""   Contractor Jeff Harney of North Vancouver was supposed to receive a $1,500 e-transfer from a client, but his email was hacked and his bank refused to compensate for the loss. ""My disappointment with the system is that the BIG PRINT says ZERO LIABILITY and RISK-FREE but the small print negates them of all responsibility,"" he wrote.    Watch: Are e-transfers a safe way to send money?     Banks require gag orders  After Go Public contacted TD Bank earlier this month about Trudeau, the bank reached out to him again.   Trudeau says they have now come to a ""satisfactory agreement,"" but he's not allowed to share details, because TD required him to sign a confidentiality agreement.  TD declined to address Go Public's questions about where Trudeau's $3,000 e-transfer went, or why it took seven months to resolve the problem.   In an emailed statement to Go Public, TD's manager of corporate and public affairs Carla Hindman wrote: ""We have co-operated with the police investigation and have resolved this concern with our customer.""      After Go Public contacted TD Bank about Trudeau's complaint, the bank published tips on preventing e-transfer fraud    In another e-transfer dispute, CIBC required a gag order before offering customer Charlotte Mustard $1,000 as a ""gesture of goodwill"" after $3,000 she transferred to pay for a new furnace in her Peterborough, Ont., home was stolen.  ""That is the part that really got me,"" says Mustard. ""It was like they [CIBC] were saying, 'Here, take this money and go away and be quiet and don't bother us anymore.' Where's the goodwill in that? And where is the justice?""  She refused to sign the confidentiality agreement and contacted Go Public. ""It's very important for me to be heard — as a woman, as a senior. And I was not heard by the CIBC at all. As a matter of fact, I felt very, very discounted.""  CIBC's senior consultant for public affairs, Crystal Jongeward, told Go Public in an email, ""We're continuing to work with the bank that received the funds to resolve the matter for our client."" The theft occurred last January.  Frauds reported 'tip of the iceberg'  Go Public requested an interview with the Canadian Bankers Association (CBA) to discuss why banks don't do more to educate customers about the importance of strong email security to protect against e-transfer fraud.   CBA spokesperson Mathieu Labrèche declined to be interviewed but said in a statement that banks widely publish information and tips about scams and provide electronic access agreements ""wherein customers commit to using passwords and security questions that are unique and cannot be easily guessed or obtained by others.""    Bagnall, the Toronto detective, says Canada's banks need to do much more to warn customers about potential risks when using e-transfers, because the frauds being reported are ""the tip of the iceberg.""  He said financial institutions may not be reporting fraud because it can cause ""reputational harm.""  ""If customers start leaving … that could very much affect their business,"" said Bagnall. ""Damage to the brand is a huge reason why organizations are not reporting cybercrime to the police.""  Bagnall says there's also no requirement for the banks to report e-transfer crime to the police.    ""They're so large that there's not really a reason that they need to be transparent, because they can do their own internal investigations,"" he said. ""They really only need to report to the privacy commissioner.""  Trudeau says the battle with his bank was exhausting, frustrating and has changed his online banking habits.  He says he'll never again e-transfer a large amount of money — $20 is now his limit.       Submit your story ideas   Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

114,Scientists sound alarm over Alberta's new approach to tracking oilsands pollution,"The scientist who once oversaw the science division of an independent agency keeping tabs on the impact of industrial pollution in Alberta is leaving the province and speaking out about the politics that he says has come to permeate Alberta's petroleum-based economy.  Bill Donahue says he fears the quality and depth of environmental monitoring in the province will continue to decline, imperilling the public's understanding of potentially harmful pollutants produced by the oilsands and related industries.  Last week, staff at Alberta Environment and Parks were informed that the Environmental Monitoring and Science Division (EMSD), which Donahue once helped lead, was being dissolved and rolled into a new structure. A stand-alone climate change office will also disappear.  ""In my experience, it'll result in significant disruption of programs. Possibly more cuts in budgets. Lack of focus. Fractured scientific leadership. That sort of thing,""  Donahue said in an interview with CBC News.  ""If you don't have adequate or appropriate monitoring, you won't ever be able to tell whether your decisions are effective, whether policies are achieving their goals.""    Donahue said environmental monitoring in Alberta had already been weakened under the previous NDP government, which eliminated the independent Alberta Environmental Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting Agency (AEMERA). Donahue, who has a scientific and legal background, was also vice-president and chief monitoring officer at AEMERA.  Failure to properly monitor led to global scrutiny  The province was pushed into establishing an independent agency in 2014 after a team led by University of Alberta scientist David Schindler found that pollution from the oilsands was not being properly detected, leading to widespread criticism from environmental organizations.  Schindler, now retired, said that as the oilsands were being developed in the 1970s and '80s, Progressive Conservative governments constantly reassured the public that there was no problem with pollution. When he and a group of scientists conducted their own independent research, they found that government monitoring had been ineffective and politically influenced.  ""The problem in the past has been that the political thumb has been on the science, ensuring that there was never adequate science done,"" he said.   The new structure that has government overseeing monitoring threatens to tip the scale back to the past, Schindler said.  ""Anything that could possibly be wrong in the oilsands is now subject to political censorship, so that the public at large will not know whether what they're hearing is straight propaganda or the truth.""      Oilsands monitoring needs scientific rigour: panel   Alberta, Canada launch joint oilsands monitoring system   Environment minister defends dismantling arm's-length industry monitor    Because Alberta's economy is so dependent on oil, governments of all political brands have been boosters of the industry. Premier Jason Kenney, elected last April, is currently in the U.S. trying to attract new investment in the province's oil business.  A key part of his messaging is that Alberta produces the cleanest, most ethical heavy oil in the world. Among Kenney's first moves as premier was to establish a ""war room"" to challenge news stories and battle critics of the industry. He's also set up a $2.5-million public inquiry to investigate foreign funding of groups opposing the oilsands.    Donahue said he finds it telling that the Kenney government is spending more on battling opposition to the oilsands than it is on monitoring its environmental impacts.  ""I guess that tells me where the priority of monitoring and science is,"" he said. ""If you put more money into attacking environmentalists and, you know, chasing these conspiracy theories and probably disinforming and misinforming the public than you do putting it into programs that actually reveal whether or not there are actually significant problems, that needs to be addressed or mitigated.""  Alberta Environment Minister Jason Nixon was unavailable for comment. But in a statement sent to CBC News, his department said the reorganization will make oilsands monitoring more effective.  The new division ""will allow for increased collaboration and capacity among scientists working on fish and wildlife, environmental monitoring and science, flood forecasting, cumulative effects modelling and other areas,"" it said.  The Alberta government says it has no intention of reducing the amount it spends on monitoring, which was about $20.4 million last year under the EMSD. The federal government and the oilsands industry also contribute to monitoring",technology
112,"Trump administration, California headed for pitched battle on auto mileage standards","President Donald Trump announced Wednesday that his administration is revoking California's authority to set auto mileage standards stricter than those issued by federal regulators.  In a tweet, Trump said his move would result in less expensive and safer cars. He insisted that new cars would be cleaner, even as they burn more gasoline than they would have under the Obama-era fuel efficiency standards.  ""Many more cars will be produced under the new and uniform standard, meaning significantly more JOBS, JOBS, JOBS! Automakers should seize this opportunity because without this alternative to California, you will be out of business,"" Trump tweeted, a claim that Gavin Newsom, California's Democratic governor, quickly pushed back against.  Trump's move comes after the Justice Department opened an antitrust investigation into a deal between California and four automakers for tougher pollution and related mileage requirements than those sought by Trump. Trump also has sought to relax federal mileage standards nationwide, weakening a key effort by his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama to slow climate change.  California, in addition to environmental groups, vowed to fight the latest plans from Washington through the courts.      We cannot afford to backslide in our battle against climate change.  - Xavier Becerra, California's attorney general     ""We cannot afford to backslide in our battle against climate change,"" said Xavier Becerra, the state's attorney general, at a news conference.  ""We have the law, facts and science on our side,"" added Newsom, at the same news briefing.    U.S. automakers contend that without a substantial increase in fuel efficiency, their vehicles will be less competitive globally, which could potentially result in job losses.  ""Automakers support year-over-year increases in fuel economy standards that align with marketplace realities, and we support one national program as the best path to preserve good auto jobs, keep new vehicles affordable for more Americans and avoid a marketplace with different standards,"" said Dave Schwietert, the interim CEO and president of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which represents Ford, General Motors and other leading U.S. automakers.  Emissions standards are closely linked with fuel economy requirements because vehicles pollute less if they burn fewer gallons of fuel.    Mary Nichols, chair of the California Air Resources Board, said the Trump administration move flies in the face of an industry increasingly investing in electric vehicles.  ""This is the fight of a lifetime for us — we have to win this, and I think we will,"" she said.      It's about the oil industry, period. Full stop.  - California Gov. Gavin Newsom     Nichols and Newsom both noted how the Republicans are usually vociferous in their support of state's rights.  ""I don't know what the hell's happening to the Republican Party,"" said Newsom.  EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler told the National Automobile Dealers Association on Tuesday the agency's goal is to establish one nationwide set of fuel-economy standards.  ""We embrace federalism and the role of the states, but federalism does not mean that one state can dictate standards for the nation,"" Wheeler said, adding that higher fuel economy standards would hurt consumers by increasing the average sticker price of new cars and requiring automakers to produce more electric vehicles.  Waivers never rejected, California says  California's authority to set its own tougher emissions standards goes back to a waiver issued by Congress during passage of the Clean Air Act in 1970, under the administration of Republican Richard Nixon. The state has long pushed automakers to adopt more fuel-efficient passenger vehicles that emit less pollution. A dozen states and the District of Columbia also follow California's fuel economy standards.  Becerra noted the unprecedented nature of the fight since that time, even as Democratic governors such as Jerry Brown and Gray Davis served while Republican administrations were in power in Washington.  ""We have been granted 100 waivers. Never has one been rejected,"" he said.  Newsom, admitting his ""deep frustration,"" cited the support from the auto industry and accused the administration of kowtowing to special interests.  ""It's about the oil industry, period. Full stop,"" he said, noting the opposition of oil companies through the years to the waiver granted to California.  The deal struck in July between California and four of the world's largest automakers — Ford, Honda, BMW and Volkswagen — bypassed the Trump administration's plan to freeze emissions and fuel economy standards adopted under Obama at 2021 levels.  The four automakers agreed with California to reduce emissions by 3.7 per cent per year starting with the 2022 model year, through 2026. That compares with 4.7 per cent yearly reductions through 2025 under the Obama standards.    It's not clear yet what the Trump administration will propose as its final fuel-efficiency rules, but in the past it has favoured freezing Obama-era mileage standards at 2021 levels. Under the Obama administration requirements, the fleet of new vehicles would have to average 30 miles per gallon (13 kilometres per litre) in real-world driving by 2021, rising to 36 mpg (15.3 kmu002FL) in 2025. Currently the standard is 26 mpg (11 kmu002FL).  The U.S. transportation sector is the nation's biggest single source of planet-warming greenhouse gases. Becerra said in California, transportation use accounts for 29 per cent of the greenhouse gas total.  The EPA's Wheeler said Tuesday: ""California will be able to keep in place and enforce programs to address smog and other forms of air pollution caused by motor vehicles."" But fuel economy has been one of the key regulatory tools the state has used to reduce harmful emissions.  Environmentalists condemned the Trump administration's move, which comes as gasoline prices have crept higher following a weekend drone attack that hobbled Saudi Arabian oil output.  ""Everyone wins when we adopt strong clean car standards as our public policy,"" said Fred Krupp, president of Environmental Defence Fund. ""Strong clean car standards give us healthier air to breathe, help protect us from the urgent threat of climate change and save Americans hundreds of dollars a year in gas expenses.""  Under Trump, the EPA contends that freezing the fuel economy standards will reduce the average sticker price of new vehicles by about $2,700 US by 2025, though that predicted savings is disputed by environmental groups and is more than double the EPA estimates from the prior administration.  Trump's tweet does not address the money consumers would save at the gas pump if cars got better mileage. A study released by Consumer Reports in August found that the owner of a 2026 vehicle will pay over $3,300 more for gasoline during the life of a vehicle if the standards are frozen at 2021 levels.  Trump's announcement on Wednesday came about an hour after after an Environmental Protection Agency spokesperson said, when asked about the subject by The Associated Press, ""We have nothing to announce at this time.""",technology
26,Vancouver mayor calls on federal leaders to act on overdose crisis,"The mayor of Vancouver says the city that opened North America's first supervised injection site following a surge in heroin-related deaths wants all federal party leaders to consider a proposal to allow substance users access to pharmaceutical-grade heroin.  Kennedy Stewart is aiming for a Health Canada exemption from federal drug laws so diacetylmorphine, a safe substitute opioid, could be distributed through a non-profit organization to prevent overdose deaths from potentially dangerous drugs laced with fentanyl.  ""We have thousands of addicts in this city and I think the scale of the problem just isn't understood,"" he said in a recent interview.  Stewart said he has had informal talks with three of the four major party leaders: Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau, the NDP's Jagmeet Singh, and Green Leader Elizabeth May. He has tried to set up a meeting with Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer.    Insite, a Vancouver facility where people shoot up their own substances under medical supervision, opened in 2003 with an exemption from drug laws by the Liberal government after intense lobbying by health officials, drug users, and local and provincial politicians.  The Conservative government led by Stephen Harper vigorously opposed the site, saying it fostered addiction. The Tories fought to shut it down before losing a Supreme Court of Canada battle in 2011.    Since then, eight more supervised injection sites have opened in British Columbia. Alberta now has eight sites, Ontario is home to 22 and Quebec has opened four of them, all in Montreal, says Health Canada, which is considering four more applications from Ontario, two from Alberta and one each from Saskatchewan and Manitoba.  'Extremely dangerous substances'  Scheer's press secretary, Daniel Schow, said the Conservative party does not support supervised injection sites, safer opioids or decriminalization.  ""It is tragic that we have failed these Canadians to the point where drug injection sites are often the only focus of discussion instead of a comprehensive approach to addiction,"" Schow said in a statement.  ""Drugs such as heroin, crack cocaine, and meth are extremely dangerous substances that tear families apart and have lasting effects on individuals who choose to consume them.""  Singh said on the second day of the election campaign that people struggling with addiction should get health care for a chronic condition and not be criminalized if their drugs are for personal use.    ""Thousands of Canadians are dying and we've got to do things differently,"" he said during a stop in Brampton, Ont., adding that mental health issues must also be treated.  ""We can't continue down the same path. If we want to change the results we've got to change our approach.""  May also stressed the need to address the opioid crisis as a health-care issue and called for the declaration of a national health emergency.    ""Drug possession should be decriminalized, ensuring people have access to a screened supply and the medical support they need to combat their addiction,"" she said in a statement.  Trudeau has said no to decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of drugs for personal use.  'This is exactly what we need'  Data from the BC Coroners Service show that between 2016 and June 2019, over a quarter of the 4,559 overdose deaths in British Columbia occurred in Vancouver, the city hit hardest in Canada by the opioid epidemic. Statistics by the Public Health Agency in June showed 11,577 people died across the country from opioid-related overdoses between June 2016 and December 2018.  Stewart said providing a safer supply of drugs to people who are struggling with addiction is an innovative and practical response to the overdose crisis.  He said he isn't pursuing decriminalization as an option because it's a toxic drug supply that's killing people.    ""I don't need that kind of massive policy change to reduce overdoses here in the city. What I need is a federal health exemption. That's it,"" he said.  Dr. Keith Ahamad, an addiction specialist at St. Paul's Hospital in downtown Vancouver, wants illegal drugs to be regulated.  ""(Trudeau) has previously used that exact argument for creating a regulatory framework for cannabis in Canada and this is exactly what we need to do for other substances.""    Reducing stigma  Decriminalization is also important in reducing stigma against drug users so they don't fear getting help for their addiction and should include education, social supports and treatment through the health-care system, which has made Portugal's decriminalization model a success, Ahamad said.  ""In Canada we have a system right now where the vast majority of addiction care is being provided by unskilled and sometimes lay people. It's not regulated,"" he said.  ""It's an election issue because currently we are hemorrhaging money into the downstream consequences of bad drug policy and prohibition. Overdoses and overdose deaths and all of the money that we're pouring into all of that right now is really a direct cause of bad drug policy.""    Donald MacPherson, director of the Canadian Drug Policy Coalition at B.C.'s Simon Fraser University, said the overdose death toll demands a quick response through a safe supply of drugs that could be distributed through pharmacies, community health clinics and overdose prevention sites.  ""It's great that Conservatives advocate for expanding treatment. So do all the other parties and so do people who advocate for safe supply. You just need it all at this point,"" said MacPherson, who worked as the first municipal drug policy co-ordinator in North America when he held the post in Vancouver between 2000 and 2009.  Regulating illegal drugs would take years if a government was willing bring in legislation but providing safer drugs is critical during the overdose crisis, he said.",health
79,'You must be very careful': Common questions about CBD health claims for pain and other conditions answered,"Cannabidiol, or CBD oil, is promoted for a wide range of medical conditions. Recently, a review for doctors weighed the science behind the claims.  The Clinicians' Guide to Cannabidiol and Hemp Oils was published earlier this month in the journal Mayo Clinic Proceedings.  CBD is a compound found in the cannabis plant. It is not intoxicating, Health Canada said.  As of October 2018, the sale of dried cannabis, fresh cannabis, cannabis oil, cannabis plants and cannabis seeds are permitted under the the Cannabis Act.  As consumer interest in CBD grows ahead of the Oct. 17 legalization of cannabis edibles, extracts and topicals, here's a primer to answer common questions about its health claims for seizures, pain and other conditions.  What is CBD approved to treat?  Epidiolex, a purified form of plant-based CBD, is the only CBD-related treatment approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is used to treat severe forms of epilepsy. Epidiolex isn't listed in Health Canada's database of medications approved for use in this country.  Health Canada assigns a drug identification number (DIN) to all drug products evaluated and authorized for sale in this country. To qualify, a drug manufacturer needs to provide information including dosing, strength and how it's taken.  ""Currently, there are two cannabis-related drugs that have a DIN and are authorized for sale in Canada,"" a spokesperson for Health Canada said in an email.   Nabilone, a synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, product is approved to treat nausea. THC is the main psychoactive component in cannabis that gives users a high.   The other drug with a DIN is Sativex, which is manufactured from whole botanical extracts and contains THC and CBD, according to Health Canada. Sativex is added to treatments aimed at relieving spasticity in adults with multiple sclerosis. Spasticity is a muscle-control disorder.  No CBD-specific product has a DIN.  As well, no other ""cannabis-related drug (including fresh or dried marijuana or cannabis oil) has been approved to be marketed as a drug for therapeutic use and sale in Canada,"" Health Canada said.   What is CBD commonly used for?  There are anecdotal reports from users of CBD helping with certain types of pain, such as nerve-related back pain.  ""Chronic pain management continues to challenge patients and physicians alike, and investigation into potential therapies such as CBD and hemp oils is a promising area for the future of clinical pain management for both pain relief as well as addiction management,"" Dr. Karen Mauck, an internist at Mayo Clinic, and her co-authors wrote.  Dr. Hance Clarke, director of pain services at Toronto General Hospital who wasn't involved in the U.S. paper, said he starts by asking patients what symptoms they want to use CBD to treat.      It's one of the first times in Canadian history where a medication has made it to the population without the science actually leading us there.  - Dr. Hance Clarke, director of pain services at Toronto General Hospital     ""The evidence has not caught up to the story that's in the public,"" Clarke said. ""It's tricky. It's one of the first times in Canadian history where a medication has made it to the population without the science actually leading us there.""    Physicians need to work with patients to figure out what people are using, the levels in their body and what's actually helped and what hasn't.  ""The world is looking to Canada over the next five to 10 years,"" Clarke said. An evidence-based perspective on cannabis is needed rather than solely industry's, he said.  Canada's Arthritis Society said there's limited clinical evidence so far on the relative benefits and risks of medical cannabis to treat osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.       CBD now is widely used by people for all kinds of disease, in particular anxiety, panic attack, bipolar disorder, depression. But we don't know if CBD is really good for these kind of diseases.  - Dr. Gabriella Gobbi     In January, research into CBD's effects on pain and anxiety in lab rats was published in the scientific journal Pain.  ""CBD now is widely used by people for all kinds of disease, in particular anxiety, panic attack, bipolar disorder, depression,"" said Dr. Gabriella Gobbi, the study's author and a psychiatrist at McGill University's faculty of medicine in Montreal. ""But we don't know if CBD is really good for these kinds of diseases.""  Only clinical trials in humans can show if CBD is really effective for an illness, Gobbi said.  In Canada, pharmaceutical companies are sponsoring clinical trials to test CBD products in people.  How do you know what's in the product?  Depending on what part of the plant is extracted, different components will be present in the oil, the Mayo Clinic authors said. Their list of what clinicians should look for include:     Manufacturing standards certification, such as pesticide or herbicide testing.   European Union, Australian or Canadian organic certification.   Lab testing to confirm cannabinoid levels and the absence of heavy metals.    ""We see variations from batch to batch where patients are doing well on something, and potentially the next time they seek that same product, potentially they're not seeing the same effects,"" Clarke said.  A research letter published in 2017 in JAMA  found nearly 70 per cent of CBD extracts sold online were mislabelled.  ""A lot of CBD oil can have very little or contain lots of THC, so you must be very careful,"" Gobbi said. ""We need more quality control.""  What side-effects have been reported?  In larger studies on CBD treatment for epileptic patients, it was associated with drowsiness, decreased appetite and diarrhea in up to 36 per cent of people, the Mayo Clinic authors said, adding the side-effects were less severe and frequent compared with a conventional anticonvulsant medication.    The FDA said its review of a marketing application for Epidiolex suggested potential for liver injury associated with CBD.      You can't just self-treat.  - Dr. Gabriella Gobbi     ""You can't just self-treat,"" Gobbi said.  What about drug interactions?  The main drug interactions doctors and pharmacists look for are drugs, such as morphine, oxycodone, sleeping pills, antidepressants or antipsychotics, that already make you sleepy, confused or impair co-ordination.  ""If you're taking those medications to begin with and you use cannabis, we'd expect that those side effects would get worse,"" said Kelly Grindrod of the University of Waterloo's School of Pharmacy.    People should talk to their physician, nurse or pharmacist to discuss potential drug interactions when determining whether to try CBD.  Maddie Brown, a registered practical nurse and cannabis consultant based in Ottawa, helps patients with medical cannabis prescriptions understand how CBD works and obtain it.  ""I'm definitely most concerned about blood thinners,"" Brown told CBC Radio's White Coat, Black Art. ""CBD can make Coumadin [a blood thinning medication] more potent.""  The general advice is to start low and go slow, especially if taking medications that are known to interact, Grindrod said.",health
201,Here are some small towns and cities where you can get a well-paying tech job,"Greg Malpass grew up in picturesque Nelson, B.C., a town of around 10,000 nestled in the Selkirk Mountains along Kootenay Lake.  Known for its skiing and hiking, as well as its vibrant arts scene and eclectic array of cafés, stores and microbreweries, it's the kind of small town where city-weary people dream of living — if only they could find a job.  Originally settled during a gold and silver mining boom, Nelson has suffered at times from the ups and downs of its resource-dependent local economy. It became a place that lost its younger folk to bigger cities with more opportunity, Malpass among them.  ""Just like any other ambitious kid, I kind of needed to get out of there to follow my career hopes and aspirations,"" he said.  Malpass went to Simon Fraser University in the Vancouver area, intending to return when he graduated. ""But it became obvious that unless I was going to be a doctor, lawyer or accountant, there wasn't a lot of professional career opportunities for me back there.""   Instead he worked in Toronto for a few years, then Vancouver, where he eventually started a consultancy that has since grown into tech company Traction on Demand. It employs more than 750 people supplying cloud-based applications for use with the popular customer relations platform Salesforce.  But this year, Malpass was able to fulfil his dream of returning to his hometown, establishing a satellite office in Nelson that will eventually be home to 45 employees.  He's one of a growing number of tech founders choosing to locate offices in smaller Canadian towns and cities, addressing the desire of employees to find work in communities they can afford.  Along with the local governments, colleges and universities with whom they partner, these companies are taking steps to spread the wealth, countering what economists say is part of Canada's digital divide — the chasm between those who have access to big-city tech jobs and those who do not.  Making a tech-friendly town  As executive director of Community Futures Central Kootenay, a local non-profit economic development organization, Andrea Wilkey helps nurture Nelson's community of tech and knowledge workers.  Monthly tech meetups bring people together, and free or low-cost courses at the library and community centre ensure kids get a chance to learn to code. Developers who wish to build new housing in the area have to guarantee high speed internet access.    It's all part of ensuring the town isn't too dependent on natural resources, and instead can provide access to jobs in the digital economy — along with a good lifestyle. In addition to Traction, the Kootenays are now home to a number of other tech companies and their satellites, including Retreat Guru, Smrt1 Technologies, Thought Exchange and CoreLogic.  Elsewhere in B.C., tech companies are thriving in places like Kelowna and Vernon in the Okanagan, and in small centres on Vancouver Island, including Qualicum Beach, Courtenay and Duncan.  ""Now's a great time to be growing the tech sector in rural B.C.,"" said Wilkey. ""As the cost of living and housing in major centres becomes increasingly prohibitive, … rural communities have an opportunity to bring new jobs to their region and residents to have a great place to work and live.""    Another upside for Malpass and other tech leaders setting up shop in smaller centres: being able to retain workers who might otherwise be driven away by high housing costs.  As Traction employees entered their 30s and started to think about putting down roots, Malpass said the company started to see ""capable, great employees that have grown up with us start moving.""   Some went to Vancouver Island, others to the B.C. Interior. All told, 15 people left Vancouver in a short time.   Malpass said that got him thinking: ""Why can't we bring great jobs to these great livable communities?""  Traction program architect Emily Beach raised her hand right away when Malpass first started talking about a Nelson office.  ""One of the things I love most in life is being outdoors,"" said Beach. ""I've always looked at people who live in places like Nelson or Pemberton and thought, 'What do you do here? What is allowing you to live in a place like this that you have everything that I want around you — tight-knit community, as well as being in this beautiful environment?'""    Everything started falling into place when Malpass learned that Nelson's local Legion was having a difficult time maintaining its large historic building. He purchased the building, gave the Legion an indefinite lease, and is now renovating the space that will be Traction on Demand's future hometown office.  Beach moved to Nelson in April and is leading a team of seven in a temporary space. Some of the new staffers are locals who previously worked in other tech jobs, and some have no background in technology, including one who worked as a project manager for a paving company.  On the other side of the country, Mike Johnston's company, REDspace, also has its origins in him wanting to return to home turf. Born and raised in Truro, N.S., Johnson studied sciences at Harvard, then worked in tech in the Boston area until the dot-com bubble burst in 2000.  By then, he was married to his high school sweetheart, who'd recently given birth to their first child; the two decided to try their hand at launching a business north of the border.    Things have come along way since Johnston first installed a satellite dish on the roof of their home in Hammonds Plains, on the outskirts of Halifax, in order to get the internet connection he'd need to do some IT consulting from the spare bedroom.  Now headquartered in the Halifax suburb of Bedford, REDspace employs about 200 people who build streaming video technology for television networks.  ""We're finding an increasing interest in people who are looking for a change from the city grind. They're interested in being able to afford a house or have a kayak and go hiking.""  Importing young people  Once known for exporting its young people to other parts of Canada, he said the region is doing a much better job of giving locals and students from the area's colleges and universities a reason to stay after graduation.   ""We're actually hanging onto people and bringing young people to the region, partly because the companies here are doing interesting things.""   REDspace has added more than 50 staff so far this calendar year ""and probably three-quarters of those are from away,"" said Johnston.      Everybody thought we were crazy for leaving the tech ecosystem of the world.  - Jordan Boesch, CEO at 7shifts     Saskatoon is also home to a burgeoning new tech scene — and Jordan Boesch's company 7shifts is a part of that.  He got the idea to build a scheduling platform for the restaurant industry because his dad struggled with co-ordinating staff at the Quiznos locations he ran in Regina.  ""I taught myself to code and built something rudimentary to get the job done,"" he said.  Boesch, his wife and co-founder moved to San Francisco after their idea was accepted into a tech accelerator there. But when they secured some venture capital, they decided to take it back to Canada to make it go further.  ""Everybody thought we were crazy for leaving the tech ecosystem of the world,"" he said.    But being in Saskatoon has allowed them to recruit staff who are among the University of Saskatchewan's computer science graduates. The company now employs 140 people.  Boesch said he feels good about being part of spreading the wealth of tech jobs to places outside of Canada's biggest cities.  ""I don't know if it's just because of the farm background we have here in Saskatchewan, but we have a lot of hard-working people. Being able to take that hard-working grittiness and channel it into growing a tech company is really exciting.""",technology
203,Triumph of engineering: Halifax man switching classic car to electric power,"A research engineer at Dalhousie University is in the process of retrofitting his classic car to be powered by electricity.  Nathaniel Pearre brought his 1971 Triumph Spitfire to the Halifax Waterfront on Saturday for the Electric Avenue — an event that touts itself as the largest electric vehicle event in Atlantic Canada.  ""Having a little electric convertible is something that's a little bit rare on the market and having something that has the vintage style is a nice touch,"" Pearre said.  Pearre is with the Renewable Energy Storage Laboratory at Dalhousie, a group he described as ""enthusiasts of all things electric, including renewable energy and energy storage and electric drive.""  Getting started  He found the convertible in New Brunswick on Kijiji about a year ago. He said it was a good candidate for an electric conversion because ""it had a pretty solid frame and body, but a lousy drive train.""  During the winter, Pearre said he slowly removed all the greasy bits and over the summer he hired an undergrad, Mitch Gregory, to work on the vehicle to develop necessary enclosures and to do a lot of the fabrication work.  ""We were in the Dalhousie heavy prototype lab, so we could really make some progress over the summer and get it to the state that it was in at the show, but we had to get out of the lab by the time the students came back for fall semester,"" he said.  Almost ready to drive  The convertible isn't ready to drive — but it's close. ""There's a lot of fiddly work,"" Pearre said.  ""In an ideal world, it might be two more weeks of work but it's gone from being a full-time project of an energetic undergrad to a weekend and evenings project, so timelines tend to drag,"" he said.  ""But we hope to make it driveable, if not get it on the road by the end of the year, and then over a long cold winter try to refine suspension and make it more roadworthy.""  He said retrofitting a classic car to be electric is not the most sensible or the most economical route, but he said it's a great route for anyone wanting a hobby and a passion and a fun vehicle for Sunday driving.  ""The motivation for building this car was not to save the world, the motivation for building this car was to have fun,"" he said.  MORE TOP STORIES",technology
37,No laughing matter: Critics and audiences debate whether Joker and Jojo Rabbit go too far,"UPDATE: Jojo Rabbit won TIFF's top prize, the People's Choice Award, on Sunday afternoon.    As the city burns, a clown puts his fingers in his bloody mouth and pulls his cheeks into a leering red grin. His crowd of followers bellows in approval.  During the Second World War, a young boy learning to be a good Nazi charges into the forest, with Adolf Hitler skipping merrily at his side.   Those are two distinctive images from two movies dividing audiences at the Toronto International Film Festival.   You could say TIFF has been a festival of extremes. This is where the race to the Oscars begins, and at this point, it could be Mister Rogers and the Joker in a dead heat.  A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood features Tom Hanks as Fred Rogers, the convivial children's television host. The role fits Hanks as snugly as Rogers's sweater. Hanks nails Rogers's singsong voice as well as the intense interest he showed in everyone he met.     But while A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is a feel-good tearjerker, Joker is quite the opposite — a grimy descent that serves as the origin story for one of the most iconic DC Comics characters.  There have been many Jokers, but with Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, the man who becomes the murderous clown, we see the person under the face paint, his bitterness building into a brutal crescendo of violence.   While many of the cast on the red carpet for A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood said they felt the world could use more Mister Rogers right now, Joker is just as much a reflection of our time — albeit, a cracked and twisted view some critics have called irresponsible.  Writing in Time magazine, Stephanie Zacharek described Joker as a prime example of the ""emptiness of our culture"" and called Arthur the ""patron saint of incels.""    While Hollywood Reporter awards columnist Scott Feinberg considers Phoenix an Oscar contender, he warned the film could incite ""real-world problems.""    In the Globe and Mail, Sarah Hagi said Phoenix's Joker represents an ideology, ""becoming more vigilante than villain.""  Speaking to CBC News at the TIFF premiere of the film, Joker director Todd Phillips defended his work.    ""I think a lot of the criticism comes from people who haven't seen the movie yet. We've only showed the movie in Venice and nobody there had that reaction ... I would say, see the movie and judge for yourself.""  Last weekend, the competition jury in Venice awarded Joker the festival's highest honour, the Golden Lion, the first time the prize has gone to a film inspired by a comic book.   Psychos, drivers and clowns  There's nothing novel about a film that explores the minds of deeply disturbed characters.  Think of American Psycho, or Taxi Driver, or A Clockwork Orange — there have always been films that attempt to take us inside the headspace of disturbed individuals.  As Patrick Bateman, Christian Bale exemplified the shallow single-mindedness of the 1980s in American Psycho.  As Travis Bickle, Robert De Niro embodied a desperate sense of loneliness in Taxi Driver.     For his role in Joker, Phoenix dropped more than 50 pounds, transforming into a sinewy scarecrow, topped with a smiling face, absent any joy.   Like many of the films at TIFF such as The Laundromat, Hustlers and Parasite, the backdrop of the Joker is a place of economic disparity. This Gotham is plagued by garbage strikes and super rats. Thugs roam the streets while Thomas Wayne promises to save the upper crust from the chaos. Almost by accident, the Joker becomes a symbol to the angry masses who want to pull Gotham's gleaming towers down.   With the dingy colour scheme and sickly lighting, director Todd Phillips pays homage to, or perhaps outright borrows from, Taxi Driver. But whereas Travis Bickle articulated his own warped view of the world, Arthur Fleck could be seen as a product of his environment.     Arthur is like a weed growing in an abandoned garden. He's the result of a life of neglect, abuse and mental illness. Someone who is ignored and mocked. It's only when Arthur guns down a trio of rich business bros who are bullying him that the citizens of Gotham finally take notice.  For director Phillips, there is a sense of inevitability to the character.  ""Our vision was a guy who ultimately has to become the Joker, so there's gonna be a little bit of anger and rebellion in him.""  Judging Jojo Rabbit's satirical take on Nazi Germany     While the potency of Joker's punchline is no laughing matter, it's the very fact that Jojo Rabbit presents a comedic take on Adolf Hitler that has some critics concerned.   The film, directed by Taika Waititi, follows the life of a young German boy named Jojo during the final days of the Second World War. Jojo dreams of being a good Nazi and is helped by his imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler, played by Waititi.   Waititi plays the dictator in the irreverent style the actoru002Fdirector is known for. The film opens with Hitler acting as Jojo's life coach, teaching him how to do a proper ""Heil Hitler!"" salute and preparing him for his first day of Hitler youth camp.     Waititi first became interested in making the film after his Jewish mother gave him the book Caging Skies, which formed the basis of the screenplay.   Speaking with CBC News at the world premiere in Toronto, he said his original intention was to make a film about intolerance and bigotry. But as hate groups seemed to proliferate and Nazis began to reappear in the news, Jojo's story became even more relevant, he said.     Waititi points to a 2018 poll in the United States that suggested 66 per cent of millennials didn't understand the relevance of Auschwitz.  ""They didn't know what it was, or where it was, or what it meant,"" Waititi said of the Nazi concentration camp where Jews were murdered en masse during the Second World War. ""So I think more than ever, it's vital that we [remind] people of what happened.""    But some critics have suggested Waititi could have gone much further. Variety critic Owen Gleiberman says Jojo Rabbit is a movie ""that pretends to be audacious when it's actually quite tidy and safe."" Indiewire's Eric Khon writes Waititi's whimsical approach ""makes Life is Beautiful look like Shoah.""    While some critics questioned the wisdom of portraying Hitler as a hipster idiot, Roman Griffin Davis, who played young Jojo, says the film shows the effects of the dictator's reign.   ""He's portrayed as a terrible person, through seeing Germany and these little boys terrified. Yeah, it might seem a bit odd, but he's still portrayed as an evil man.""  What some of the initial reactions to the trailer missed is the heart of the film, which focuses on Elsa, the young Jewish woman whom Jojo's mother is hiding from the authorities.      Sweetness and shock  From the film Boy to Hunt for the Wilderpeople to even Thor: Ragnarok, Waititi excels at stories with hidden centres of sweetness. For all their posturing, his heroes are often quite innocent, as is the case with Jojo, a boy who is desperate to join the cause, until he meets a real Jew.   As Elsa says to him at one point, ""You're not a Nazi, Jojo. You're a 10-year-old kid who likes dressing up in a funny uniform and wants to be part of a club.""  True, Jojo Rabbit doesn't peer into the heart of darkness of the Third Reich, and many of the more monstrous crimes of the Nazi regime happen off camera.  But as Waititi brings us into Jojo's world, there is a moment where the inhumanity and indifference of the Nazi regime hits home. A moment that left audiences in Toronto gasping.    Speaking to CBC News, Waititi underlined the importance of finding new ways to explore intolerance.  ""If that involves having to bring in fantasy characters and using magic realism and using different techniques and sometimes comedy, so be it. We have to keep telling these stories.""",entertainment
88,Hospital network sets aside $10M parcel of land for affordable housing,"The University Health Network (UHN) has aside a $10-million parcel of land in Parkdale for an affordable housing project, which it says is a direct response to the needs of its low-income patients.  The UHN's executive director of health and social policy, Dr. Andrew Boozary, said the network is partnering with the City of Toronto and United Way on the Social Medicine Initiative.  The aim is to ease homelessness and improve the health of people living in communities served by Toronto Western and Toronto General hospitals.  ""One of the neighbourhoods is Parkdale, where we see a lot of homeless patients or precariously-housed patients with a lot of both medical and social needs that have been coming into our Toronto Western Hospital,"" Boozary told CBC Toronto.  ""And one of the things that we realized, again from our data and from working with our partners, is that we actually have the highest rate of homeless patients coming into our emergency department at the Toronto Western.""  More than 20 repeat visits in a year  The UHN is a healthcare and medical research organization affiliated with the University of Toronto's faculty of medicine. In addition to Toronto Western and Toronto General, it includes the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto Rehab and the Michener Institute.  UHN data for the period April 2018 to March 2019 shows 61 patients each made more than 20 visits to Toronto General and Toronto Western hospitals. That's a total of 2,096 visits for each of those patients, out of a total of 48,182 visits to UHN emergency departments.  ""We realized that to better serve these patients, to better provide care, we have to be thinking about where they're being discharged home to,"" Boozary said.    ""For many of them, if they do not have adequate or stable housing, that is a major predicament for any health improvement.""  UHN said this is the first time ever in Canada that a health network is building housing to directly answer the needs of its low-income patients.  The network said sick people can't get better if they don't have secure access to food, are vulnerably housed and without ongoing social supports.  ""The reality is, the social safety net in many ways is being torn apart. Those patients fall on us at the hospital and we have to recognize that we have to not only think differently but behave differently in the social crisis that we're facing,"" Boozary told CBC news.",health
204,'More than we expected': Ocearch spots 5 great white sharks off Cape Breton,"Five great white sharks have been spotted and three of them have been tagged in Ocearch's latest expedition off the coast of Cape Breton.  ""I think that is more than we expected, especially when we're only about halfway through the trip,"" Chris Fischer, the founder and expedition leader of Ocearch, said in a phone interview on Sunday.  The U.S.-based shark research organization is currently off Scatarie Island, near Hay Island.  They started around Sept. 14 and expect to be out until Oct. 4. Then the next stop is West Ironbound Island on Oct. 6.  Two of the tagged sharks are mature males, Murdoch and Sydney, and the other is a mature female named Unama'ki.    Sydney was 3.7 metres long, Murdoch was 3.9 metres long and Unama'ki was 4.7 metres long. In addition to being tagged, each shark received a full health assessment.  ""So, interesting to see that all the sharks we've engaged with out here have all been fully mature animals,"" Fischer said. ""I think that's something significant that was different than what we saw down in Lunenburg last year.""  Off Lunenburg, Fischer said they sampled seven animals — five males, two females — and only three were mature. The others were ""sub-adults.""  'The trip's already made'  Temperatures off Scaterie Island, Fischer said, are ""a little cold"" but that ""doesn't seem to have run off the sharks.""  Prior to making the trip to the island, Fischer said he had no idea what to expect. He said they were hopeful because Hilton, a celebrity great white shark with more than 51,000 followers on Twitter, was traced in those waters last year.  ""Having three sharks already tagged, for me, the trip's already made,"" Fischer said. ""When you're coming to a place no one has ever been before and you don't know what's going to happen, that's a pleasant surprise.""      The goal of the shark research is to find out as much as possible about the Canadian great white shark — where it  forages, mates, gives birth, migrates and where females gestate.  ""And that's so you can keep the recovery going because as the white shark goes, the whole system goes,"" he said. ""If the white sharks are thriving up here, there's going to be more fish for your commercial and recreational fisheries.""  Fischer says there are ""hundreds and hundreds of seals"" around Scaterie Island.    He said past research has indicated that when there are great white sharks around, seals feed one-fourth as much each day as they do when white sharks aren't there.  ""So as the white shark population recovers, it will keep those seals pinned up on the beach,"" he said. ""They stay there until they're almost starving and then they go out and get a little food and then they get back out because they might get eaten.""  Details on shark tracking are on Ocearch's website.    MORE TOP STORIES",technology
111,From oil to beer: How pipeline technology could change the food industry,"The Inventions of Oil is a CBC Edmonton series about oil and gas innovations hidden in our everyday lives    The story of a pipeline project that took years to get from drawing board to shovels in the ground might sound routine to Albertans in the thick of oil pipeline politics.  But what if it was a pipeline that transported beer?   It turns out the same technology that moves as much as 3.9 million barrels of oil from Western Canada every day is at the heart of an emerging effort around the globe to rethink how food, drinks and other products are shipped.     Refining the Hula Hoop: how the oil industry sparked a global plastics boom    In Bruges, Belgium, for example, as much as 6,000 litres of beer per hour is pumped through a 3.2-kilometre underground pipeline that stretches from the centuries-old De Halve Maan brewery and restaurant to its new bottling plant outside of town.  The pipeline was first proposed in 2010 as an alternative to transporting beer by truck through the city's bumpy, congested streets, said Xavier Vanneste, the company's CEO and a sixth-generation brewer.  ""In the beginning, people thought it was a joke,"" Vanneste said.   ""Some people said the real estate value alongside the track would grow. Some people were making jokes about making tapping points and leaks, but then as soon as the project continued, and as soon as we advanced, you saw that people were really very enthusiastic about the idea.""  The $5.6 million Cdn project took five years to acquire permits and financing, then another five months to build. By 2016, it was up and running.     With fewer trucks on the road, the brewery's carbon footprint is reduced. As well, the pipeline does a better job of keeping the beer carbonated and, without the need to connect and reconnect tanks, there's less oxidation along the way.   That, said Vanneste, has had a very important impact: better-tasting beer.  The evolution of pipelines  While pipeline systems for water date back to ancient civilizations, most modern technology has been driven by the oil industry, said Mahdi Vaezi, an assistant professor of engineering at Northern Illinois University. He researched alternative uses for pipelines while at the University of Alberta from 2009 through 2014.   ""Any other application of pipelines, it's fair to say it's been developed based on oil pipelines,"" Vaezi said.   Over the last century, the oil and gas industries have led to advancements in pipeline materials, pump technology and leak prevention, he said.     How the country's new pipeline dispute could shake up oil business   Pipeline rupture sends 40,000 litres of oil into Alberta creek    There are 433,000 kilometres of oil and gas pipelines under the jurisdiction of the Alberta Energy Regulator. They would stretch well past the moon if placed end-to-end.   Alberta's pipelines predominantly are used for moving oil and gas products — natural gas, oil well effluent, fuel gas, sour natural gas and more — but pipelines can be used to move almost anything.       Oilpatch pushes for construction to start immediately on green-lit Trans Mountain pipeline     ""Pretty much whatever you can think of has been transported through a pipeline,"" Vaezi said. His research found examples of pipelines moving coal, gold slime, limestone, iron ore and even wood chips.   The Belgian brewery may be the first to build an underground pipeline for beer but it's not the first food business to adopt the technology.   Other food producers are using it but on a much smaller scale, said Sylvain Charlebois, a Dalhousie University professor in Halifax who researches food transportation.       Pretty much whatever you can think of has been transported through a pipeline.  - Mahdi Vaezi, engineering professor Northern Illinois University     The maple syrup industry uses what is essentially a mini-pipeline to connect the sap and water from thousands of trees, he said.   ""On a maple syrup farm, those pipelines could extend well over 10 to 20 kilometres,"" he said.   Commercial dairy farmers adopted the technology in the mid-20th century, moving cow's milk from udder to tankers via a vacuum network of steel pipelines.     More than half of Canadians may have trouble adopting new food guide, survey suggests    Charlebois said there is the potential for agribusiness to scale-up its use of pipeline technology.   ""Prices of food are going up in the U.S. because they don't have enough drivers. With pipelines you don't need drivers,"" Charlebois said. ""If you do it right you could actually make the country more food-secure.""    Fishing for a new food transportation network  A move from steel pipelines to more durable thermoplastics was first introduced by Middle East oil companies to prevent corrosion.   In turn, the thermoplastics technology was used by Seattle-based Whooshh Innovations to make tube systems that move salmon over dams. A video of the process, showing salmon flying through a tube from one body of water to another, has garnered millions of views on YouTube.    According to Jim Otten, Whooshh's vice-president of engineering, the company first started working with Washington's agriculture department but pivoted when the founder saw live fish being assisted by helicopters during their migration.   Unlike underground pipelines, Whooshh's thermoplastic, above-ground tubes are flexible, allowing them to conform to oddly shaped objects. Companies in Norway use their tubes in fish-processing facilities, moving whole and gutted fish from one plant to another.   ""We can put a salmon in the tube but we also can put an apple in the tube or a watermelon or something that's as weird as chicken or potatoes,"" Otten said.   Beyond a pipe dream  Moving agricultural products through pipelines was also a focus of Vaezi's research while at the U of A. Adapted pipelines could make it 50 per cent cheaper to move agricultural waste like straw and corn stover for use as biofuel, he said.  While Vaezi isn't convinced of the economic value of the large-scale transportation of food products, Vanneste, back in Belgium, is a believer. In fact, other wineries and breweries have been visiting to see if the technology could work for them, he said.     Happy hour not over for Alberta's craft beer boom   Meet Watershed Brewing Co.: Alberta's most real fake brewery    ""Everybody is looking at how they can reduce their carbon footprint and how they can reduce heavy transportation in small city centres,"" he said. ""This is actually a very positive solution to that.""",technology
211,"Sudbury researcher has closer look at makeup of McIntyre Powder, once used in mining","Before each shift between the 1940s and 1970s, underground miners in northern Ontario breathed in a substance they thought was protecting their lungs, but none of them knew what exactly was in McIntyre Powder. Until now.  Many of these mine workers developed respiratory or neurological illnesses, later in life.  It was a connection Laurentian University researcher Andrew Zarnke wanted to pursue.    The occupational health coordinator has recently published a paper on the physical and chemical makeup of McIntyre Powder.  He expected to find aluminum and aluminum hydroxide.  But he also discovered the powder was made up of microscopic, ultra-fine particles, known as nanoparticles.  Previous research has connected nanoparticles — of any substance — to harmful health issues, particularly when they're inhaled. This includes studies on diesel exhaust particulates, which is also a current health concern in mining.  ""With nano-technologies these days, you know it brings McIntyre Powder into the arena with a lot of these more recent studies that are looking at health effects from nano-materials,"" Zarnke said.  'No longer a dirty little secret somewhere'  For the past five years, Janice Martell has been collecting health data from miners across northern Ontario who were exposed to the powder. Her father was forced to inhale the substance and later was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease. She now feel her work to uncover the truth has been validated.  ""It bears witness to what they went through and it also gives us some information to answer the next steps,"" she said.    Martell is especially pleased for what this means for the men who were exposed to the aluminum dust, and their loved ones.  ""Being able to go back to miners, mine workers and their families and say 'Hey this is no longer a dirty little secret somewhere that they were sweeping under the rug,'"" Martell said.  ""And to be able to provide them with some answers as to what their loved one or themselves were exposed to.""  More research needed  Zarnke says the next phase of the research involves biological studies to see how human cells react to McIntyre Powder.  ""Next steps which involve some biological studies looking at possible geno-toxic effects from the combined stressors of McIntyre Powder or nano-materials and radiation.""  ""So we're now using the information from this new publication to generate hypotheses with regards to possible biological mechanisms and health affects,"" he said.  ""Being able to provide something like this [research] and say here's one more piece of the puzzle is validating,"" Martell said.  The research is available online at the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Hygiene. It will be published in the November issue of the journal.  Zarnke and Martell will be in Elliot Lake Sept. 23 to hold a public information session. While in the community they also plan to meet with local physicians to discuss mining exposures and health.",technology
216,Placido Domingo to resume US performances amid misconduct allegations,"When opera superstar Placido Domingo appeared in Europe last month after being accused of sexual harassment by multiple women, his performances were greeted with rapturous ovations.  This week, the spotlight moves to the U.S., where Domingo faces two investigations into his behaviour and is scheduled to help kick off the new season at New York's Metropolitan Opera. Companies in three other American cities have cancelled his performances due to the allegations.  Wednesday's appearance in Macbeth marks the legendary tenor's first performance in the U.S. since the publication of two Associated Press stories in which numerous women said he sexually harassed them or engaged in other inappropriate behaviour, including one soprano who said he grabbed her bare breast under her robe.  Domingo has called the allegations ""in many ways, simply incorrect,"" without providing any specifics.    Domingo is general director of LA Opera, which has engaged outside counsel to conduct its investigation. He also is being investigated by the American Guild of Musical Artists, the union representing many opera employees.  The Met has said it will wait for the results of the LA Opera investigation before deciding on any action against Domingo, who is scheduled to perform at the storied opera house seven times this season.  Emotional, heated meeting at The Met  The Met's general manager, Peter Gelb, held a one-hour meeting with chorus singers and orchestra musicians after a dress rehearsal Saturday to discuss the Mets' position on the allegations.  In characterizing the meeting, Gelb said, ""I said we took the allegations very seriously. For some people, allegations are enough to warrant actions, but the Met as an institution does not believe it can take action until there is corroborated evidence, which has so far not been the case.""  Gelb said he also noted the Met was closely monitoring the two investigations and ""we are prepared to take action when action is merited.""  One musician who attended the meeting and spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation described the session as heated and often emotional.  Some staff members were visibly emotional as they challenged Gelb, the musician said, with at least one telling him, ""This is exactly why women don't come forward."" But one female chorus member spoke up in support of the Met's position, the musician noted.  Several attendees complained the Met was being inconsistent, referring to the 2018 firing of its famed conductor, James Levine, amid accusations that he had sexually abused several men when they were teenagers. The company initially suspended Levine in 2017 after the allegations surfaced and then severed ties with him after conducting its own investigation.  Domingo was not at the staff meeting, but did participate in a previously scheduled sexual harassment seminar last week with fellow cast members, according to a Met staff member with direct knowledge of the meeting, who spoke on condition of anonymity for the same reasons.  Music workers union investigates  The AGMA launched its own investigation after saying it couldn't be certain that opera companies would thoroughly investigate the allegations or make their findings public.  The union's national executive director, Len Egert, told the AP that AGMA hopes its inquiry can be wrapped up ""in a couple of months.""  He said he could not provide details, but indicated the union also is taking on board the wider problem of misconduct across the industry and the fear of retaliation by men in positions of power.    ""In addition to what we have done so far, AGMA will continue to search for and implement methods to change the culture,"" he said.  Domingo is scheduled to appear in three performances of Macbeth, two of them opposite the soprano Anna Netrebko, and then return to the Met for four performances of Madama Butterfly in November.  Outside the Met, Domingo's next scheduled U.S. performance is not until February, with LA Opera, which has not said how long it expects its investigation to last.  Three major American companies — the Philadelphia Orchestra, the San Francisco Opera and Dallas Opera — cancelled upcoming concerts starring Domingo after the AP stories were published.  None of Domingo's upcoming performances in Europe have been cancelled; he has a busy fall lineup of operas and concerts in Switzerland, Russia, Austria, Germany, Spain, Italy and Poland.    The most serious allegation against Domingo comes from soprano Angela Turner Wilson, now a voice teacher in the Dallas area, who said he forcefully grabbed her breast in a makeup room during a run at the Washington Opera in 1999.  The Washington Opera issued statements saying it has ""zero tolerance"" for harassment but did not receive any ""documented complaints"" about Domingo's behaviour during his 15 years as artistic director and general director of the company. It has declined to comment on whether it plans any investigation.  LA Opera inquiry continues  During its inquiry, the LA Opera — which Domingo helped found in the 1980s, and where several accusations of sexual misconduct occurred — has removed Domingo from day-to-day operations as general director, a post he has held since 2003.  The investigation is being led by Debra Wong Yang, a former U.S. attorney and Los Angeles County Superior Court judge, now a partner at the law firm of Gibson Dunn &amp; Crutcher.    In a statement emailed to the AP, a committee of LA Opera board members urged anyone with relevant information to contact Gibson Dunn and provide statements on the record, adding that, if requested, they ""will take reasonable efforts to keep the individual's identity as confidential as possible.""  The committee added that the LA Opera ""strictly prohibits retaliation of any kind against anyone participating in this investigation in good faith.""  The union also has said it will allow participants to remain anonymous if they request it.  Sexual harassment experts say allowing confidential reports is crucial to a thorough investigation because of the fear of retaliation in an insular industry like opera.",entertainment
150,"Nissan paying $15M, Ghosn $1M to settle SEC fraud charges","Nissan has agreed to pay $15 million US and its former chairman Carlos Ghosn is paying $1 million to settle federal regulators' civil fraud charges of hiding from investors more than $140 million in compensation and retirement benefits for Ghosn.  The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the settlement Monday with the Japanese automaker and its former chairman, who also agreed to be barred for 10 years from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  Ghosn is awaiting trial in Japan on financial misconduct allegations.  Ghosn, who led Nissan for two decades, was arrested by Japanese authorities in Tokyo and jailed four times since November. Ghosn has maintained he is innocent. He is currently out on bail but faces restrictions on his activities such as not being allowed to contact his wife, Carole Ghosn. She has appeared before a Japanese judge to answer questions in the case. The first hearing in the trial has been set for April.  Ghosn and Nissan Motor Co. settled the charges without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, but agreed to refrain from future anti-fraud violations of the securities laws.  In addition, a former Nissan director, Greg Kelly, agreed to pay a $100,000 penalty to settle the SEC charges, to be barred for five years from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and to be suspended for five years from practicing as an attorney before the SEC.  In a statement, Ghosn's team of lawyers noted that he will be allowed to contest and deny the allegations in the criminal case in Japan, and they said he ""fully intends to do so.""  ""Mr. Ghosn and his defence team are now able to focus their efforts on continuing to vigorously fight the criminal case in Japan and pursue his claims against Nissan around the world,"" the statement said. ""They remain confident that, if given a fair trial, he will be acquitted of all charges and fully vindicated.""  Attorneys representing Nissan declined to comment on the SEC settlement. An attorney for Kelly wasn't immediately available for comment.  Alleged undisclosed compensation  Starting in 2009, Ghosn — with the help of Kelly and subordinates at Nissan — conducted a scheme to conceal more than $90 million of his compensation from investors and public disclosure, while also acting to increase his retirement benefits by over $50 million, the SEC alleged. Each year, Ghosn fixed a total amount of compensation for himself, with a certain amount paid and disclosed, and an additional amount unpaid and undisclosed, according to the agency.  The regulators said that Ghosn and his subordinates concocted various ways of structuring payment of the undisclosed compensation after his retirement, including entering into secret contracts, backdating letters to grant him interests in Nissan's long-term incentive plan, and changing the way his pension was calculated to generate over $50 million in additional benefits.  ""Simply put, Nissan's disclosures about Ghosn's compensation were false,"" Steven Peikin, co-director of the SEC's enforcement division, said in a statement. ""Through these disclosures, Nissan advanced Ghosn and Kelly's deceptions and misled investors, including U.S. investors.""",business
227,Downton Abbey returns to offer comfort in today's 'whirlpool' of turmoil,"Lady Edith is cheerful and contented — and that's saying something, given how life has given the middle Crawley sister on Downton Abbey a considerable dose of heartbreak.  So is Daisy, the under cook, who tells her sympathetic kitchen boss Mrs. Patmore: ""I'm happy. I don't often say it, but I am.""  Lady Edith and Daisy end up revelling in their fortunate emotional state as the British TV period melodrama that brought them into living rooms around the world makes its much-anticipated return as a feature film, opening in North American theatres today.  And in that, the movie goes some distance toward a goal its creators had of offering moviegoers some emotional succor against the backdrop of a planet in turmoil.  ""In a world that is lacking in certainty, I hope that, for the price of a cinema ticket, viewers will get two hours of comfort and reassurance in return,"" creator Julian Fellowes told Harper's Bazaar. ""A bit of a rest from the whirlpool.""   That goal wasn't lost on the actors who reunited for the big screen.    ""There's so much uncertainty … and this is like an antidote to all the horrors that [are] going on,"" Phyllis Logan, who plays housekeeper Elsie Hughes, said this week as she stopped off in Toronto to promote the film.  Lesley Nicol, who plays Mrs. Patmore, also sees the film offering audiences more than escapism.  ""It does celebrate things that people do value, like being decent with each other and ... being loyal to people and all those traits,"" Nicol said during the media stop at Spadina Museum.  ""At heart, [these values are] very important and it feels in this world at the moment that some of the people in charge are not giving that any thought at all, and I think it reassures people.""  Maybe we're more aware  Not that these times are necessarily more stressful than previous eras, but perhaps people are more aware of the turmoil in the world, when the next bad headline is right there waiting on the screen of your phone.  ""I don't know if it's so much the geopolitical world as it is the way modern media presents it to people,"" said Michael Kennedy, a Downton fan and film and television director who also teaches directing at Sheridan College in Oakville, Ont.  ""I think you'd be hard-pressed to say today films serve as comfort more than in the past, but I think audiences seek it and need it more because they're more aware of the anxiety and dangers that are out there in the world.""    In the world of Downton Abbey, however, there isn't a lot of anxiety or danger. The aristocratic Crawley family lives upstairs in the elegantly appointed big house (Highclere Castle in real life), with their loyal staff below stairs. Lives and loves unfold with a fair degree of melodrama.  In one of the TV show's soapier moments, Lady Mary had to sort out how to deal with the dead body of a handsome Turkish diplomat who succumbed to a heart attack while in bed with her, a story Fellowes has said is based on a real incident.  In the case of the film, the central tenet is how a visit by King George V and Queen Mary to Downton Abbey in 1927 will affect everyone — upstairs and down.  ""In today's time, that's a fairly minor issue considering the slate of things that most people see in the news ... and have to deal with every day, so I believe, yes [Downton Abbey] is providing a comfort and an escape,"" said Kennedy, much like other popular films this year such as The Lion King or How to Train Your Dragon.  That's not to say Downton Abbey doesn't give a nod to issues of its day that are more fraught — a police raid on an illegal nightclub where gay men gather offers the audience some moments of sober second thought.    Downton Abbey's return comes more than three years after the series left TV with a boatload of awards and much praise for its high production values, but no promise of a return.  Still, fans always hoped the aristocratic Crawleys and their downstairs staff would be back. When advance tickets went on sale last month, the movie had more sales than any other drama so far this year.     Are you ready to return to Downton Abbey? This superfan is    And when those moviegoers settle into their seats, they'll be transported back to the familiar opening scenes and sounds of the clacking of a train down a track and the dinging of a service bell.  Even in that familiarity, there can be some solace for the audience.  ""I think people become attached to these details and then are psychologically prepared to relax for an hour or two and be entertained and comforted by some of their favourite characters,"" said Kennedy.  Back in fine form  Those favourites are all back in fine form in the movie, from Maggie Smith's Dowager Countess of Grantham (and her zingers) to Mrs. Hughes and her now-husband, Carson, the retired butler who returns to give his downstairs guidance as the house prepares for the royal visit.    ""As a fan of the show, you're rooting for the happiness of characters … from different backgrounds and different ages and different walks of life,"" said Michael Rubinoff, co-producer of the theatrical juggernaut Come from Away.  ""And I think we like seeing that mirror reflected. We may not be an earl or a count or a member of the Royal Family, but perhaps we see ourselves in some of the other characters or in the working-class characters, regardless of class.""  Logan said the cast has a character everybody can relate to, whether it's Barrow, now the butler, or Lady Mary.  ""They were all developed over the years,"" said Nicol. ""We were on a journey, but the audience were on it with us for sure. [Fellowes] developed everybody's story because he's such a good writer and I think that's what happened. People got hooked into what's going to happen to them next.""     Downton Abbey returns: The enduring charm of lavish living    As much as Downton Abbey was praised for its writing, storytelling, lush costumes and scenes, it also faced its share of criticism during its TV run, from quibbles over historical accuracy to debate over its portrayal of class.  Still, suggests Rubinoff, such criticism doesn't diminish the entertainment value and any emotional response a show such as Downton can provide or provoke, even for a little while.  ""Whether you have questions about things that are factual — whether you say, oh it's just entertainment and everything's going on around it, you cannot deny an emotional response to … something that's in the arts-related or entertainment mediums,"" said Rubinoff.  ""Those feelings are real.""    Of course, any happiness audience members might feel after seeing something like Downton Abbey may not last that long after they leave the theatre.  ""But it does allow you to engage with others in a certain way that might be more positive than if you hadn't watched that … coming into your workplace and having a discussion about how much you enjoyed something,"" said Rubinoff, who is also creative producing director of the Canadian Music Theatre Project at Sheridan.  ""That might just set a positive tone to the day or strengthen a relationship between colleagues or people. I think that's a good thing.""  Obviously, Rubinoff said, the Downton creators weren't setting out to do a documentary. It's a drama, more in that realm of soap opera.  ""But if you find something joyous, I think that emotional response should be embraced, and that's good entertainment.""",entertainment
189,Alberta parents David and Collet Stephan found not guilty in their toddler's death after retrial,"An Alberta couple who treated their son's illness with natural remedies rather than take him to a doctor have been found not guilty in the toddler's death after a retrial.  David and Collet Stephan were tried on charges of failing to provide the necessaries of life to 19-month-old Ezekiel, who died in 2012.   Supporters in the courtroom cheered and Collet Stephan cried as she hugged her husband.  Court of Queen's Bench Justice Terry Clackson spoke to the court in Lethbridge, Alta., for only four minutes on Thursday before releasing his written decision in the judge-alone trial.   The judge ultimately sided with the defence's medical experts in finding the boy had viral not bacterial meningitis and ultimately died of a lack of oxygen.   Speaking with the media after the decision was handed down, David Stephan called the last seven years an ""emotional roller-coaster.""    ""We didn't know what to expect coming into today, and it's the right decision, and it's shocking because it's been seven years of our life fighting this so it's become part of our identity,"" he said.  ""It's a beautiful thought that we can move on with our lives.""  Stephan said his case ""helps protect parental rights"" so that parents won't be held criminally liable if they choose alternative treatments for their sick children.  He also says the fight isn't over between his family and the Alberta government — he still wants to recoup the $1.2 million he says his family has spent in legal fees.   This was the second trial for the Stephans, who were found guilty by a Lethbridge jury in 2016. While the Alberta Court of Appeal upheld the conviction, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled the original trial judge erred in his instructions to the jury.    Appeal not ruled out  Back then, the official cause of death was bacterial meningitis.  However, in his written decision, Clackson wrote that he accepted the opinion of Alberta's former chief medical officer, Dr. Anny Sauvageau, who told court she does not believe Ezekiel actually died from bacterial meningitis.   ""In this case, we know there is no specific treatment that is effective for viral meningitis,"" Clackson wrote.  ""It follows that the Crown did not prove medical attention would have saved [Ezekiel's] life or that if he had viral meningitis and it was life-threatening [which is not established in the evidence], medical attention even could have saved his life.""  In a written statement, the Alberta Crown Prosecution Service said it has not yet decided whether to appeal Clackson's decision.  ""We respect the decision of the Court,"" reads the statement. ""This has been a challenging case for everyone involved. The Alberta Crown Prosecution Service will review the decision to determine next steps.""  Treated with natural remedies  Over the course of the trial, the Stephans testified that they initially thought Ezekiel had croup, an upper airway infection, and they treated him with natural remedies including a smoothie with garlic, onion and horseradish.  They said he appeared to be recovering at times, and they saw no reason to take him to hospital, despite his having a fever and lacking energy.  They called an ambulance when the boy stopped breathing.  David Stephan, who was representing himself, said in his final arguments that it was paramedics who caused Ezekiel's death by improperly intubating the boy.      'Bad things happen to good parents,' defence argues at trial of Alberta couple in son's meningitis death     Sauvageau also suggested Ezekiel might have lived had the first ambulance to Cardston, Alta., been better equipped to treat a child his age with breathing difficulties.   Clackson also heard evidence the parents suspected the boy had meningitis and were told days before he stopped breathing to take Ezekiel to a hospital or doctor.  ""It's the Stephans' failure to respond to … increasingly alarming information or feedback from their child during that period of time,"" Crown prosecutor Britta Kristensen said in her closing argument.  ""Both parents knew the child had meningitis.""",health
236,New esports network VENN aims to bring 'gaming as a lens into pop culture',"A new, 24u002F7 esports gaming network called VENN that aims to blend pop culture and gaming was announced on Tuesday, after generating $17 million (all funds US) in seed round funding.  Co-founders Ariel Horn and Ben Kusin told Reuters that the venture will launch sometime in mid 2020 and is angling to be a ""universal network"" with programs like first-run esports events, reality shows, documentaries and game shows.  ""You have this $150 billion-a-year industry that has no TV network,"" said Kusin, former global director of new media at Vivendi Games. ""We are a universal network —that means we will be distributed and consumed anywhere our audience is consuming gaming content.""  Popular esports streaming services like Twitch, which is owned by Amazon, and Mixer, which is owned by Microsoft, are among the platforms VENN is aiming to be distributed on, according to Horn, along with YouTube, Roku, Hulu and Apple TV.  A representative for the company said it is not announcing any streaming agreements yet.  Investors include Kevin Lin, the co-founder of Twitch, and Mike Morhaime and Marc Merrill, the co-founders of Blizzard Entertainment and Riot Games, respectively, among others in the gaming, sports and business industries.    Esports has gained rapid popularity worldwide, drawing top-dollar investments, with global revenue from professional video-game competitions expected to hit $1.1 billion in 2019.  ""We can see that gaming is having a moment,"" said Horn, ""We can tell there's this incredible groundswell around gaming and awareness is at an all-time high.""",entertainment
193,"'How dare you': At UN climate summit, Greta Thunberg slams world leaders in emotional address","Teenage climate change activist Greta Thunberg on Monday opened the United Nations Climate Action Summit with an angry condemnation of world leaders for failing to take strong measures to combat climate change. ""How dare you?"" she said.  Days after millions of young people took to the streets worldwide to demand emergency action on climate change, world leaders gathered at the United Nations in New York City on Monday to try to inject fresh momentum into stalling efforts to curb carbon emissions.  Thunberg, visibly emotional, said in shaky but stern remarks at the opening of the summit that the generations that have polluted the most have burdened her and her generation with the extreme impacts of climate change.  ""This is all wrong. I shouldn't be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you,"" she said.  ""You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words,"" Thunberg said.  Advising world leaders that they'd be watched closely, she added: ""You are failing us, but young people are starting to understand your betrayal.""    UN Secretary General António Guterres has warned governments that they would have to offer action plans to qualify to speak at the summit, which is aimed at boosting the 2015 Paris Agreement to combat global warming.  Leaders including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the one-day gathering, alongside companies working to promote renewable energy.  Merkel said Germany would double its spending to fight climate change to €4 billion ($5.8 billion  Cdn), while Modi pledged to reduce his country's commitment to renewable energy, as well as spending the equivalent of $50 billion Cdn through 2025 to shore up water conservation efforts.  U.S. President Donald Trump, a climate change denier who has undone every major U.S. regulation aimed at fighting climate change, made a brief appearance in the audience of the summit along with Vice-President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Trump listened to the remarks by Modi and Merkel, and then departed.  Former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, detailing his organization's to promote clean energy projects around the globe with willing countries, thanked Trump for showing up and threw a jab the president's way, drawing some laughs.  ""Hopefully our discussions here today will be useful for you when you formulate climate policy,"" said Bloomberg.  Watch: Montreal mayor Plante on how cities can fight climate change    Among the day's other initial announcements was one from the Marshall Islands, whose president, Hilda Heine, said she would seek parliamentary approval to declare a climate crisis on the low-lying atoll, which is already grappling with sea level rise.  Heine said her country and New Zealand, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and others that form the High Ambition bloc at UN climate negotiations will commit to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.  With climate impacts such as extreme weather, thawing permafrost and sea-level rise unfolding much faster than expected, scientists say the urgency of the crisis has intensified since the Paris accord was agreed.    As well, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) unveiled plans to plant urban forests over an area four times the size of Hong Kong, seeking to make Africa and Asia's rapidly growing cities greener.  The initial plan is to support 90 cities in 30 countries in Africa and Asia to create green areas, said FAO director-general Qu Dongyu in a statement. More specific details are expected to be released later in the week.  If managed well, urban forests could reduce air temperatures and cut the cost of air conditioning, the FAO said.   The Paris agreement will enter a crucial implemenation phase next year after another round of negotiations in Chile in December. Pledges made under the agreement are nowhere near enough to avert catastrophic warming, scientists say, and last year carbon emissions hit a record high.  While some countries have made progress, some of the biggest emitting ones remain far behind, even as wildfires, heat waves and record temperatures have provided glimpses of the devastation that could lie in store in a warmer world.  Phase out fossil fuel support, Guterres urges  In a measure of the gap between government action and the ever-louder alarms sounded by climate scientists, the United Nations Development Program said 14 nations representing a quarter of global emissions have signalled that they do not intend to revise current climate plans by 2020.  Over the past year, Guterres has called for no new coal plants to be built after 2020, urged a phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies and asked countries to map out how to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.  ""Is it common sense to give trillions in hard-earned taxpayers' money to the fossil fuel industry to boost hurricanes, spread tropical diseases, and heighten conflict?"" said Guterres in his speech. ""Is it common sense to build ever more coal plants that are choking our future?""  A group of 13 major oil companies charted out a plan on Monday to promote investments in carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS).    Oil chiefs grappling with growing demand for action to fight climate change have looked to invest in carbon-capture and sequestration techniques that some executives, including Occidental Petroleum Corp CEO Vicki Hollub, said could make drilling carbon neutral.  With fossil fuel development growing worldwide, the oil and gas industry faces growing criticism from activists concerned about accelerating climate impacts from melting ice caps to sea-level rise and extreme weather.  The group, formed in 2014 and known as the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI), said it aims to double the amount of carbon dioxide stored globally by 2030. The group is also taking steps to reduce methane emissions.  The companies, which include Exxon Mobil Corp, Chevron Corp and BP PLC, account for 32 per cent of global oil and gas production. They have agreed to co-operate to accelerate reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.  Separately, almost 90 big companies in sectors from food to cement to telecommunications are pledging to slash greenhouse gas emissions, summit organizers said.  'The house is on fire': Protest in D.C.  Trump, in his first few months in office, signalled his intention to pull the United States out of the 2015 Paris accord and has rolled back Obama-era rules on emission cuts and wants to maximize U.S. energy output.  Activists seeking to pressure U.S. politicians to fight climate change blocked major traffic hubs in Washington, D.C. —  chaining themselves to a sailboat in one location — as they sought to draw attention to the summit.    Police arrived with a power saw to free the protesters chained to the boat, draping them with heavy blankets to protect them from flying sparks, and called a truck to haul the boat away.  About 200 protesters chanted nearby: ""It's dire! It's dire! The house is on fire!""  The protest was backed by about two dozen groups, including the Metro D.C. chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America, Extinction Rebellion D.C. and Black Lives Matter D.C.",technology
80,"Tim Hortons pulls Beyond Meat products from Canadian locations outside B.C., Ontario ","Tim Hortons will no longer offer Beyond Meat products at its eateries outside Ontario and B.C.  ""We are always listening to our guests and testing a wide variety of products across the country,"" Restaurant Brands International (RBI), the parent company of Tim Hortons, wrote in an email to CBC News.  ""Both the Beyond Burger and Beyond Meat breakfast sandwiches were introduced as a limited time offer. We have particularly seen positive reaction to our Beyond Meat offering in Ontario and B.C., especially in breakfast, and are proud to offer both alternatives in those regions.""  RBI said the Beyond Burger —  which the chain added to its menu to much fanfare in July — will still be available for a limited time across the country. The Beyond Meat breakfast sandwiches are available in various regions while supplies last, but after that will continue to be sold only in B.C. and Ontario.  The popularity of plant-based products in general, and Beyond Meat in particular, has soared over the past 18 months or so. Just weeks after it started selling its Beyond Meat burger in July 2018, there were reports A&amp;W completely sold out of the product nationwide.  Not long afterwards, Beyond Meat products started popping up at other quick-serve restaurant chains, including Tim Hortons and Subway, as well as grocery stores.  Plant-based eating trend  But plant-based proteins — or even proteins in general — aren't part of the core business of Tim Hortons, said Sylvain Charlebois, director of the Agri-food Analytics Lab, and professor in food distribution and policy at Dalhousie University in Halifax.   ""Timmies is all about coffee, doughnuts and muffins. They just rode on this Beyond Meat bandwagon, and that's dangerous because they tried to capitalize on a brand and not necessarily a product,"" he said.  ""It's like the pizza at McDonald's. It was a disaster back in the '80s because nobody goes to McDonald's to eat pizza.""  Charlebois said his data shows B.C. has the highest rate of veganism in the country and Ontario has the highest rate of vegetarianism, which may explain the decision to continue offering Beyond Meat breakfast sandwiches in those provinces.    ""I was a bit surprised by Quebec because in Quebec, the Beyond Meat product is selling very well in retail stores, but I guess Quebecers just didn't want to buy it in a restaurant,"" said Charlebois.  He said the decision is a blow for Beyond Meat.  ""Beyond Meat's strategy is all about developing channels to connect with the public. They don't spend a dime on publicity or marketing. Zero. They just capitalize in their relationships with franchises in order to sell their products.  ""It's a bit dangerous to do that because if someone pulls [the product], like a major restaurant chain like Tim Hortons, that's going to send the wrong signal to Canadians or to the public.""    Beyond Meat also faces increased competition from other companies, including Impossible Foods, which has a deal with Burger King to sell its plant-based burgers in the U.S. Like Tim Hortons, Burger King is owned by RBI.  Recently, some health experts have questioned Beyond Meat's claims its burgers are healthier than a traditional beef hamburger.  None of this, however, has greatly affected Beyond Meat's stock, which is up more than 500 per cent since its IPO last May.     Beyond Meat shares soar on first day of trading    Charlebois said that's because plant-based foods continue to show impressive growth.  ""I don't think it's the end of plant-based dieting. I think [Tim Hortons] is just re-evaluating its menu. Bear in mind that since RBI bought Tim Hortons, they've been trying all sorts of different products and they've pulled several products. Beyond Meat is just the latest one.""  For its part, Beyond Meat said its products in Tim Hortons locations in Ontario and B.C. ""have seen particularly positive reception.  ""These menu items were introduced as limited time offerings and may be brought back in the future,"" the company said in a statement.  RBI also confirmed that possibility.  ""We may explore offering the product again in other provinces at a future date based on ongoing guest feedback.""",health
192,"Havana syndrome: Exposure to neurotoxin may have been cause, study suggests","The mysterious ailments experienced by some 40 Canadian and U.S. diplomats and their families while stationed in Cuba may have had nothing to do with sonic ""attacks"" identified in earlier studies.   According to a new Canadian study, obtained exclusively by Radio-Canada's investigative TV program Enquête, the cause could instead be neurotoxic agents used in pesticide fumigation.  A number of Canadians and Americans living in Havana fell victim to an unexplained illness starting in late 2016, complaining of concussion-like symptoms, including headaches, dizziness, nausea and difficulty concentrating. Some described hearing a buzzing or high-pitched sounds before falling sick.  In the wake of the health problems experienced over the past three years, Global Affairs Canada commissioned a clinical study by a team of multidisciplinary researchers in Halifax, affiliated with the Brain Repair Centre, Dalhousie University and the Nova Scotia Health Authority.   ""The working hypothesis actually came only after we had most of the results,"" Dr. Alon Friedman, the study's lead author, said in an interview.     Read the full study report here.    The researchers identified a damaged region of the brain that is responsible for memory, concentration and sleep-and-wake cycle, among other things, and then looked at how this region could come to be injured.  ""There are very specific types of toxins that affect these kinds of nervous systems ... and these are insecticides, pesticides, organophosphates — specific neurotoxins,"" said Friedman. ""So that's why we generated the hypothesis that we then went to test in other ways.""  Twenty-six individuals participated in the study, including a control group of people who never lived in Havana.  The researchers — comprised of 15 principal investigators and their teams — conducted a thorough assessment of the Canadians' symptoms, including blood tests and several brain imaging tests.    ""[The results] all support the diagnosis of acquired brain injury in the Canadian diplomats and their families posted in Cuba,"" the study report says.  The scientists were also able to test several of the subjects before and after they returned from Cuba, Friedman noted, and the team saw changes in the brain ""that are definitely due to that time when they were in Havana.""  High dose vs. low dose  The report also examines different scenarios of neurotoxic attacks that occurred in history, including the Tokyo subway sarin gas attack in 1995 and the death of the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Kuala Lumpur in 2017.    It concludes that these cases were the result of high-dose exposures, which is not consistent with what happened in Havana.    The symptoms experienced by the diplomats and their families, rather, are consistent with low-dose exposure, leading researchers to examine the effects of cholinesterase (ChE) blockers in commercial products.  ChE is one of the key enzymes required for the proper functioning of the nervous system. Certain classes of pesticides work by inhibiting ChE.   Cuba, like other tropical countries, regularly sprays pesticides to kill insects that carry infectious diseases.    The researchers found that since 2016, Cuba launched an aggressive campaign against mosquitoes to stop the spread of the Zika virus.  The embassies actively sprayed in offices, as well as inside and outside diplomatic residences — sometimes five times more frequently than usual. Many times, spraying operations were carried out every two weeks, according to embassy records.    Toxicological analysis of the Canadian victims confirmed the presence of pyrethroid and organophosphate — two compounds found in fumigation products.  There was also a correlation between the individuals most affected by the symptoms and the number of fumigations that were performed at their residence.  'Sonic weapons' or mass hysteria?  Since these mysterious Havana symptoms became public in the summer of 2017, the main hypothesis about the source of the attacks has been some kind of unknown weapon using sonic or microwave technology.   With many victims reporting disturbing or even violent noises and pressure in their heads during the onset of symptoms, the idea of an ""acoustic weapon"" seemed plausible.  Another suggested reason for the symptoms — proposed and defended by several scientists — was mass hysteria.    The symptoms experienced by the victims — headaches, hearing loss, cognitive problems, loss of balance, etc. — are frequently found in the general population, these scientists argued, and can be attributed to many causes. They further argued that these symptoms may have pre-existed in the victims, becoming heightened in individuals worried about their safety in Cuba.  While a psychological component cannot be completely ruled out, according to the results of the Dalhousie study, it seems to have played a secondary role.    Cindy Calkin, a psychiatrist and member of the multidisciplinary research team, said she categorically rejects the idea of mass hysteria.  ""I have interviewed all but one or two of [the victims] and I haven't found any evidence of psychiatric disorder. This is a very strong group, very resilient and there is no evidence of mass hysteria,"" she said. ""Part of the diagnostic of mass hysteria is that there is no underlying other medical cause that can be found. And we [found] underlying medical evidence.""  For Friedman, the most important outcome of the study is that the team raised a health issue that likely affects a broader population — beyond the diplomats and their families.   ""We [will] continue the research in other ways to try to confirm which of the toxins is more toxic, at what levels — many things are not known yet,"" he said. ""It's just the beginning of a research, but it's what we're working on now.""    The researchers are now looking to collaborate with Cuban officials to determine whether any Cubans suffered similar brain injuries, as their study only focused on Canadian individuals.   In an email to CBCu002FRadio-Canada, spokesperson John Babcock said that Global Affairs Canada hasn't definitively determined a cause to the mysterious ailments at this point.   ""While we are exploring all avenues, including the research at Dalhousie, no definitive cause of the health incidents has been identified to date,"" he said.

46,"Trudeau has reckoned with the past before, but now it is his own history he must address","Justin Trudeau has embraced the idea that the government of Canada should acknowledge and apologize for its wrongs.  As prime minister, he has officially dealt with some of the most shameful moments in the nation's collective past: the turning away of the Komagata Maru in 1914, the treatment of children in residential schools in Newfoundland and Labrador, the federal government's discrimination against LGBT Canadians, the hanging of six Tsilhqot'in chiefs in 1864, the refusal to accept the the asylum requests of more than 900 German Jews in 1939, the mistreatment of Inuit with tuberculosis several decades ago and the conviction of Chief Poundmaker for treason in 1885.  In the fall of 2017, after Trudeau used a speech to the United Nations General Assembly to confront Canada's painful history of mistreating Indigenous people, the Conservative party asked its supporters in a fundraising email whether they were ""tired of people apologizing for our country's rich history.""  But for all that — for all the wrongdoing and pain Trudeau has addressed — it is something else entirely when the wrongs you are accounting for are your own.  That is immeasurably more difficult.  Trudeau's initial apology on Wednesday night was not enough and not only because another image emerged on Thursday morning. And what he said with his second appearance before the cameras surely won't be the end of this.   But on Thursday — standing on the grass of a city square in downtown Winnipeg, surrounded by a crowd of curious onlookers — he went further, wrestling with himself and trying to account for the inexcusable.    'It was blackface'  First and foremost, he acknowledged the hurt he had caused and the ""racist history of blackface"" that he should have been aware of. When a reporter referred to ""makeup,"" Trudeau corrected him.  ""I appreciate you calling it makeup, but it was blackface. And that is just not right,"" Trudeau said. ""It is something that people who live with the kind of discrimination that far too many people do because of the colour of their skin, or their history or their origins or their religion face on a regular basis and I didn't see that from the layers of privilege that I have.""  One take on Trudeau in his youth, offered by friends, is that he grew up understanding the significance of his last name, knowing that he had to be careful about how he acted and not wanting to embarrass his father. His political career has grown around an idea that he should do something with the advantages he was given.  But he has also shown that he can be a ham. He has a performative streak. He can throw himself down a flight of stairs as a party trick. For Halloween in 2017, he showed up to the House of Commons dressed as Clark Kent and pulled open his shirt to reveal the Superman logo.  And he was unquestionably a child of privilege: raised at 24 Sussex Drive in Ottawa's tony Rockcliffe neighbourhood, educated at Montreal's prestigious Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf and then McGill.  That doesn't excuse anything, but it might be part of an explanation.  ""I have always acknowledged that I come from a place of privilege, but I now need to acknowledge that that comes with a massive blind spot,"" he said.    'I was embarrassed'  Trudeau could not explain why he did it. Nor could he account for precisely when it dawned on him that blackface was wrong. Maybe such things are difficult to pinpoint, but he might be asked again to try.  He also could not say with certainty how many times he did something so insensitive — a politician's hedge against being contradicted later, but a shaky response on a human level.  He faced up to the fact that he hadn't faced up to this before yesterday.  ""I never talked about this,"" he said. ""Quite frankly, I was embarrassed. It was not something that represents the person I've become, the leader I try to be and it was really embarrassing.""  Three years ago or six years ago this could have been offered proactively and addressed as part of his personal evolution. Four weeks short of an election, he risks paying an incredible cost for not having dealt with this earlier.  Asked about Canada's international reputation, Trudeau broadened the conversation to acknowledge systemic discrimination and the very real barriers and pain that racialized Canadians still face.  He might try to place his own story within that history and that reality. Or perhaps it would be better if racialized voices took that lead first. Either way, there is a story to tell.     Not good enough  Trudeau has been strident on issues of diversity — though also capable of restraint, as displayed during a town hall in January — and he might not regret having pushed that message. But he will be pursued by charges of hypocrisy and questions about how the Liberal campaign has pursued the past errors of Conservative candidates. When you claim ideals, you can be punished for not living up to them.  Ultimately the conversation may turn to what his government has done to address discrimination and what more must be done.   ""I've had to reflect on the fact that wanting to do good and wanting to do better simply isn't good enough,"" Trudeau said, ""and you need to take responsibility for mistakes that hurt people who thought I was an ally, who... hopefully many of them still consider me an ally even though this was a terrible mistake.""  Trudeau spoke on Thursday of having to explain himself to his children (and his eyes got red as he recounted that). He called members of his caucus yesterday before Time magazine's story was published. And he spoke privately with Liberal candidates and community leaders before addressing reporters in Winnipeg.  He will need to keep talking and trying to explain.  ""The apologies for things past are important to make sure that we actually understand and know and share and don't repeat those mistakes,"" Trudeau said in 2017, speaking of his government's official acknowledgements.  The past must be reckoned with for the sake of the future — be it the future of Canada, the future of Justin Trudeau, or both.",politics
70,Peeling paint on your white Toyota? Help may be on the way,"Peeling paint has plagued some Toyota owners, and now the automaker says it will do something about it.  But just what it will do is not yet clear.  Toyota Canada told CBC News this week it plans to follow the lead of Toyota USA, which is offering a ""voluntary customer support program"" for owners of affected vehicles.   ""We will be launching a similar support program for impacted customers in Canada,"" Toyota Canada spokesperson David Shum said in an email.  Shum provided no other details, but said that once the program is ready, owners of all affected vehicles will be notified by mail.   The Toyota USA notification went out recently to affected owners in that country.  Vehicles with white paint affected  The company acted in response to reports of peeling paint on certain vehicles with the original factory-applied ""blizzard pearl"" or ""super white"" paint colours.  ""These reports indicate that vehicles with these specific paint colours, applied during the vehicle manufacturing process, may experience paint peeling on exterior metal body parts,""  the notice said.  It said the problem may occur ""when sunlight over time degrades the adhesion between the factory-applied paint primer coat layer and the base metal electrodeposition layer causing the paint to peel from the metal body panel.""  Owners anxious for details  Rachel Mosley, who lives in Prospect, N.S., was the first to bring the story to CBC's attention. Her 2011 RAV4 had small paint peeling spots that continued to grow.  ""I'm not able to wash the vehicle because as soon as I wash it then the paint comes off,"" she said in September 2018.  She complained to Toyota, but like others, was told the warranty on her vehicle had expired.     Mosley is pleased Toyota is finally taking responsibility and said she's looking forward to the details of the program.  Aisha Alam's six-year-old son was the first to notice the paint peeling on her 2013 RAV4 with white ""blizzard pearl"" paint in June.  ""He said 'Mom, your car is broken,'"" said Alam, who lives in Kitchener, Ont.  It was then she noticed that the paint had come off on the driver's side of the vehicle.  ""It's a lot worse now,"" she said. ""There's a huge chunk of paint now missing on the sunroof and there's random places all over where it's just starting to chip.""  'Repaint it properly'  Alam said she spoke with several Toyota representatives and dealerships, and was told by a representative earlier this week that she could ""possibly"" get 50 per cent of the cost of repairing her vehicle.  But she said that was not acceptable.  She's relieved to hear that Toyota will be doing something, and made a suggestion as to what that should be.  ""Toyota should take the whole car and repaint it properly,"" she said, noting the problem is not caused by owners and the peeling isn't isolated to just one area.  Neither Toyota Canada nor Toyota USA has released details of the program.  The mailout to affected customers doesn't say whether vehicles will be completely repainted, whether Toyota will pay the entire bill, or exactly what years and models with the specified white paint will be covered.    It does reference those who previously paid for their own repairs and outlines a process for those customers to be reimbursed, but it doesn't say whether they will get all of their money back or just some of it.  George Iny, director of the Automobile Protection Association ⁠— a consumer advocacy group ⁠— said he is pleased and surprised to hear Toyota Canada plans to repair the vehicles.  ""What we would like to see is lifetime coverage but a one-time repair,"" he said. ""You come in, we look at your vehicle no matter how old it is and we fix it in those areas that one time.""  He said he expects Toyota to pay 100 per cent of the cost to repair damaged areas.  Iny said that because many of the affected vehicles are older, it's important for owners to update their contact information by either going into a dealership or calling Toyota Canada.

151,Major WeWork investor may move to fire its CEO as troubled IPO plans near,"Japan's SoftBank Group Corp, the biggest investor in WeWork owner The We Company, is exploring ways to replace Adam Neumann as chief executive of the U.S. office-sharing start-up, four people familiar with the matter said on Sunday.  The rare showdown between SoftBank and one of its biggest investments comes after We Company postponed its initial public offering (IPO) last week, following pushback from prospective investors, not just over its widening losses, but also over Neumann's unusually firm grip on the company.  This was a blow for SoftBank, which was hoping for We Company's IPO to bolster its profits as it seeks to woo investors for its second $108 billion Vision Fund. It invested in We Company at a $47 billion valuation in January, yet stock market investor skepticism led to the start-up considering a potential valuation in the IPO earlier this month of as low as $10 billion, Reuters reported.  What was the venture capital world's biggest upset is now morphing into one of corporate America's most high-profile boardroom dramas.    Some We Company board directors are deliberating how to replace Neumann as CEO, the sources said. The exact number of directors opposed to Neumann is not clear. Venture capital firm Benchmark Capital, another big investor in We Company, would also like Neumann to step aside, one of the sources said.  Benchmark, SoftBank and Chinese private equity firm Hony Capital each have one representative on We Company's seven-member board, that includes Neumann. Hony Capital's position on whether Neumann should remain CEO could not immediately be learned.  A formally unaffiliated We Company board director, retired Goldman Sachs Group Inc investment banker Mark Schwartz, previously sat on SoftBank's board.  No challenge to Neumann has yet been tabled, the sources said. A We Company board meeting will be held this week, and the issue of his leadership could be raised then, the sources added.  One option that SoftBank is considering is asking Neumann to become interim CEO while a headhunting firm is hired to find an external replacement, the first source said.    The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. We Company and SoftBank declined to comment, while Neumann, Schwartz, Benchmark Capital and Hony Capital could not be immediately reached for comment. The Wall Street Journal first reported on SoftBank exploring ways to replace Neumann as CEO.  As co-founder of the We Company, Neumann holds special voting shares that enable him to dismiss dissident board directors and shoot down any challenge to his authority. However, SoftBank could choose not to back We Company's IPO or provide it with more funding. It has already funded the cash-burning start-up to the tune of $10 billion US, and was discussing committing another $1 billion US to the IPO.  We Company said last week it is aiming to become a publicly traded company by the end of the year.  In a sign of souring relations between SoftBank and WeWork, Neumann did not participate in a gathering of executives of companies backed by SoftBank that took place in Pasadena, California, last week and was organized by SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, according to two people familiar with the matter.  Were a board challenge against Neumann to prove successful, it could follow the template of Uber Technologies Inc.  Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick resigned as CEO of the ride-hailing start-up in 2017 after facing a rebellion from his board over a string of scandals, including allegations of enabling a chauvinistic and toxic work culture. Uber replaced Kalanick with an outsider, former Expedia Group Inc CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, and completed its IPO last May.  Pushing the envelope  It is not uncommon for founders of fast-growing start-ups to be eccentric and control their companies tightly, even as they seek to attract stock market investors. Neumann, however, was criticized by investors and corporate governance experts for arrangements that went beyond the typical practice of having majority voting control through special categories of shares.  These included giving his estate a major say in his replacement as CEO, and tying the voting power of shares to how much he donates to charitable causes.  Neumann also entered into several transactions with We Company over the years, making the company a tenant in some of his properties and charging it rent. He has also secured a $500 million credit line from banks using company stock as collateral.  Following criticism by potential investors, Neumann agreed to some concessions without relinquishing majority control. He agreed to give We Company any profit he receives from real estate deals he has entered in to with the New York-based start-up.  No member of Neumann's family will be on the company's board and any successor will be selected by the board, scrapping a plan for his wife and co-founder, Rebekah Neumann, to help pick the successor.  These changes did little to address concerns about We Company's business model, which rents out workspace to clients under short-term contracts, even though it pays rent for them itself under long-term leases. This mix of long-term liabilities and short-term revenue raised questions among investors about how the company would weather an economic downturn.",business
194,"Canadians' trust in science falling, poll suggests","A survey suggests that the trust Canadians place in science may be eroding.  The survey, by the polling firm Ipsos for the multinational 3M company, also found that nearly half of those surveyed thought scientists are elitist and that a significant number of respondents discounted findings that don't accord with their personal beliefs.  ""While science skeptics represent the minority of Canadians, their number is increasing,"" said Richard Chartrand of 3M Canada. ""This trend is concerning because it shows that distrust is growing.""  The Canadian figures are from a global survey of more than 14,000 people between July and September 2018. It's the second year 3M has done the research.  At a time when accelerating climate change and wildlife loss are placing science at the top of the public agenda, the survey found 32 per cent of respondents were skeptical about it. That was up from 25 per cent the previous year.  ""It moved from one person out of four to one person out of three,"" Chartrand said. ""It's difficult for us to understand why.""  The study's results were conflicting. While doubt was growing, nine out of 10 respondents said they still trusted research results.  Answers to other questions showed that trust to be wary.  Nearly half — 44 per cent — said they considered scientists ""elitists.""  Of those who said they were skeptical of science, about one-third felt scientists were influenced by government agendas. Another third thought science has been swayed by corporate agendas.  And 30 per cent said they only believed science that aligned with their personal beliefs.  Other findings have echoed this survey.  'Depressing but not too surprising'  A 2017 Leger poll for the Ontario Science Centre found 29 per cent of respondents thought that because scientific theories are subject to challenge, they can't be trusted. Another question suggested 43 per cent considered science to be a matter of opinion.  ""It's depressing but not too surprising,"" said John Smol, an ecologist at Queen's University who has written about the issue. ""There's a real disconnect between what scientists do and what is the perception in the public.""  Smol fears Canadians don't understand how science works — that data, not belief, is what counts and that science advances when old beliefs are upended, not shored up by unspoken consensus.  ""There are certainly misconceptions,"" he said. ""You can't blame them. It's a jungle of misinformation out there.""  It's not all the public's fault, said Stephen Johnston, chairman of earth and atmospheric sciences at the University of Alberta.  ""We have to make an effort to communicate in terms that are understandable,"" he said.  ""There used to be an ethic in science that the lower the number of people who actually understood what you did, the better you are doing. That is turning around.""  Smol agreed.  ""We have a real responsibility to make [science] accessible. We're still doing a relatively poor job of translating the data — by and large paid for by taxpayers — and passing it to the public.""    The poll did show curiosity about science. Almost all respondents thought findings should be shared in easily understandable language and 88 per cent wished they knew more about science.  ""I look at these results and think they're quite positive,"" said Johnston. ""People appreciate that science is a necessary thing. There's an insatiable appetite for science.""  The bridge between the public and the lab must be bridged, said Chartrand.  ""There's a clear message in this survey.""",technology
144,Canadian special forces armoured truck stolen in Iraq during Mosul liberation,"Call it a cold case in a hot place.  At the height of the battle to retake Mosul in early 2017, northern Iraq was a sketchy neighbourhood — a place where even broken-down wrecks weren't safe.  Canadian special forces operators were reminded of that fact when one of their armoured pickup trucks was stolen from a training range — a case that left military police scratching their heads.  According to documents obtained by CBC News under access to information law, the theft was reported to the military's criminal investigation branch in March 2017, almost a month after the Toyota Hilux was discovered missing from a range west of Erbil which had been used to train local Kurdish fighters.  According to internal Department of National Defence documents, the vehicle had reached the end of its life cycle and was no longer serviceable.  During the Afghan war, the Canadian army routinely destroyed disabled vehicles to prevent them from falling into insurgent hands — a practice known as ""BIPing"" (Blow in Place).  Pickup stripped of military equipment  That wasn't the policy in Iraq, however. According to the documents, the Hilux was to be used as a ""training aid"" because it had a broken rear hatch, a damaged right door and ""major drivetrain issues.""  The pickup had been stripped of Canadian radios, electronics and other military equipment, said an April 12, 2017, summary of the military police investigation.  The special forces contingent left it unattended on the training range on Feb. 4, 2017. They learned it had disappeared 10 days later when they arrived back in the area after a forward deployment assisting Iraqi security forces as they fought a prolonged battle with entrenched Islamic State militants in Mosul.    ""Security measures had been arranged but as the vehicle had been demilitarized and was to be used for training purposes, it could be left unattended on the range,"" said Dan LeBouthillier, a Department of National Defence spokesman.  The documents noted the pickup was carried to the range on a flatbed truck.  The theft was the only incident of its kind during the Canadian advise-and-assist training mission in Iraq, LeBouthillier said.  The documents show military police interviewed Kurdish commanders and local fighters, all of whom claimed ignorance about the missing truck.  Looking for suspects  At times, the partially redacted internal reports read like a dark comedy as they describe how a pair of investigators navigated the dangerous and surreal landscape looking for suspects and traces of the vehicle.  Interviews were conducted through a translator and were sometimes sidelined by the capricious timetable of some Kurdish commanders — one of whom didn't show up for his interview and had to be reached by phone at an undisclosed location.  ""He did not have any new information on the missing vehicle's location, nor did he identify any possible suspects,"" said the report, which did not identify the Kurdish commander.   ""He will canvas his troops on the matter.""  One Canadian soldier, whose name was blanked out in the documents, said he searched local scrap yards and ""believes the vehicle may have been taken by local farmers or inhabitants to eventually sell it for parts in the scrap yard.""    Military officials were most concerned about the fact that the vehicle still contained its armour plating, which was slipped between the pickup frame and the interior.  The theft came at a time when Islamic State extremists were known to be building massive suicide trucks using scrap metal bolted to ordinary vehicles.  In 2016-17, multiple U.S. media reports warned that ISIS mechanics were skilled in creating ""professional-grade"" armoured vehicles out of scrap.  However, the unidentified Canadian soldier told investigators ""the probability of the [pickup] being taken by the enemy is very negligible"" because the range was located near Kurdish checkpoints, who would have spotted it being stolen.  The investigation ended, according to the documents, with no suspects, no forensic evidence and no vehicle.",politics
67,Colt suspends production of AR-15 rifle for civilian market,"Gun-maker Colt is suspending its production of rifles for the civilian market including the popular AR-15, the company said Thursday in a shift it attributed to changes in consumer demand and a market already saturated with similar weapons.  The company said it will focus instead on fulfilling contracts with military and police customers for rifles.  ""The fact of the matter is that over the last few years, the market for modern sporting rifles has experienced significant excess manufacturing capacity,"" Colt's CEO, Dennis Veilleux, said in a written statement. ""Given this level of manufacturing capacity, we believe there is adequate supply for modern sporting rifles for the foreseeable future.""  Veilleux said the company, which emerged from bankruptcy in 2016, remains committed to the right to bear arms, as spelled out in the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. He said the company is expanding its lines of pistols and revolvers.  Despite a national debate on gun control, Colt's decision seems driven by business considerations rather than politics, said Adam Winkler, a gun policy expert at the University of California, Los Angeles School of Law.  FBI statistics show more than 2.3 million people applied for background checks to purchase guns in August, up from just over 1.8 million in July. Those applications, the best available statistic from tracking gun sales, have been rising steadily, with a slight decline after Donald Trump was elected president in 2016, something called the ""Trump slump.""  Gun sales usually go up when gun buyers feel their access to such weapons is being threatened, Winkler said.    ""Given these sales and the history of Colt being a completely disorganized, dysfunctional company that goes into bankruptcy and can't keep anything going properly, my assumption is that this is a business decision that is being driven by their own business problems,"" he said.  Still, Winkler said the company's decision risks alienating and angering its remaining customer base.  ""We've seen in the past that when gun manufacturers are viewed to have given in to gun-safety advocates, gun owners will boycott them and really hurt their business,"" he said. ""If they think a company like Colt is disrespecting their identity or giving in to the other side, Colt's likely going to see serious damage to its other firearms brands too.""  The debate on gun control has focused in particular on assault-style rifles like AR-15s that have been used in mass shootings.  Democratic presidential candidate and former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke, whose hometown of El Paso was the site of a shooting in August left 22 people dead, has been pushing for mandatory rifle buybacks over the last few weeks.    ""Hell, yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47, and we're not going to allow it to be used against your fellow Americans anymore,"" O'Rourke said, during a Democratic presidential debate this month.  The parents of a young woman killed in the 2017 Las Vegas massacre filed a wrongful death lawsuit in July against Colt and seven other gun manufacturers, along with gun shops in Nevada and Utah, arguing their weapons are designed to be easily modified to fire like automatic weapons.  In Connecticut, gun-maker Remington is facing a lawsuit involving liability for the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in which a Bushmaster AR-15-style rifle used to kill 20 first graders and six educators on Dec. 14, 2012.",business
45,What would happen if Justin Trudeau resigned mid-campaign?,"The first photo of Justin Trudeau in blackface makeup was released Wednesday, Sept. 18. Within hours, more photos surfaced of Trudeau dressed up with a darkened face.  When pressed the next day to state whether there were any more such images, Trudeau said, ""I am wary of being definitive about this.""  How many photos do we know of?  There are least three photos and one video of Trudeau wearing racist makeup.  The story broke the evening of Wednesday, Sept. 18 with the publication by Time Magazine of a photo from a 2001 yearbook from the Vancouver private school West Point Grey Academy, where Trudeau taught. The school staged an Arabian Nights-themed gala. Trudeau dressed as Aladdin, in blackface and a turban.  Time reported that it obtained the photo from Vancouver businessman Michael Adamson, who was identified as being ""part of the West Point Grey Academy community.""    A second photo from the same gala surfaced later Wednesday evening. It had been printed in the school's newsletter.    Trudeau was asked on Wednesday by CBC reporter David Cochrane if there were any other, similar incidents he should divulge. Trudeau said there was one other incident, dating from when he was in a high school talent show at Montreal's Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf. He wore blackface to sing Harry Belefonte's hit Day O (Banana Boat Song).    The next day, Global News released a video it obtained of Trudeau, again in blackface. It came from an unidentified event, but the Liberal Party confirmed that it was indeed Trudeau in the 1990s. Global reported it obtained the video from a source in the Conservative Party.    How did Trudeau react?  Trudeau held an emergency news conference Wednesday evening on his campaign plane. He apologized and said he ""should have known better.""  ""I take responsibility for my decision to do that. I shouldn't have done it,"" he said. ""I should have known better. It was something that I didn't think was racist at the time, but now I recognize it was something racist to do and I am deeply sorry.""  Watch his full apology and answers to reporter questions:    What would happen if Trudeau resigned mid-campaign?  It would be an unprecedented event in Canadian politics — so political scientists have been mulling over how it might play out.  They all point to the Liberal Party's constitution — which outlines what happens when a leader resigns and an interim needs to be chosen — rather than the Elections Act. A leader dropping out mid-campaign is not explicitly mentioned in the party's constitution. One section does give some guidance, though: it states the national board of directors would appoint an interim leader in consultation with caucus.  But dealing with a caucus becomes tricky after Parliament is dissolved. Kelly Blidook, who teaches political science at Newfoundland's Memorial University, said he thinks the board ""technically"" could name an interim leader without caucus consultation.  ""But I am reasonably certain in such a case that there would be a selective consultation of senior or longtime elected Liberals,"" he wrote in an email.  The timeline would be incredibly tight, though — maybe impossible.  ""There is simply not enough time to formally select a new leader during the campaign,"" said Matthew Kerby, who has taught political science at Memorial and the University of Ottawa and now teaches at Australian National University.  ""Strategically, it would be a terrible idea as it would leave the party rudderless and would also be a tacit admission of defeat before election day.""  What has Trudeau said about resigning?  Asked Wednesday evening if he should resign as Liberal leader, Trudeau argued that incidents like these should be approached on a ""case-by-case"" basis.  ""There are people who make mistakes in this life and you make decisions based on what they actually do, what they did and on a case-by-case basis. I deeply regret that I did that. I should have known better, but I didn't,"" he said.  Asked on Thursday if he'd considered stepping aside to let someone else lead the party through the election, Trudeau did not answer directly but said he would ""continue to do the work that is necessary to keep us moving forward in the right way.""    How did the other leaders react?  Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer: A few hours after the first photo surfaced, Scheer said he was extremely shocked and disappointed.  ""Wearing brownface is an act of open mockery and racism. It was just as racist in 2001 as it is in 2019,"" he said. ""And what Canadians saw this evening was someone with a complete lack of judgment and integrity and someone who is not fit to govern this country.""  NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh: Singh said Trudeau's behaviour was ""troubling"" and ""insulting.""   ""It's making a mockery of someone for what they live and what their lived experiences are,"" he said. ""I think he needs to answer for it. I think he needs to answer the question why he did that and what does that say about what he thinks about people who, because of who they are, because of the colour of their skin, face challenges and barriers and obstacles in their life.""  Singh said it's not up to him to say whether Trudeau should be prime minister, leaving that decision to voters.  Green Party Leader Elizabeth May: May tweeted Wednesday night that she was deeply shocked.    On Thursday, she said, she does not believe Trudeau is racist. ""At that point in his life, I think you'd have to say he was unconsciously racist. I would not say today the man I know is a racist. But I could not imagine that photo, either.""  Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet: Blanchet said Thursday that he is ""sincerely convinced"" that Trudeau is not a racist.  ""But I am as much sincerely convinced that it shows, or his reaction shows, or his lack of anticipation of this problem shows that he does not have the required qualities to be the prime minister of a country being a member of the G7.""  People's Party Leader Maxime Bernier: Bernier tweeted Wednesday that he wasn't going to accuse Trudeau of being a racist but he did think ""he was the biggest hypocrite in the country.""  ""He's the master of identity politics and the [Liberals] just spent months accusing everyone of being white supremacists.""  How did the Liberal Party react?  The Liberal Party confirmed that all the photos and the video were of Justin Trudeau, but did not issue an official statement.  How have Liberal candidates reacted?  Greg Fergus, a black Liberal MP seeking re-election in Hull-Aylmer, Que., said Trudeau should be judged on his ""great record"" on promoting equality and diversity, not on things that happened nearly 20 years in the past.  ""I think those are really the measure of the man and that's the reason why I have confidence in his continuing leadership,"" he said.  Watch Fergus and other Liberal MPs of colour react:    Omar Alghabra, who is seeking re-election as a Liberal MP for Mississauga Centre, said his heart sank when he saw the photos.   ""The person I know of Justin Trudeau for the last seven or eight years is a champion against intolerance and racism. Not just lip service, but with real deeds and real action. That is the Justin Trudeau I know. I can't explain those pictures.""  Amarjeet Sohi, who served as natural resources minister and is seeking re-election in Edmonton Mill Woods, issued a strong statement condemning the images.  ""I was very disheartened and disappointed to see these images. These indefensible images bring back many painful memories of racism that I and other racialized Canadians have experienced throughout their lives,"" he said.    Catherine McKenna, who served as environment and climate change minister under Trudeau, said what the Liberal leader did was a mistake but she would not be running if she didn't believe in him.  Watch McKenna explain why she is standing behind him:    Trudeau said that when he darkened his face 20 years ago, he did not realize it was a racist act. He said he recognizes now that it is.  But many Canadians have said that they don't consider it racist and that it was just part of a costume.  This article explains why wearing brownface or blackface is considered ""reprehensible.""",politics
191,"Thousands of young people hospitalized due to cannabis and other substance use, report reveals","About 65 young people in Canada per day land in hospital because of harm caused by cannabis, alcohol, opioids and other substances, according to a new report.  Clinicians and a former user say the findings from the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) highlight the desperate need for more community supports to help those with mental health concerns.  The institute released the report, titled ""Hospital stays for harm caused by substance use among youth age 10 to 24,"" on Thursday. The figures present a snapshot of the hospital stays in those age groups in 2017-2018, before the legalization of cannabis.  Last year, more than 23,500 youth were hospitalized for harm from substance use, the report says. In comparison, about 8,000 were hospitalized for illnesses related to the appendix.   The findings highlight the need to focus attention on youth who experience harm caused by substance use and have mental health conditions occurring at the same time, as well as those who live in lower-income or rural and remote areas, the report's authors said.  Cannabis accounted for nearly 40 per cent of those hospital stays among youth, followed by alcohol-related hospitalizations at about 26 per cent.  Missed opportunities  Dr. Joanna Henderson, a psychologist and senior scientist at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto, says the report shows perspectives on substance abuse need to expand, especially when nearly 70 per cent of the hospitalizations for harm caused by substance use involve mental health conditions, as well.  That's nearly double the proportion among those aged 25 and older.  ""We need adequate services in the hospital but we also need to be thinking about how are we intervening sooner,"" said Henderson, who was not involved in the research.     ""We are missing opportunities like schools, local malls … where young people are.""  Young people need places in communities that are one-stop shops to connect them with employment, education, housing and health services, including mental health and substance use, she said.  'You're not alone'  Lucas Wade, 31, first started smoking cannabis at 17 ""out of peer pressure,"" he said.  At age 20, he was toking daily for pleasure along with boozing.   ""I was admitted to hospital after my roommate found me after trying to suicide because I couldn't stop smoking pot, no matter what,"" Wade said. ""I couldn't keep living that way.""  Wade ended up homeless when a landlord evicted him for smoking indoors after signing a contract saying he wouldn't.    Wade studied social work and now works as a support counselor in Toronto, where he sees many youth with underlining mental health issues using substances as a coping mechanism.  The first step is to talk to someone close to you, such as a best friend, parent or sibling, Wade said.  ""If you're the youth, find a safe space or people where you can share and talk about this stuff because it is so hard. When you're in the throes of it, you feel so alone. You're not alone.""  Previous research suggests young people with pre-existing mental health concerns can be at higher risk for problematic substance use and it occur in the other direction as well, Henderson said.  It's important not only to collect consistent data across Canada regularly to find any changes but to speak to young people about their experience with how services are delivered, she added.    About 17 per cent of the youth were hospitalized more than once in the same fiscal year, according to CIHI. That's another red flag for the need for better community supports, clinicians say.  Hospitalization rates varied by province and territory. The hospital stays are ""the tip of the iceberg when it comes to estimating harm caused by substance use,"" CIHI said, and doesn't include fatal overdoses in the community.

172,9 gripe water brands recalled because of microbial contamination,"Various brands of gripe water used to treat stomach upset in babies are under recall because of potential microbial contamination, Health Canada said.  RW Consumer Products Ltd. is recalling all lots of the product ""Gripe Water – Alcohol And Preservative Free"" after the company's testing showed contamination.  The brand names include:     Shoppers Drug Mart's Life Brand.   The Walmart brand Equate.   Rexall's brand Be Better.   Pharmasave.   Atoma.   Baby's Choice.   Personnelle.   Teddy's Choice.   Western Family    Stores across Canada sold the recalled products, which carry the Natural Product Number or NPN 80080669.    These products are marketed as a ""gentle antacid for quick relief of baby's minor stomach upsets such as colic, cramps, gas, sour stomach, and hiccups especially during teething.""  Health Canada said ingesting a contaminated product may pose serious health risks. Microbial contamination can increase the risk of infection, particularly in infants. Their developing immune systems may be more susceptible to infection.  Symptoms of a microbial infection in infants include:     Vomiting and watery diarrhea.   Fever.   Abdominal pain.    The regulator advised consumers to stop giving affected products to your baby.  Health Canada also suggested consult a health-care professional if a baby used the product and you have concerns about the child's health.  Consumers are asked to return any unused product to the place of purchase.  Health Canada will monitor the company's recall and inform Canadians if new safety information becomes available.",health
11,Saudi energy minister says oil production will be back to normal by end of September,"Saudi Arabia's new energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said Tuesday that his country's oil market will be fully back online by the end of September.  Speaking at a press conference in Jeddah Tuesday, Prince Abdulaziz said production would be at 9.890 million barrels per day in October. He also said that 50 per cent of the production cut resulting from a recent drone attack has already been restored.  The kingdom sought to calm markets on Tuesday after an unprecedented attack on its oil facilities, with sources saying output was recovering much more quickly than initially forecast and could be fully back in two or three weeks.  Saturday's attacks raised the spectre of a major supply shock in a market that in recent months has been preoccupied with demand concerns and faltering global growth. Oil surged as much as 20 per cent at one point on Monday.  Brent crude was down $3.72 US, or 5.4 per cent, at $65.30 a barrel by 8:50 a.m. ET. West Texas Intermediate was down $2.40, or 3.8 per cent, at $60.50 a barrel.  In the immediate fallout from the attacks, state-owned producer Saudi Aramco told some Asian refiners it would meet its oil commitments, albeit with changes, sources said.      We need a proper damage assessment, we need to see a recovery plan.  — Samuel Ciszuk, analyst     ""All eyes will be on the Saudi news conference,"" said Samuel Ciszuk, founding partner at Stockholm-based ELS Analysis.  ""We need a proper damage assessment, we need to see a recovery plan. Before that, we don't really know how much oil will be offline for how long, and that's the basic question people having been posing since Saturday.""  Biggest single oil disruption in 50 years  The attacks on crude-processing facilities at Abqaiq and Khurais resulted in the largest single supply disruption in half a century, and threw into question Saudi Arabia's status as supplier of last resort.  Some Asian refineries are expected to receive their allocated volumes for October, while other importers are being told of delays or being offered alternative grades.    The prospect of oil releases from strategic inventories in the United States, the International Energy Agency and countries such as Japan have weighed on prices, but the geopolitical threat of retaliation is causing concerns.  U.S. Vice-President Mike Pence said on Tuesday the United States was evaluating evidence on the attacks and stands ready to defend its interests and allies in the Middle East.  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was travelling to Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, Pence said in a speech at the Heritage Institute think-tank. If Iran conducted Saturday's attacks to pressure U.S. President Donald Trump to back off his sanctions regime against Tehran, they will fail, Pence said.    Relations between the United States and Iran have deteriorated since Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear accord last year and reimposed sanctions on its oil exports.    Tehran rejects the charges it was behind the strikes and on Tuesday ruled out talks with Trump. Saudi King Salman meanwhile called on governments around the world to confront the threats to oil supplies.  Washington also wants to pressure Tehran to end its support for regional proxy forces, including in Yemen where Saudi forces have been fighting Iran-backed Houthis for four years. The Houthis claimed responsibility for Saturday's attacks.

176,"2nd Ebola vaccine to be used in Congo, as UN efforts slammed","The World Health Organization on Monday announced Congo will start using a second experimental Ebola vaccine, as efforts to stop the deadly outbreak are stalled and Doctors Without Borders criticizes vaccination efforts to date.  Since this outbreak was declared in August 2018, more than 200,000 people have received doses of a vaccine made by Merck which will continue to be used in Congo. The U.N. health agency in a statement said the second vaccine, made by Johnson &amp; Johnson, will be used from October in areas where Ebola is not actively spreading.  Using the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine ""will ensure that we have potentially an additional tool to prevent the expansion of the outbreak,"" said Matshidiso Moeti, WHO's Africa director.  So far, more than 3,030 people have been sickened by the Ebola virus in this outbreak, the second-worst in history, and more than 1,990 have died.  The question of whether the Johnson &amp; Johnson experimental vaccine should be used was at the centre of a dispute between Congo's former health minister, Dr. Oly Ilunga and global health officials. Ilunga had insisted Congo would not use the vaccine because he said it wasn't sufficiently tested and would create confusion.  He resigned as the health minister in July after the president replaced him as the head of Congo's Ebola response team. In his resignation letter, Ilunga criticized the ""strong pressure exercised in recent months"" to use the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.    Separately, Doctors Without Borders is seeking an independent committee to oversee Ebola vaccination efforts, similar to those that have been formed internationally to respond to outbreaks of meningitis, yellow fever and cholera.  The medical charity said greater transparency is needed and alleged that WHO is ""restricting the availability"" of the Merck vaccine in the field. Doctors Without Borders, also known by its French acronym, MSF, said the approximately 225,000 people vaccinated so far is ""largely insufficient"" and that between 450,000 and 600,000 people should have been immunized by now.  ""Not enough people are getting the vaccine because of some arbitrary rules that haven't been made clear,"" Dr. Natalie Roberts, emergency co-ordinator for MSF, told The Associated Press.    She said restricting the vaccine to people who are known contacts of Ebola cases is problematic. ""It comes down to very local control, when every morning it's someone from WHO who decides who is going to be vaccinated and how many vials to open,"" she said. ""Trying to restrict eligibility for a vaccine for a disease that everybody is afraid of is just not going to work.""  MSF has described WHO's strategy as ""like giving firefighters a bucket of water to put out a fire, but only allowing them to use one cup of water a day.""  WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said in an email that the limited number of Ebola vaccines needs to be used sparingly.    ""If all doses were sent to (Congo), there would be no reserves available to respond should cases emerge in any of the high-risk neighbouring countries,"" he said.  ""That would jeopardize an effective, speedy response in those high-risk countries."" Beyond Congo, cases have been confirmed in Uganda and some health workers in Rwanda and South Sudan have been vaccinated preventively.  Jasarevic said an international committee like the one called for by MSF is only used for licensed vaccines; both Ebola vaccines remain experimental and have not been approved by any regulatory agencies.    ""When the vaccine is licensed, this would be an appropriate mechanism for managing supply of the vaccine,"" he said.  Roberts said the number of people vaccinated so far is ultimately a damning assessment of response efforts.  ""If you had said at the beginning of the outbreak that we were going to vaccinate this many people, you would assume the outbreak would be over by now,"" she said.

4,Conservatives will review business subsidies in effort to save $1.5 billion,"Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said Wednesday he will start to pay for his promised $9 billion in tax cuts and program spending by finding a way to cut $1.5 billion from annual subsidies to Canadian corporations.  Scheer spent most of Wednesday campaigning at small businesses in Hamilton and Richmond Hill, Ont., trying to drill home his campaign theme of helping the little guy rather than the rich and well-connected. He went first to a barbershop and later to a Chinese bakery.  ""Hard-working Canadians are rightly offended when they see their tax dollars going to further the interests of the wealthy and well-connected friends while Justin Trudeau makes them pay more for gasoline, groceries, and home heating,"" Scheer said.  He said a Conservative government will review all federal business subsidies and eliminate economic-development programs in which the funds benefit shareholders, corporate executives, foreign companies, lobbyists or consultants. Those subsidies and programs total $7 billion now, he said, scattered among numerous departments.  The Conservatives would protect regional economic-development agencies, however, and make sure they're administered by ministers from those regions. They'd also give support to ""strategic industries,"" such as aerospace, if the money stays in the country and creates or protects jobs.    He cited a $12-million subsidy the government gave grocery giant Loblaw to buy more energy-efficient coolers as one example of an expense Conservatives wouldn't support.  Scheer said the Conservatives would have never spent federal funds in other ways the Liberals have, including $220 million to buy energy-efficient gas turbines for the Canada LNG project in British Columbia, and the $4.5-billion purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline.  Infrastructure bank called 'boondoggle in waiting'  He also is gunning for what he called the $35-billion ""boondoggle in waiting"" Canada Infrastructure Bank. The bank is meant to use federal money to spark private investments in things like new highways, bridges and water systems, helping to find projects that could eventually spin off revenue to pay those investments back.  The Tories submitted the promise to the parliamentary budget officer, as they have others; the office said this is not the type of proposal the office can assess.  This is the first announcement Scheer has made in the week-old campaign in which he's talked about cutting government spending rather than forgoing revenue. The Conservatives have thus far pledged tax credits, cuts and grants exceeding $9 billion, which Scheer has said he will pay for by having different priorities from the Liberal government.  John Lester, a former federal government economist who now works as an executive fellow at the University of Calgary's School of Public Policy, said in a 2018 paper that there were about $14 billion in federal government business subsidies in 2014-15. The paper said Ottawa and the four largest provinces in Canada provided $29 billion in subsidies through program spending, mostly through the tax system, with Alberta leading the way at $600 per capita corporate handouts.  The total amount was about half of what the provinces and Ottawa collected in corporate income taxes.  The federal government has been promising under both the former Conservative government and the recent Liberal one to cancel federal fossil fuel subsidies — worth more than $3.3 billion a year — as part of a pledge of all G20 nations to do so. Despite the decade-old promise that Canada has recommitted to every year since, the subsidies have not been cut.  Canada recently joined with Argentina to conduct peer reviews of each other subsidies in a bid to figure out the path to eliminating them.",politics
69,Airbnb to become publicly traded company next year,"Short-term rental company Airbnb says it plans to go public next year and list its shares on the stock exchange.  The company made the announcement in a news release on Thursday, but declined to offer any details about what stock exchange it would list on or how much money it plans to raise in the process.  It would make the company the latest in the so-called ""sharing economy"" to make the move to go public, following ride-hailing firms Uber and Lyft, and the forthcoming initial public offering (IPO) by office space company WeWork later this year.  The IPOs of Uber and Lyft slumped after going public, with investors questioning the two companies' growth potential along with lack of profitability.  WeWork has similarly been hit hard by scrutiny over its finances and fears the company may never turn a profit.  Airbnb, which allows online rental bookings of unused rooms and properties to people looking for short-term stays, has disrupted the hotel and tourism industry in the decade since it was founded in San Francisco in 2008.  Users of Airbnb pay property owners for their short-term stays, similar to the way hotels work, and the company takes a percentage of each deal as its fee.  This week, the company said it took in more than $1 billion US in revenue for the second quarter of 2019, but has declined to say if it is profitable. It has previously said its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization was positive for 2017 and 2018.  The company has also faced backlash in numerous places where it operates. It has been accused of helping property owners avoid paying income taxes on rental income and disrupting rental market balances, and has been accused of fraud and abuse.",business
3,'I was extremely disappointed': Jody Wilson-Raybould responds to Trudeau brownface controversy,"Jody Wilson-Raybould, who was kicked out of the Liberal party caucus in the fallout to the SNC-Lavalin affair, said she was ""extremely disappointed"" after seeing a photo of Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau dressed in brownface.  The photo, published Wednesday in Time Magazine, shows Trudeau dressed up in brownface and a turban in 2001 for a gala at West Point Grey Academy, a private school in Vancouver's west side where he once worked.  ""It's awful,"" Wilson-Raybould told reporters at a campaign rally Wednesday evening. ""When I first saw it, I didn't think it was real.  ""But I will say I'm incredibly proud to be an Indigenous person in this country, one that has experienced racism and discrimination. It's completely unacceptable for anybody in a position of authority and power to do something like that.""    The campaign rally Wednesday also featured Jane Philpott, the former health minister who Trudeau also turfed from his caucus in April.   Philpott's expulsion came after she resigned from the Liberal cabinet and publicly stated she had lost confidence in how the Trudeau government was handling the SNC-Lavalin affair.  Both women are now running as independent candidates.  The two were greeted by more than 200 supporters at the Hellenic Community Centre, just a few kilometres from the private school where Trudeau once worked.  ""It was very disturbing to see the photo for a whole variety of reasons,"" Philpott said.     ""It's the act of racism as well as the fact it's been hidden all these years. Those are concerning things. The position of prime minister is a position of high esteem and we expect the very best of our leaders.""    Green Party Leader Elizabeth May made a surprise appearance at the rally to support both candidates. When asked if she thought Trudeau was racist, May said much of the racism in Canada is unconscious.  ""At that point in his life, I think you'd have to say he was unconsciously racist,"" May said of Trudeau. ""I would not say today the man I know is a racist. But I could not imagine that photo either.""  May noted that the Liberal leader quickly apologized for the brownface incident, but has yet to apologize to Wilson-Raybould after Canada's ethics commissioner found Trudeau inappropriately tried to influence Wilson-Raybould when she was attorney general.",politics
127,An old photo of Stephen Harper in Indigenous garb is being misrepresented online,"In the wake of Liberal leader Justin Trudeau's blackface scandal, an image of Stephen Harper is being shared online showing the former prime minister wearing an Indigenous headdress and face paint.  Those posting the images are attempting to draw parallels between the images of Trudeau wearing blackface makeup and the photo of Harper. But Harper wasn't wearing a costume at the time — he was taking part in a ceremony naming him an honorary chief.    In 2011, Harper was given the ceremonial title by the Blood Tribe in southern Alberta. As part of the ceremony, Blood Tribe elder Pete Standing Alone painted Harper's face and placed a headdress of eagle feathers on his head.  The title is considered a great honour and has been bestowed upon other world leaders, including Prince Charles and Pope John Paul II. In 2016, Trudeau himself was given an aboriginal name by the Tsuut'ina First Nation during a ceremony that saw him presented with a traditional headdress, which he subsequently wore.  But many people are sharing the photo of Harper on Facebook and Twitter without this context. One Facebook post of the photo, which has been shared more than 5,600 times, includes the caption: ""Stephen Harper is astounded at Trudeaus [sic] racist costume from 20 years ago ...""    ""The chiefs chose to put a headdress on Harper and they brought in people from their faith and they coloured his face. It was all part of a cultural and religious ceremony,"" said Robert Jago a Montreal-based writer and a member of the Kwantlen First Nation.  ""When you point to that and you point at the colour on his face and you laugh at it, you're not laughing at Harper. You're laughing at the people that put the colour there.""  Jago tweeted about the image over the weekend after seeing it shared by several people on Facebook. He said there's a stark difference between the photo of Harper at that ceremony and the images of Trudeau wearing blackface.   ""People are partisans and don't really appreciate what the actual issue is, or they don't want to engage with it, so they'd rather deflect and say, 'Everybody does this,'"" Jago said.  ""But if you're saying that participating in a ceremony from another religion or another culture is the same as Trudeau's minstrel acts, you are being really cruel towards minorities, and sharing the same level of ignorance that Trudeau says he got over after 2001.""",politics
5,Trudeau promises more financial supports for seniors — but no independent accounting,"The Liberals are offering new financial supports for seniors — but no independent analysis of how much they would cost Canadians.  During a campaign event in Fredericton, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau announced that a re-elected government led by him would provide a 10 per cent boost to Old Age Security (OAS) at age 75 and a 25 per cent increase to the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) for widows.  According to the Liberal Party, the OAS increase would give Canadians aged 75 and older an extra $729 each year and lift 20,000 seniors out of poverty.  The increase would take effect in July 2020 and would be indexed to keep up with inflation. The full value of the benefit would be received by every senior who makes less than $77,580 today.  Widows or widowers would receive up to $2,080 in additional benefits every year with the increased survivor's benefit under the CPP and Quebec Pension Plan (QPP).    Asked if Canadians would be required to pay higher premiums to pay for the increase, Trudeau did not provide a clear answer.  ""That's a conversation that we're going to be having with the provinces,"" he said.    Trudeau said losing a partner is one of the hardest things to endure, and this added support will help during the period of grief.  ""Seniors have built the Canada that we know and love today. And they deserve to enjoy their golden years to the fullest,"" Trudeau said during a campaign event in Fredericton.  Dan Kelly, president and CEO of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, warned that the boost in CPP could come at a big cost.  ""CPP premiums are already set to rise by 20 per cent over the next few years. Canadians should be informed of the costs of the new Liberal Party promise to boost survivors' pensions. This could be a big one and cost jobs. Also, seven provinces would need to agree before it goes ahead,"" Kelly said in a statement to CBC.  One national seniors' advocacy group applauded the measures. The Canadian Association for Retired Persons (CARP) said a survey of its members found 64 per cent were worried about outliving their savings in retirement.  ""Seniors poverty is a growing concern. The Liberals' proposed OAS increase would make a real difference to Canada's poorest seniors. And the proposed increase to the CPP survivor benefit is critically important to income security, especially for widowed women,"" CARP said in a statement.  According to background materials, the Liberal Party estimates the OAS increase would cost $1.63 billion in 2020-21, rising to $2.56 billion in 2023-24.  No independent costing  Costing analysis by the Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO) was not provided.  Trudeau is facing criticism for not providing the independent analysis of Liberal platform commitments, as the Conservatives and NDP have been doing. Today, he said only some parts of the platform would be subjected to the PBO's scrutiny.  ""We will be releasing a fully costed, fully responsible platform in the coming weeks, including all the work done by the Parliamentary Budget Officer on specific measures,"" he said.  The Liberals extended the mandate of the PBO to cost party platforms during election campaigns. The Liberals made a campaign promise in 2015 to ""help Canadians make informed decisions during elections"" and give Canadians a ""credible, non-partisan way to compare each party's fiscal plans.""  All requests for PBO cost analysis come from the parties, and the service is not mandatory.  Something to hide?  But Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said Trudeau's decision not to release costing with each campaign commitment, as his party has done, shows he has something to hide.  ""Obviously the Liberals have a terrible fiscal record that they are ashamed of,"" Scheer said during a campaign event in Hamilton, Ont. ""I believe that's why they're not participating in the very process that they themselves set up.""    Asked if the volume of requests has caused any delay or backlog, Sloane Mask, PBO's director of parliamentary relations and planning, told CBC this week the PBO ""is meeting the current demand"" for requests. The timing of the release of platform costing is up to the parties, she said.  If the PBO is unable to complete a cost estimate, the request and the reason it could not be completed will be published on its website, Mask said.  Speaking about the new election costing mandate this spring, PBO Yves Giroux said the initiative will give political parties more certainty and boost their credibility.  ""But the main advantage will be for Canadians. Canadians will have enhanced reassurance that there is a non-partisan and professional organization that provides cost estimates for political parties' engagements,"" he said.  'Pretty words'  The NDP criticized Trudeau's track record on seniors' issues, pointing to thousands of retirees whose pensions were cut due to a lack of protections after Sears Canada's bankruptcy, and those seniors now without dental care and prescription coverage.  ""At election time, Justin Trudeau gives us some pretty words but then gives tax breaks to the rich instead of doing the right thing for people. We'll protect pensions and take action on prescription drugs and dental care. That's what seniors deserve,"" said a statement from the NDP.  The Conservatives said Liberal policies have made life less affordable for seniors, citing the carbon tax and the cancellation of the transit tax credit. Scheer is promising to help seniors by introducing a universal tax cut, cancelling the carbon tax and removing the GST from home heating.  ""Justin Trudeau cannot be trusted to deliver for Canadian seniors. In 2015, Trudeau promised seniors he would create a seniors price index but he did nothing for four years and abandoned that plan. Now that he needs your vote, he's making even more promises that he won't keep,"" said a statement from the Conservative Party.",politics
147,"Champion of diversity or high-profile hypocrite? Who is Justin Trudeau, anyway?","There's probably nothing in the Canadian political strategy textbooks about how to pivot away from blackface.  Justin Trudeau and his campaign are trying, though, as they must. He addressed the photos and video that emerged this week at length Thursday afternoon. What was supposed to be a Liberal rally on Thursday night was turned into a town hall that permitted Trudeau to talk about his failings, but also some other issues. On Friday morning, Trudeau made a new campaign commitment to implement further restrictions on firearms.  The first questions from reporters after that announcement were about guns. But eventually the queries turned back to the offending images — 11 questions in total about blackface and its ramifications.  Those questions are likely to keep popping up for a while yet. But even if reporters and voters stop asking Trudeau about blackface — a natural consequence of reporters pursuing the story of the day — this episode will never really die.  Trudeau, more than any other politician, understands the power of an image. And this week's images might persist as reason to question who Trudeau is, or to frame a narrative about what kind of leader he really is.  A lifetime of contradictions  Perhaps more than any other recent Canadian politician, Trudeau has been surrounded by questions about who he is for his entire career — a consequence of his famous last name, his public stature and his lack of a track record in some serious-seeming pursuit like business or law.  Was he a callow young man or was he an inspiring leader? Was he just a pretty face or did he possess unique gifts? Was he not ready for high office or was he just the right sort of person for the job?    There are testimonies to who he was in his teens and 20s (when he apparently still thought that blackface was okay). But those accounts include contradictions.  In Magnetic North — a short biography authored by Alan Hustak in 2017 — one person describes Trudeau the high schooler as ""a bit of an attention seeker"" who ""knew the reaction he could provoke,"" but also someone who knew himself and was ""extremely sensitive to what was going on around him."" But Trudeau has said he could be shy and he has been described as a natural introvert.  Mary Margaret Jones, who ran the sexual assault centre at McGill University where Trudeau volunteered, has described the Trudeau she knew as ""really emotionally available"" and more able to discuss difficult issues like consent and rape culture than most young men his age.    Students at West Point Grey Academy in Vancouver told Hustak that they remembered Trudeau as ""energetic,"" ""slightly nerdy,"" ""eccentric"" and ""goofy."" Hustak relays a story of Trudeau accepting a student's dare to ride a skateboard down a steep slope. The future prime minister fell hard and ended up covered in mud.  ""We were all in stitches,"" the student told Hustak. ""What kind of a teacher would do that kind of thing?""  Perhaps the same kind of teacher who would show up to sell raffle tickets at a charity gala dressed as Aladdin with his face and arms and hands painted brown.    Justin Trudeau was ""emotionally available"" — and goofy. Pierre Trudeau was a showman and so was his son.  As a backbench MP and Liberal leader, Justin Trudeau was a mix of high-mindedness and stumbles. He swore at the environment minister. He made a silly comment about China. He made a very unfortunate joke about hockey and Vladimir Putin.  Principles and pratfalls  He also talked about changing the way politics is done and embracing diversity and tackling income inequality and combating climate change and pursuing reconciliation.  Either way, almost nothing that Trudeau does is done quietly.  His time in government has been a similar mix of ideals and pratfalls. Because of his office, the falls have landed harder.  His trip to the Aga Khan's island was used to undercut his stated commitment to the middle class. His trip to India revived the charge that he was insufficiently serious. The SNC-Lavalin affair undermined the claim that he was going to do things differently.  Those ideals, meanwhile, proved hard to live up to. Compared to the track Canada was on in 2015, emissions are now projected to decline by 200 megatonnes, pending further policies. But Trudeau also bought a pipeline (even if he was clear from the outset that he supported building a pipeline). Whatever the government has done to improve its relationship with Indigenous peoples, it also has surely disappointed them.  Trudeau has spoken of few issues with more passion than diversity and tolerance — perhaps overly so in some estimations. His government has enacted policies in line with that rhetoric (though one can debate whether it has moved fast enough or far enough). He has condemned white supremacy and directly challenged those who try to stoke fears about immigration — even confronting a heckler at an event in Quebec. Trudeau is likely the first prime minister to ever talk about privilege or intersectionality or unconscious bias.    ""It's time we recognize that anti-black racism and unconscious bias does exist,"" Trudeau said at a reception for Black History Month in 2018. ""It's time we hear — and believe — the stories of men and women who have been judged by the colour of their skin.""  That might've been a good moment to confess his own failings. Almost any moment would've been better for him than the current one.  Human beings are complicated and flawed. But political leaders have trouble claiming such allowances.    Having invoked a high standard, Trudeau is now charged with being a hypocrite. If you found Trudeau to be arrogant or haughty before now, you are no doubt appalled by the contradiction. Having been built up as the internet's ""boyfriend"" and an international darling, he is being taken down a peg (and because he is such a global figure, the story is getting wide notice).  He has walked himself out on a very long pier while forgetting to ensure that the planks behind him are sound.  Do those photos invalidate what he has stood for and said over the last four years? Do those images mean he shouldn't have been so strident? Or do they mean he just should have been upfront about his own failures, and sooner?  Will he be forgiven?  Trudeau will be pressed to explain how he became who he was in 2001, how he got from 2001 to 2019, and whether he ever thought about what he'd done. There are, as many have noted this week, broader issues to address coming out of this scandal. And Trudeau could put himself into that story.  Beyond the takes of columnists and pundits (the press pack has been known to misjudge the severity of controversies from time to time), voters will weigh and judge. Trudeau might be forgiven. What those images show is already turning out to be a matter of personal perspective. But the narrative will be up for debate.    Greg Lyle, an experienced pollster, wrote this week that much will depend on whether voters view the photos as an ""episodic"" failure or a ""thematic"" one — whether the photos are interpreted as a one-off lapse or part of a larger trend that speaks to who Trudeau is and how he has governed.    Even if dismissed now as lapses from Trudeau's past, the images will linger into the future as nagging memories, either to be brought up again at inconvenient moments or to be reinforced by future missteps or other excavated sins.  Trudeau can say that who he was in 2001 is not who he is now. But who he is was already a matter of debate — poked at by Conservatives who say he's ""not as advertised"" and an NDP leader who says Trudeau is more ""pretty words"" than real change.  Trudeau didn't win the last election on his own; his party's policy promises played a role as well. Those promises can now be measured against what the Liberal government has done. And the Liberals are putting forward new proposals now.  But the idea of Trudeau is more complicated now. As might've been clear before 2015, he has shown himself to be an imperfect carrier of heavy banners. But this week has directly challenged him to account for who he was supposed to be.  Trudeau was a public figure before he was a politician and he has always been a matter of some conjecture.  ""One of the first things I said when I won my nomination [in 2008] is, look, there's people out there who have incredibly high expectations, there are people out there who have incredibly low expectations,"" Trudeau told me in an interview earlier this year. ""I'm fairly certain I'm going to disappoint everybody by being somewhere in the middle between the stratosphere and the depths.""  By that measure, at least, he has lived up to expectations.",politics
218,"Fleabag wins big, Billy Porter makes history at Emmy Awards","Game of Thrones resurrected the Iron Throne at Sunday's Emmy ceremony, ruling as top drama on a night of surprises in which Pose star Billy Porter made history and the comedy series Fleabag led a British invasion that overturned expectations.  ""This all started in the demented mind of George R.R. Martin,"" said Game of Thrones producer David Benioff, thanking the author whose novels were the basis of HBO's fantasy saga.  Porter, who stars in the FX drama set in the LGBTQ ball scene of the late 20th century, became the first openly gay man to win a best drama series acting Emmy.  ""God bless you all. The category is love, you all, love. I'm so overjoyed and so overwhelmed to have lived to see this day,"" said an exuberant Porter, resplendent in a sparkling suit and swooping hat.  Amazon's Fleabag, a dark comedy about a dysfunctional woman, was honoured as best comedy and earned top acting honours for its British creator and star, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, and a best director trophy.  ""This is getting a ridiculous,"" Waller-Bridge said in her third trip to the stage to collect the top trophy.  Her acting win blocked Veep star Julia Louis-Dreyfus from setting a record as the most-honoured performer in Emmy history.  [PHOTOGALLERY]  ""Nooooo!"" a shocked-looking Waller-Bridge said as Louis-Dreyfus smiled for the cameras. ""Oh, my God, no. Thank you. I find acting really hard and really painful. But it's all about this,"" she said, her acting trophy firmly in hand.  In accepting the writing award earlier, she called the recognition proof that ""a dirty, pervy, messed-up woman can make it to the Emmys.""  Porter, a Tony and Grammy Award winning actor, relished his groundbreaking moment, quoting the late writer James Baldwin, Porter said it took him many years to believe he has the right to exist.  ""I have the right, you have the right, we all have the right,"" he said.    U.K. actress Jodie Comer was honoured as best drama actress for Killing Eve. She competed with Canadian co-star Sandra Oh, who received a Golden Globe for her role and would have been the first actress of Asian descent to win an Emmy in the category.  ""My mum and dad are in Liverpool [England] and I didn't invite them because I didn't think this was going to be my time. One, I'm sorry, two I love you,"" Comer said after saluting Oh.  Bill Hader won his second consecutive best comedy actor award for the hitman comedy Barry.  Peter Dinklage, named best supporting actor for Game of Thrones, set a record for most wins for the same role, four, breaking a tie with Aaron Paul of Breaking Bad.  ""I count myself so fortunate to be a member of a community that is about nothing but tolerance and diversity, because in no other place I could be standing on a stage like this,"" said Dinklage, a little person.    Ozark star Julia Garner won the best supporting drama actress trophy against a field including four actresses from Game of Thrones.  The auditorium erupted in cheers when Jharrel Jerome of When They See Us, about the Central Park Five case, won the best actor award for a limited series movie.  ""Most important, this is for the men that we know as the Exonerated Five,"" said Jerome, naming the five wrongly convicted men who were in the audience. They stood and saluted the actor as the crowd applauded them.  It was the only honour for the acclaimed Netflix series of the evening; Chernobyl won the best limited series honour.  Streaming hit new Emmy heights, powered by Amazon Prime winners Fleabag, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel and a Very English Scandal, and Netflix's Bandersnatch (Black Mirror), honoured as best movie. But HBO again showed its strength, including with the trophies for Chernobyl, Barry and John Oliver's best variety-talk win.  Calls to action  Michelle Williams, honoured as best actress for her portrayal of dancer Gwen Verdon in FX's limited series Fosseu002FVerdon, issued a call to arms for gender and ethnic equality.  She thanked the network and studio behind the project for ""supporting me completely and paying me equally because they understood ... when you put value into a person, it empowers that person to get in touch with their own inherent value. And where do they put that value, they put it into their work.""  ""And so the next time a woman and, especially a woman of colour, because she stands to make 52 cents on the dollar compared to her white male counterpart, tells you what she needs in order to do her job, listen to her,"" Williams said.    Patricia Arquette won the trophy best supporting limited-series or movie actress for The Act. She paid emotional tribute to her late trans sister, Alexis Arquette, and called for an end to prejudice against trans people, including in the workplace.  Ben Whishaw took the category's supporting actor trophy for A Very English Scandal, admitting in charming British fashion to a hangover.  Alex Borstein and Tony Shalhoub of The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel won best supporting acting awards at the ceremony, which included early and varied messages of female empowerment after the host-less ceremony kicked off with Homer Simpson.    ""I want to dedicate this to the strength of a woman, to [series creator] Amy Sherman-Palladino, to every woman on the Maisel cast and crew,"" Borstein said, and to her mother and grandmother. Her grandmother survived because she was courageous enough to step out of a line that, Borstein intimated, would have led to her death at the hands of Nazi Germany.  ""She stepped out of line. And for that, I am here and my children are here, so step out of line, ladies. Step out of line,"" said Borstein, who won the award last year.  Shalhoub added to his three Emmys which he earned for his signature series in Monk.  'Television has never been bigger'  The awards opened without a host as promised Sunday, with an early exchange pitting Ben Stiller against Bob Newhart.  ""I'm still alive,"" Newhart told Stiller, who introduced him as part of a wax museum comedy hall of fame that included Lucille Ball and other late legends.  Kim Kardashian West and Kendall Jenner drew some mocking laughter in the audience when they presented their award after Kardashian West said their family ""knows firsthand how truly compelling television comes from real people just being themselves.""    An animated Homer made a brief appearance on stage until he was abruptly crushed, with Anderson of Black-ish rushing in to, as he vowed, rescue the evening. He called Breaking Bad star Cranston on stage to tout the power of television from its beginning to the current golden age.  ""Television has never been bigger. Television has never mattered more. And television has never been this damn good,"" Cranston said.",entertainment
89,"Hidden asbestos: Hundreds of homes in Peterborough, Ont., suspected of containing toxic material from GE plant","When Ernie Farris walked past his childhood home in Peterborough, Ont., this summer for the first time in years, he had an alarming thought.  In the late 1940s, as a young teen, he had helped his father unload a truck full of fluffy, white scrap asbestos from the local General Electric factory, spreading it in the family's attic as cheap insulation.  No masks. No gloves.   The highly concentrated material known to cause cancer sat loose upstairs for decades.  ""My mom died [at age 45] with what they called asthma in 1954. I just wonder whether it was asthma, or if there was something related to the asbestos,"" said Farris. ""We took the bags up there … spread it around. Never knew any different about any hazards.""  A CBC Newsu002FToronto Star investigation has found that from the 1940s until the mid-1970s, General Electric sold off leftover asbestos scrap from its Peterborough factory for pennies a pound, delivering it by truck to potentially hundreds of workers' homes.    Over the years, thousands of the city's homes have changed hands. Many current owners are likely unaware of the history of General Electric asbestos being used as insulation — and the company hasn't stepped in to tell them.  GE doesn't acknowledge it ever sold what is now widely known to be cancer-causing material. But in recent years, the company has paid to clean up two dozen houses in Peterborough.  And neither the company nor local health officials have alerted the community that GE has a program that pays to remove the toxic waste hidden in walls and attics across the city.  GE denied sale of asbestos  In its heyday in the '60s and '70s, General Electric employed some 6,000 workers at its Peterborough factory. But after more than a century of building large machine engines at the site, the plant was shut down in late 2018.  It leaves behind a toxic legacy: PCBs buried on the 21-acre property are leaching into the soil and groundwater and hundreds of workers have won compensation for illnesses stemming from chemical exposures at the plant.   Now the company is grappling with highly concentrated asbestos — used as a fire retardant on metal wires and cables — that wound up in untold numbers of nearby homes.    ""Some employees in Peterborough may have taken home surplus asbestos,"" GE spokesperson Karissa Boley confirmed this spring. ""However GE has since abated much of that material and continues to work with the community when additional asbestos is found.""   The company has paid to clean up two dozen houses, she said.  Keith Riel, a Peterborough city councillor who used to lead the GE workers' union, believes the company is grossly underestimating the problem.  ""Hundreds of homes in Peterborough are insulated, up in their attics, with this loose asbestos,"" said Riel. ""If they've only done a couple of dozen, then that's just not even the tip of the iceberg.""  The contractor hired by GE to do the asbestos remediation said it believes the number of contaminated homes could be in the hundreds.  But in 2004, when the issue first surfaced publicly through a series of community meetings, GE flatly denied it ever sold off the waste.  ""We are unaware of any GE Canada practice allowing or condoning sales or allowing employees to take materials home,"" a company spokesperson told the Peterborough Examiner when the issue first surfaced.    GE's denials infuriated some workers, especially those whose job it was to bag the asbestos with their bare hands and load it onto delivery trucks.  ""I was so mad I was almost shaking,"" said Jim Dufresne, who spent 42 years with GE and was tasked with recycling the asbestos in the '60s and '70s.  ""Four or five of us would go up on the roof, open up the bin, and load it into garbage bags or refrigerator boxes and put it in the truck. You didn't have any protective equipment at all,"" he recalled.  ""They told us it was just 'plucking the goose' … because it's all white and it's like feathers.""  John Lewington also recalls the dozens of times he bagged up the scrap asbestos for resale through GE's salvage yard, where he says the company kept sales records.  ""If you bought salvage or asbestos — you bought any scrap — there was a record of it, whether it be steel, whether it was wood, whether it was asbestos,"" Lewington said. ""If it was delivered, if it was picked up at the gate, there's still a receipt.""    Dufresne has suffered two bouts of cancer that he suspects were work-related. He previously received workers' compensation for chronic lung problems as a result of asbestos exposure at the factory.   Back then, he says, no one he knew understood the risks.  But when GE publicly denied ever selling the hazardous material, Dufresne and some of his colleagues began looking for concrete proof. They scoured the local archives and found a 1956 advertisement in GE's own newspaper that appears to confirm workers had been using GE asbestos in their own homes ""for years.""  ""You can insulate for 3 cents a pound,"" the ad declares. ""Installed between the ceiling joists in uninsulated homes, asbestos fluff helps to hold heat in and cold out.""    ""They lied about it,"" said Dufresne. ""It's a carcinogen if it gets loose. They should be responsible for fixing everybody's house that they sold it to.""  While asbestos in homes is not hazardous if left undisturbed, residents could be at risk of exposure if they start renovations that break apart the fibrous material behind the walls or in the attic.   The federal government implemented a near-total ban of asbestos in Canada at the end of 2018.  'Secret' clean-up program  For the past 15 years, GE has hired environmental health specialists Pinchin Ltd. to oversee abatement of the toxic material, CBC and the Star have further learned.  The company says it has remediated 24 homes in all, three in the past year alone.  But at no point did local health officials or General Electric issue a public advisory to warn other residents of potential contamination from the asbestos. Nor did they advertise that GE has a program to remove the toxic material.  Rather it's been carried out quietly, the program's existence spreading by word of mouth.  ""[It's] like a best-kept secret,"" said Dr. Rosana Salvaterra, who has served as Peterborough's medical officer of health since 2008.  ""If the program still exists — and this was not something that I was aware of — it's definitely something we need to make people aware of.""    Back in 2004, her predecessor received calls from some concerned residents, which were passed on to GE. But Salvaterra said she had no clue about the company's ongoing clean-up effort, nor was she aware that hundreds of homes could remain contaminated  ""This is new information for me,"" Salvaterra said, when CBC and the Star presented her with evidence of decades' worth of GE asbestos sales.  ""It does beg the question, you know, how many homes are out there and where is the asbestos? Is it still there? And is it well-contained? Or is it actually putting people at risk?""  GE offers 1-800 line  In a statement, GE confirmed its clean-up program continues and that the company is willing to ""work with the community and homeowners if additional material is found.""    And for the first time, GE is publicly providing a 1-800 phone number for Peterborough residents who might ""believe their homes may have insulation with asbestos-containing material"" from the now-shuttered factory.     GE Canada Environmental Programs Information Line: 1-877-399-9599.    General Electric did not answer questions about what efforts have been made to track down employees who may have taken asbestos home. GE spokesperson Jeff Cay also declined to answer why the company has not used local media or done more community outreach to promote its clean-up efforts.     Read General Electric's full statement here.    ""They should be advertising it — not this secret kind of thing,"" said Riel.  The councillor also said he plans to formally ask health authorities to track down all of the city's contaminated homes.  ""We know that if one minute amount of [asbestos] gets into somebody's lungs it can cause asbestosis. So it's the right thing to do,"" he said. ""It's a health issue. If they have a program out there, then it should be known.""  High concentration of asbestos  Historically, asbestos was widely used in household building materials, until public awareness of its health hazards saw it slowly phased out.  The material from GE's Peterborough factory is unique for both its appearance and its high concentration of asbestos; it is made up of 70 per cent chrysotile asbestos — far higher than other commercial insulations that had only three to six per cent asbestos content.  A simple laboratory test can identify GE's product.    The cost of asbestos removal can be steep, ranging from $15,000 for a small attic cleanup to more than $250,000 for a major renovation.  According to Pinchin, specially trained crews must seal off houses, remove barriers, vacuum out the toxic material and then reinsulate and rebuild — all while monitoring air quality.  GE has paid to temporarily relocate affected homeowners in Peterborough, covering all meals and hotels.  Health worries remain  When the issue of GE asbestos first surfaced back in 2004, Ernie Farris was interviewed by the Peterborough Examiner and recounted how he and his father had spread the material in their house at 558 Douglas Ave.   Months later, the company knocked on the door of that house and surprised then-owner Larry Keeley by offering to clean it up.  ""I kinda had a good feeling about the company wanting to do that,"" Keeley recalled. ""GE's willing to pay for it, so I thought, easy for me to just pack a bag and go down to the Holiday Inn for a three-week vacation; all meals paid and a swimming pool and the whole works.""    Over a period of three weeks, GE sealed off the house and removed all traces of asbestos from the attic and walls.    Keeley then received a detailed report from GE's vice-president of environment, health and safety that stated: ""By completing this work, GE is not making any admissions of any kind.""    When told that Farris's mother died of asthma-like symptoms in the 1950s while living in the same house, Keeley revealed he himself had developed asthma while living there.  ""I'm wondering to what extent there might be a connection between the asbestos in the house and the fact that I developed asthma. I'm left with a question — hadn't even thought about it until now,"" he said.    General Electric operated dozens of factories across Canada and the United States over the years, though many having shut down or relocated in recent years. GE declined to answer whether it offers similar asbestos clean-up programs in other communities.   As a result of the CBCu002FStar investigation, Peterborough's medical officer of health says she plans this fall to investigate the matter further and advise citizens about GE's clean-up program.  ""We'll use our different communication channels to get that information out,"" said Salvaterra. ""If there are homes out there where there is asbestos that needs to be remediated, those homeowners will get the assistance they need to do that.""

126,'This is a massive deal for me:' Taika Waititi's Jojo Rabbit wins TIFF's People's Choice Award,"Jojo Rabbit, Taika Waititi's Nazi Germany-set ""anti-hate satire,"" has captured the Toronto International Film Festival's coveted People's Choice Award.  The film centres on a young German boy (Roman Griffin Davis) who dreams of being a good Nazi, aided by his imaginary friend Adolf Hitler (portrayed by New Zealand filmmaker Waititi).  His world is turned upside down when he discovers a teenaged Jewish girl (Thomasin McKenzie) being hidden in his home by his mother (Scarlett Johansson). The movie is loosely based on the novel Caging Skies by Christine Leunens.  ""It's a huge honour and this is a massive deal for me,"" Waititi said in a video posted by TIFF organizers Sunday.   ""The outpouring of love and emotion and support for the film from the audiences was just the first time I'd experienced that and it's going to stay with me forever. And now this award, it's incredible.""     During the festival, Waititi defended his film against those critical of its whimsical feel and irreverent take on the waning days of the Nazi regime.   ""I think, more than ever, it's vital that we [remind] people of what happened [during the Second World War],"" he told CBC News.     ""If that involves having to bring in fantasy characters and using magic realism and using different techniques and sometimes comedy, so be it. We have to keep telling these stories.""    The People's Choice Prize is the second honour Indigenous writer-director and performer Waititi received at the festival this year.  Known for his superhero blockbuster Thor: Ragnarok, cult vampire comedy What We Do in the Shadows, as well as acclaimed New Zealand films Boy and Hunt for the Wilderpeople, he was also the recipient of the TIFF Ebert Director Award at the festival's inaugural TIFF Tribute Awards fundraising gala.    Runners-up for the top TIFF prize included Marriage Story, Noah Baumbach's modern portrait of a disintegrating relationship, and Parasite, Bong Joon-ho's upstairs-downstairs thriller that captured the Palme d'Or in Cannes.    TIFF is widely considered the unofficial start to the movie awards season, with films that win the festival's main People's Choice Award often going on to receive further kudos and acclaim. Past TIFF winners have included movies such as Green Room, La La Land, Room, 12 Years a Slave, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri and Slumdog Millionaire, all of which subsequently went on to major recognition at the Oscars.   Other winners announced Sunday include:      People's Choice Documentary Award: The Cave, a portrait of a doctor operating a subterranean Syrian hospital, directed by Feras Fayyad.   People's Choice Midnight Madness Award: dystopian prison horror film The Platform, directed by Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia.   Best Canadian First Feature Film ($15,000): The Twentieth Century, a surreal re-imagining of William Lyon Mackenzie King's formative years, directed by Matthew Rankin.   Best Canadian Feature Film ($30,000): modern-day adaptation Antigone directed by Sophie Deraspe.   Short Cuts Award for Best Canadian Short Film ($10,000): Delphine, centred on a Lebanese-Canadian teen girl, directed by Chloé Robichaud.    Short Cuts Award for Best Short Film ($10,000): tender feline tale All Cats Are Grey in the Dark, directed by Lasse Linder.   NETPAC Award: Lebanon-set school drama 1982, directed by Oualid Mouaness.     This year, TIFF's leadership chose to change the way it presents its final awards and dispensed with its traditional final-day gathering to unveil prize-winners.  Instead, organizers split up the various honours (the first batch emerged on Thursday) and revealed the recipients via press release and social media, including posting video reactions from most of the winning filmmakers on Sunday.  Previously announced winners include:     Toronto Platform Prize ($20,000): Martin Eden, directed by Pietro Marcello.   International Critics' Prize (FIPRESCI), Discovery Program: Murmur, directed by Heather Young.   International Critics' Prize (FIPRESCI), Special Presentations Program: How to Build a Girl, directed by Coky Giedroyc.    TIFF has scheduled free screenings of some of this year's winning films — including the recipients of the People's Choice Award, the People's Choice Documentary Award, the People's Choice Midnight Madness Award and the Toronto Platform Prize — at TIFF Bell Lightbox in downtown Toronto on Sunday afternoon.  Organizers also announced that the 45th edition of the Toronto International Film Festival will be held Sept.10-20, 2020.",entertainment
34,"Best Buy, Staples accused of 'urging' customers to pirate TV shows with devices sold in stores","Premium TV network Super Channel has filed a lawsuit against four Canadian retailers for allegedly selling ""pirate devices"" and educating customers how to use them to watch TV without paying for it.   In a court document filed in Federal Court this week, Super Channel accuses Best Buy, Staples, Canada Computers and London Drugs of copyright infringement, claiming their employees are ""urging"" customers to pirate online content using streaming devices that are sold in store.   The four retailers ""are advertently contributing to the creation of a culture of widespread infringement and theft,"" Super Channel alleges in the document. ""Their actions are high-handed and unfair to their customers and causing damage to the plaintiff.""  Also listed as defendants in the lawsuit are customers who bought the ""pirate devices"" and received accompanying advice in store. They're currently listed as ""John Doe customers"" because Super Channel doesn't have their names, although it plans to pursue this information.   The network wouldn't name each of the ""pirate devices"" involved, but said that the case includes Android boxes, which have become the scourge of the cable industry. When special software is added and the boxes are connected to TVs, they can be used to stream unauthorized content — including movies and TV shows that Super Channel owns the rights to in Canada.  Customers only pay a one-time fee for the box, usually around $60 to $200.  Caught on camera  As part of its case, Super Channel claims to have more than 100 hours of undercover video gathered by private investigators who visited multiple Best Buy, Staples, Canada Computers and London Drugs locations, posing as customers curious about pirating content.   Super Channel provided CBC News with a segment of the video. It includes audio allegedly from employees from each of the four retailers, who offer advice about in-store devices that can be set up to stream shows without paying for them.   ""This gets you free content, like free TV and movies,"" someone said in one audio clip from the video.  ""You don't have to pay for anything else when you pay for this,"" said another.    Super Channel CEO Don McDonald said he was ""shocked"" when he viewed the footage. The video captures more than 150 incidents supporting Super Channel's case, he said, and that the employees involved in promoting these devices range from floor staff to higher-ups.   ""Managers that are not kids — they're in their 30s and 40s, telling people how to do it,"" McDonald said. ""It is rampant.""  Why would store staff assist customers? In the court document, Super Channel alleges the motive is ""to encourage and increase the sales of the pirate devices.""    Best Buy, Staples, Canada Computers and London Drugs — which each received copies of the lawsuit this week — told CBC News that they deny the allegations and follow Canadian copyright laws.   ""[We] believe that the claims are entirely without merit,"" a Best Buy spokesperson said in an email. ""We respect and value intellectual property, and believe content providers and artists should be fairly compensated for their work.""  McDonald said that Super Channel showed the video to the four retailers in the spring, but that failed to put a stop to the problem. ""I wanted them to be step up and be a champion in changing the culture,"" he said. ""They didn't see the light.""    CBC News asked each retailer about their meeting with Super Channel. Only London Drugs responded, stating that the network refused to disclose which products it took issue with.  ""Nevertheless, we took the opportunity to remind our employees of the importance of Canadian copyright compliance and adherence to our code of conduct,"" London Drugs spokesperson Wendy Hartley said in an email.   War on piracy  Super Channel is seeking damages for loss of business due to the retailers' customers pirating its content. It also wants a permanent injunction to prevent Best Buy, Staples, Canada Computers and London Drugs from selling and promoting ""pirate devices.""  ""We want the stores to stop. We want the stores to say, 'Hey this is wrong,'"" said McDonald.     The lawsuit is just the latest attempt to curb piracy in Canada. In 2016, Bell, Rogers and Videotron launched a legal battle in Federal Court, targeting smaller dealers who sell Android boxes pre-loaded with software used to pirate content.   The case is ongoing and the list of defendants has ballooned from five in 2016 to more than 130 today.  Last year, Bell and Rogers also joined a coalition of more than 30 members, including CBC and Super Channel, which proposed blocking Canadians from websites offering pirated content. However, the plan was rejected by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, which said it didn't have jurisdiction to enforce it.    Critics have argued it's impossible to stamp out technology that enables piracy, so the best solution is to offer affordable and easily accessible programming.  McDonald estimates Super Channel loses about $12 million a year from subscribers who turn to piracy. He said he hopes the lawsuit will help change the culture of piracy by sending a message that it's not acceptable   ""This affects our business and it's the wrong thing to do,"" he said. ""If we can even start to make a dent in this from an awareness point of view, then we are on the right track.""",technology

178,WHO says Tanzania not sharing details on Ebola-like cases,"The World Health Organization has issued an unusual statement raising questions about whether Tanzania is covering up possible cases of the deadly Ebola virus, a significant cause for concern during a regional outbreak that has been declared a rare global health emergency.  The statement on Saturday said Tanzania's government ""despite several requests"" is refusing to share the results of its investigations into a number of patients with Ebola-like symptoms and is refusing to ship patient samples to an outside WHO partner lab.  Tanzania's government, which has said it has no Ebola cases, could not immediately be reached for comment Sunday. The cases would be the first-ever Ebola infections confirmed in the East African country.  The United Nations health agency says it was made aware on Sept. 10 of the death in Tanzania's commercial capital, Dar es Salaam, of a 27-year-old patient suspected to have Ebola. A day later, it received unofficial reports that an Ebola test had come back positive. On Thursday, it received unofficial reports that a contact of the patient, who had travelled widely in the country, was sick and hospitalized.  A rapid response is crucial in containing Ebola, which can be fatal in up to 90 per cent of cases and is most often spread by close contact with bodily fluids of people exhibiting symptoms or with contaminated objects.  Assessing risk difficult  The WHO statement said the lack of information from Tanzania made it difficult to assess potential risks.  The Ebola outbreak based in neighbouring Congo has infected over 3,000 people and killed nearly 2,000 of them. A few cases have been confirmed in neighbouring Uganda as well, and other neighbouring countries have been preparing for the outbreak's possible spread.    This is not the first time health officials have raised serious questions about the suspected Tanzania cases. On Monday, the U.S. health and human services secretary, Alex Azar, told reporters in Uganda that he and others were ""very concerned about the lack of transparency"" in Tanzania.  Critics have shown increasing alarm as Tanzanian President John Magufuli's government has restricted access to key information and cracked down on perceived dissent. Lawmakers recently approved an amendment to a statistics law to make it a crime to distribute information not sanctioned by the government or which contradicts the government.  The World Bank was among those expressing concern at that amendment.",health
221,Advocates hope Queer Eye star's HIV-positive disclosure helps break stigma,"Advocates at a Winnipeg fundraiser in support of HIV awareness and funding are hoping the recent revelation made by Queer Eye star Jonathan Van Ness about being HIV-positive will help break the stigma around and educate people about those living with the diagnosis.  Van Ness told The New York Times in an article published Saturday that, when he was 25, he fainted while working at a salon and went to Planned Parenthood to diagnosis his flu-like symptoms. There, he tested positive for HIV.   ""That day was just as devastating as you would think it would be,"" Van Ness, the grooming expert on the Netflix makeover show, wrote in his memoir Over the Top, which is set to be released on Tuesday and was quoted by the Times.  The now 32-year-old says he hopes his disclosure will help break the stigma around HIV, and that others will come out and join him as a ""member of the beautiful HIV-positive community.""  Barb Burkowski, an organizer of Sunday's Red Ribbon Walk &amp; Run in Winnipeg, an event that aims to fight against HIV stigma and to raise money for programs and services for those living with HIV, says Van Ness coming out as HIV-positive can help those who aren't out.   ""We have people who have HIV and have a self-stigma where they don't want to come out,"" Burkowski told CBC News.    ""If we have people that come out on a bigger level, it's more likely that people will feel a little bit better.""  Christine Bibeau, who has been living with HIV for 10 years, was a participant at Sunday's event.  ""For a long time, I was a closet HIV-positive person,"" she told CBC News.  ""One of the things I really remember was somebody close in my family, when I first had told them I was HIV-positive, right away phoned up somebody else because I had been at their baby shower and I held their baby. That kind of still sticks with me, 10 years later.""    Bibeau hopes to combat disinformation about HIV — Public Health Agency of Canada says HIV can't be spread by ""casual contact"" — noting she now has three children, all born after learning she was positive and all of whom are HIV-negative. She also said revelations like those made by Van Ness go a long way to helping.  ""I would like to see more people being OK about being open about [being HIV-positive], because I think that comes into education,"" she said.  Kyle Voth, who also participated in the event to support the cause, agrees.  ""I think it's a really brave thing to do,"" he told CBC News.    ""It's giving young people and both queer and straight people a really positive voice in [the HIV-positive] community about it. It's really great.""  Brent Young, who participated in Sunday's event in drag, said he was diagnosed and came out as positive during the AIDS era. He notes being positive is no longer the death sentence it once was and also applauds Van Ness for coming out.  ""He has the platform where he can actively crusade,"" he said.    ""It's also positive that other people can see this in the rest of the world, and say, 'Hey, somebody else has this too. I don't have to be alone any more.""  As of 2016, there were more than 63,000 Canadians living with HIV, according to estimates released by the Public Health Agency of Canada last year.  Of those, an estimated 14 per cent were unaware or undiagnosed.   It also says people taking appropriate amounts of antiretroviral treatment ""pose effectively no risk of transmitting HIV infection to their sexual partner.""",entertainment

138,Scheer promises to clear veterans benefits backlog if elected,"Andrew Scheer made a slew of promises to veterans on Sunday morning, including pledging that a Conservative government would deal with the backlog of veterans benefits applications within two years.   The Conservatives are proposing to create a military covenant between the federal government and all veterans — a legislative pledge to ensure veterans are respected and provided with services in a timely manner.   ""Our military heroes are deserving. Our military heroes are worth it,"" he said, addressing a crowd of veterans sitting on a cliff above the ocean in Canoe Cove, P.E.I.  Scheer didn't say what that would mean in practical terms, but said it's about changing the ""culture"" around veterans.    The Parliamentary Budget Office estimates the promise to clear the application backlog would cost $51 million over two years.   That backlog has been a problem for the federal government for years.  Most waiting 4 months or more  The Liberals have been struggling to work through the stack of benefits applications. As of last December, Veterans Affairs had 27,107 disability claims registered in the system. Of those, 15,421 — 57 per cent of the total — had been waiting in the queue for more than four months.  Trudeau's government hired more frontline staff and committed $42 million over two years to clear up the backlog. But the system has been plagued with issues, including an accounting error that short-changed 270,000 ex-soldiers on their benefits.  ""Talk is cheap,"" Scheer said of his opponent. ""You have been betrayed. You deserve better.""     On top of dealing with the backlog, the Conservatives say they will create a pension system that is more fair to disabled former military members.   The Parliamentary Budget Office released its analysis of the Conservatives' proposal to increase pension payments, estimating the cost in the 2020-2021 fiscal year (the first year it's in place) at $103 million. It would drop in half to $51 million the following year and flatline around that mark up to 2029.  During the 2015 election campaign, the Liberals promised to give injured military members the option of receiving either a lifetime pension or a lump sum disability award.  Liberal reworking of pensions poorly received  The previous pension system was proposed by the Martin Liberals in 2005 and enacted by the Harper government in 2006, with injured veterans offered a lump sum payment most considered inadequate.  The new Liberal plan, which involved a complex redrawing of the benefits system, was unveiled in December 2017 and implemented this year.    A PBO report from earlier this year found that new system of benefits for injured veterans is slightly more generous than the one it replaces, but leaves the most severely disabled in worse financial shape.  The dearth of services for veterans dates back to the Harper years with the shutting of eight Veterans Affairs offices.   ""We have a new opportunity,"" Scheer said of the Harper cuts, reaffirming he has a ""personal interest in ensuring that the commitments we've made today are followed through on.""   Commemorations, service dogs, mefloquine inquiry  The Conservatives would also beef up transition services for discharged and retiring Forces members, provide more service dogs, kick-start more commemoration projects and launch an independent inquiry to investigate the cases of members who were given mefloquine.   Several Forces members have launched a lawsuit against the government because of traumatic side effects from the anti-malaria drug.  They allege they are still suffering from psychosis, paranoia and insomnia.  That investigation would cost $20 million over two years, according to the PBO. Service dog costs are pegged at $4.5 million over three years.",politics
94,"Many women say 1st sexual experience was forced in teens, U.S. study says","The first sexual experience for 1 in 16 U.S. women was forced or coerced intercourse in their early teens, encounters that for some may have had lasting health repercussions, a study suggests.  The experiences amount to rape, the authors say, although they relied on a national survey that didn't use the word in asking women about forced sex.  Almost 7 per cent of women surveyed said their first sexual intercourse experience was involuntary; it happened at age 15 on average and the man was often several years older.  Almost half of those women who said intercourse was involuntary said they were held down and slightly more than half of them said they were verbally pressured to have sex against their will.    ""Any sexual encounter [with penetration] that occurs against somebody's will is rape. If somebody is verbally pressured into having sex, it's just as much rape,"" said lead author Dr. Laura Hawks, an internist and Harvard Medical School researcher.  In the years after coerced or forced sex, affected women had more sex partners, unwanted pregnancies and abortions, and more reproductive health problems including pelvic pain and menstrual irregularities than women whose first sexual experience wasn't forced. Almost 16 per cent reported fair or poor health, double the rate of other women. The study couldn't establish whether forced sex caused or contributed to any of the health or other problems.  ""Experiencing rape at first sexual encounter is an extreme loss of autonomy over one's sexuality,"" Hawks said. She said it's not surprising that it might lead to later mental and physical health problems, given other studies on lasting effects of trauma.  The results were published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine.  Poorer psychological well-being  Other studies have found that long-term effects of sexual assault may include social isolation, feelings of powerlessness, stigmatization, poor self-image and risky behaviour, which all may increase risks for depression and other mental health problems, a journal editorial said.  Research published last year also found worse psychological well-being and physical health among women whose first intercourse was forced or coerced.  The new study is an analysis of responses from 13,310 adult women who participated in nationally representative U.S. government health surveys from 2011-2017, before the emergence of the ""Me, Too"" movement.  The researchers focused on a survey question that asked during in-person interviews if women's first vaginal intercourse experience with a man ""was voluntary or not voluntary, that is, did you did you choose to have sex of your own free will or not?""    The results suggest that for 1 in 16 American women — or 3 million — the first sexual encounter was not voluntary.  According to the federal U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 1 in 5 women have been raped in their lifetimes. For almost half of those women, it happened when they were younger than 18.  The study, which asked women from ages 18-44 to recall their first sexual experience, has no information on women's relationship with the men, who could have been boyfriends, relatives or strangers. Men were not included in the study.  Inadequate sex education  Hawks said boys need to be taught communication skills to prevent them from pursuing sex ""with someone who is an unwilling participant."" The onus should not be on the victims, she said.  ""The 'Me, Too' movement is a promising sign that we're more willing as a society"" to address sexual violence she said.  The journal editorial notes that the study lacks information on women's health and any abuse before their first sexual encounter. There also is no data on any later sexual violence — which all might contribute to health problems, the editorial said.  ""Such research is needed to understand and address the full range and consequences of these experiences,"" the editorial said.  Sex education specialist Dan Rice said inadequate sex education in U.S. schools contributes to the problem.  ""Our culture teaches people not to be raped instead of teaching people not to rape,"" he said.  Close calls  Consent isn't always on the agenda and boys often aren't taught how to express their emotions in healthy ways, said Rice, interim executive director at Answer, a Rutgers University group that provides sex education training for teachers and oversees Sex, Etc., a teen-run sex education magazine and website.  Sarah Emily Baum, 19, a staff writer for Sex, Etc., said the study results ring true.  ""Almost everyone has a story or a close call like this one or knows someone with a story or close call,"" said Baum, a sophomore at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York.  Baum recalls that a police officer invited to discuss sexual consent and assault at her high school focused only on girls, telling them, ""'You've got to make sure you say no and say it loud enough for people to hear.""' There was little mention of boys' responsibility, and no discussion of same-sex assaults or even girls being the aggressors, said Baum, who is gay.  ""If I go on a date with another girl, I also have to make sure there is clear consent and clear boundaries,"" she said. ""It goes both ways.""",health
225,New Leonard Cohen album of previously unreleased songs coming November,"A new posthumous album of previously unreleased Leonard Cohen music was announced by Sony Music on Friday.  Entitled Thanks for the Dance, the album will be released on Nov. 22.  The iconic Canadian singer, songwriter and poet from Montreal died in Los Angeles on Nov. 7, 2016, at age 82.  Sony Music said in a written statement the album is a collection of never-heard-before music sketched out while Cohen and his son, Adam Cohen, were working on their collaboration You Want it Darker. The elder artist had asked his son to bring these works to completion.  The album was made in several locations with contributions from numerous other artists, many of them former Cohen collaborators.  Javier Mas, acclaimed player of the Spanish laúd, a stringed instrument, who accompanied Cohen on stage for his last eight years of touring, flew to Los Angeles from Barcelona to capture the late artist's spirit using Cohen's own guitar.  At a music festival in Berlin, Adam Cohen invited friends to lend their talents. Damien Rice and Leslie Feist contributed vocal tracks, while Richard Reed Parry of Arcade Fire played bass.  In Los Angeles, Jennifer Warnes, a close friend and collaborator of Cohen's known in part for her own soulful interpretations of some of his songs, sang background vocals.  ""In composing and arranging the music for his words, we chose his most characteristic musical signatures, in this way keeping him with us,"" Adam Cohen said in the Sony statement. ""What moves me most about the album is the startled response of those who have heard it. 'Leonard lives!' they say, one after the other.""  The first song from the album premiered on CBC Radio's q with Tom Power on Friday.    The announcement comes on the same day Canada Post is set to honour Cohen with a new set of stamps.   The three-stamp set will be unveiled at an event at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts this afternoon.  Canada Post says it will produce four million stamps, a number it believes will be sufficient for fans and collectors worldwide.    The stamps will be available to the public as of Saturday — which would have been Cohen's 85th birthday — with Canada Post hosting a special event at a downtown Montreal post office.  The design of the stamps has been a closely-guarded secret ahead of Friday's event, which will take place in the shadow a massive Cohen mural on Crescent Street that has become a mainstay of the Montreal landscape.",entertainment
184,The science behind why vaping is becoming so popular in Canada,"Vaping is quickly becoming a lot more popular with Canadians, despite what little is known of its long-term health effects.  Experts say part of the reason for the surge in use in such a short time is the evolution of the devices themselves.  ""We used to say that cigarettes are the most effective way of consuming nicotine, but e-cigarettes have replaced them,"" said Dr. Robert Schwartz, a senior scientist at Toronto's Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH).  ""They're so small and discreet and these new devices don't create the huge clouds that the previous devices did — people can use them anywhere, all the time.""  Newer devices such as Juul or Vype, which came to the Canadian market last fall, mimic the physical feeling of a cigarette on the throat and use what are known as ""nicotine salts"" to deliver higher concentrations of the drug to the brain — much in the same way that cigarettes do.   ""It used to be that if the nicotine concentration was too high, it would give you a harsh or aversive feeling on your throat,"" says David Hammond, a public health professor at the University of Waterloo who researches vaping in youth.   ""Juul solved that. That's why Juul is somewhere around half the market. That's why most of the other major brands in Canada, including Vype and the smaller ones, have switched to nicotine salts.""    E-cigarettes themselves aren't new, having been first introduced in Canada in 2004, according to the Heart and Stroke Foundation, but the chemistry behind the devices has changed dramatically in the past two years with new players on the market.   Schwartz says before the use of nicotine salts in products like Juul, the highest nicotine concentrations commercially sold in Canada were typically upward of 20 milligrams per millilitre, which is the regulated limit in the European Union.   The maximum amount of nicotine content allowed in e-cigarettes in Canada is currently 66 milligrams per millilitre, according to Health Canada. The Canadian Cancer Society says the highest amount used in Juul products is 59, and 57 in Vype.  Juul says one of its cartridges, or pods, has roughly the same amount of nicotine as a pack of 20 cigarettes.    ""Once they solved the chemistry of palatable nicotine delivery, then all those others factors that were responsible for vaping becoming popular,"" Hammond says.   ""You throw in tasty flavours and boom you have a wonderful little drug delivery device that sits in your pocket.""   Smoking alternative  Eva Egnatieva, 16, started using an e-cigarette two months ago and admits she doesn't know exactly why.   ""My friends, they're older than me and they're all smoking this,"" the Toronto high school student said while inhaling a Juul e-cigarette between classes.   ""I think when I'm nervous or I have some problem, I smoke it and I'm relaxed, not worried.""     Egnatieva says that while she's never smoked a cigarette, she started using an e-cigarette without nicotine at the age of 15. She says the first time she tried an e-cigarette with nicotine in it she hated it, but stuck with it.   ""I only smoke Juul,"" she says. ""I don't like to smoke cigarettes because I hate the smell of cigarettes.""   Egnatieva says she has little knowledge of the long-term health effects of using the device, but it doesn't discourage her from using it and has no plans to quit.    Leo Ting, a 38-year-old University of Toronto faculty member, says he transitioned to using an e-cigarette to quit smoking three years ago.  ""I've gotten to the point to where I touch a cigarette and I do not want to have another one,"" he says.  ""Which is not something that was the case when I was trying to cold turkey it before, so this has helped in that case.""  He says he hopes to stop vaping completely in about a year, in order to lower the chances of having a relapse, and has been gradually lowering the amount of nicotine he consumes in the device.   Surge in popularity   Hammond says the growing popularity of e-cigarettes in Canada is in part because of their use as a tool to quit smoking, but also because of their attractiveness to young people.   ""Juul has both made them more likely to help smokers quit, it's also made them more likely to bring new non-smoking youth into the market,"" he says.  ""We need to make them available to adult smokers; we still have five million Canadians that smoke, but we've done a poor job at framing these products as something you use to quit smoking, rather than something you take to a party on Friday night when you're 17.""    Hammond led a study published in the British Medical Journal last June, based on online surveys of Canadians aged 16 to 19 in 2017 and 2018, which found that the number of Canadian teens who said they had vaped in the last month had grown 74 per cent, from 8.4 per cent in 2017 to 14.6 per cent in 2018.  New data from the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse show a significant increase in teenagers in grades eight, 10 and 12 who say they have used an e-cigarette since 2018. One in 11 U.S. students in Grade 8 reported they had vaped in the past month in 2019, one in five in Grade 10 and one in four in Grade 12.    ""What we're seeing now is rapidly increasing rates of e-cigarette use in teens and young adults,"" says Dr. Nicholas Chadi, a pediatrician at CHU Sainte-Justine in Montreal and addiction medicine specialist.   ""They've been very aggressively marketed in all sorts of forms — social media and big billboard ads — to target young people, even though companies will say the contrary. The marketing strategy has worked very well.""   Health concerns   On Wednesday, health officials in London, Ont., announced what's believed to be the first case in Canada of a respiratory illness linked to vaping. The high-school-age individual used e-cigarettes daily, was initially on life-support, and is now recovering at home.   While it's not yet known what was in the cartridge, Health Canada says it's concerned by reports of severe pulmonary illness as well as the increase in vaping reported among Canadian youth and it's considering ""additional measures"" regarding the role of flavours, nicotine concentration and product design, and how all of that contributes to vaping's appeal to youth and non-smokers.    Toronto Public Health reported Thursday they had also encountered a small number of patients in recent weeks who potentially had a vaping-related illness.   The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 530 confirmed and probable cases of lung injury related to e-cigarettes as of Sept. 17, including at least seven deaths.     ""This remains a relatively new phenomenon in our country so we're still wrestling to understand the long-term health effects, but certainly the short-term are incredibly concerning,"" says Terry Dean, president and CEO of the Canadian Lung Association. ""We certainly cannot view them as harmless, because they're not.""   Dean says appropriate regulation, policy and education led to the curbing of tobacco consumption rates in Canada and he believes a similar approach should be taken as soon as possible with e-cigarettes and in particular where they're accessible for youth.   ""If you're not vaping today — don't start. Blanket statement,"" he said. ""If you are vaping to help stop smoking, your end goal should be to stop vaping.""    Chadi says there has never been such a ""rapid uptake"" in the history of recorded substance use in teens, many of whom may not know how addictive they are and how much nicotine they contain.  ""There is some research that shows for young people ages 25 and under with a brain that's still changing, these devices are not an effective smoking cessation tool because you can get very hooked up to the nicotine that comes with it,"" he says.  ""Doctors, pediatricians, but also dentists, social workers and school nurses need to ask the right questions to teens to know if they're using them, what they think about them and try to help.""",health
179,What Purdue Pharma's bankruptcy filing means for Canada,"This is an excerpt from Second Opinion, a weekly roundup of eclectic and under-the-radar health and medical science news emailed to subscribers every Saturday morning. If you haven't subscribed yet, you can do that by clicking here.    Purdue Pharma filed for bankruptcy in the U.S. this week to protect itself and its owners from more than 2,000 lawsuits over their role in the ongoing opioid crisis, but the move has put pressure on Canadian efforts to bring the company to face legal action here.  The company, which is owned by members of the Sackler family, made billions selling the prescription painkiller OxyContin that is widely seen as a catalyst to the crisis that claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. It filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy Sunday and proposed a settlement in the U.S. worth up to $12 billion US.  At the centre of the lawsuits is the allegation that the company marketed and promoted prescription opioids as less addictive than was actually known, while misleading both those prescribing the medications and the patients themselves about the risks.   Future of Canadian lawsuits  Last year, the B.C. government launched a similar class-action lawsuit against Purdue Pharma and more than 40 other companies on behalf of all provincial, territorial and federal governments over the marketing of opioids in Canada. The suit aims to recover the health care costs of the crisis.   The concern in Canada is that because of the U.S. bankruptcy filing, the assets at the centre of the lawsuit could be in jeopardy, says Matthew Herder, director of the Health Law Institute at Dalhousie University in Halifax.    ""There's a bit of a race underway to secure what wealth remains in that company because that is ultimately the source of the money that might be paid,"" he said.  ""There have been reports of the Sackler family having transferred wealth to various offshore locations, so there are growing questions around what the financial state of play is for that company and its affiliates like the Canadian ones.""   Reidar Mogerman, lead counsel for the lawsuit in B.C., says the provinces are looking for ""fair resolution"" that can address the ongoing opioid crisis.     ""The total cost, if I win my case, is bigger than Purdue can pay. They have set loose an epidemic that is larger than they can pay for,"" Mogerman said.  ""The provinces are realistic about what they will recover. They're not necessarily going to recover every dollar they've spent, but they are going to recover enough money to help fix the crisis, and they're going to recover from the people they say were responsible for the crisis.""  The bankruptcy filing also speaks to the lack of federal regulation Purdue Pharma has faced in Canada over its marketing of OxyContin, says Dr. Nav Persaud, a family doctor at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto.     ""It shows how Purdue Pharma and other opioid manufacturers have been given free rein in Canada,"" he said.   A key point of contention in the lawsuit is the claim from Purdue Pharma Canada that it is a ""separate company"" from Purdue Pharma in the U.S. and the actions taken to settle litigation there don't ""directly affect"" its business in Canada.    ""Purdue Canada is being a bit cute in saying that they are a separate entity for the purpose of the bankruptcy because they are a wholly owned asset of the bankrupt company,"" Mogerman said.   ""Eventually, that bankruptcy will swallow Purdue Canada.""   Misleading marketing allegations  The Canadian lawsuit rests on the same principles alleging misleading advertising and understating the addictive qualities of opioids, but there are differences in the legal systems that make prosecuting the companies challenging — including the speed in which the courts move.   ""It has taken them I think 20 years, but the tobacco companies in Canada are now bankrupt and facing the recovery actions brought by the provinces. It has just taken a long time to get there,"" Mogerman said.     ""Eventually, the result will be the same. If they did something bad they're going to have to pay in Canada, just like they will in the U.S.""   Purdue Pharma Canada said in a statement that it followed all of Health Canada's regulations, including those governing marketing, and it's ""deeply concerned"" about the opioid crisis in B.C. and across Canada.    But Persaud says there is ""documented evidence"" that Purdue Pharma Canada alleged in medical journals that long-acting opioids such as OxyContin had a lower abuse potential than earlier opioids.   Sacklers under fire  Ahead of the bankruptcy filing this summer, the Canadian class action also applied to add individual members of the Sackler family to the lawsuit, as well as other ""senior decision makers"" at Purdue Pharma Canada.     ""We are comfortable, based on the things that we've alleged, that those individuals are also liable for the healthcare costs that the government entities paid in relation to opioids,"" Mogerman said.   ""They're not the company but they have their own potential individual liability and they don't want to be chased to the ends of the earth for their share.""    Herder says the decision to apply to add the Sacklers to the Canadian lawsuit is the ""right move"" but doesn't necessarily mean it will be successful in establishing liability.   ""I don't think that's the end of the story as to whether the Sacklers will ever pay a dime of their own personal finances.""

101,Asteroid breakup 466 million years ago may have triggered ice age,"Roughly 466 million years ago, an asteroid broke apart almost half a billion kilometres from Earth. And according to a new study published in Science Advances on Wednesday, that event may have played a vital role in shaping life on our planet.  Using previous studies on paleoclimate (the study of ancient climate), biodiversity and existing studies on the breakup of this 150-kilometre rock in the asteroid belt, a team of scientists suggests that the Mid-Ordovician ice age was greatly affected by dust from the asteroid that made its way to Earth.  They hypothesize that over a span of two million years, dust enveloped Earth, shrouding it from sunlight, which in turn caused a cooling effect that intensified the ice age and lowered sea levels.  Not all of this was bad, however. They also theorize that it subsequently led to a burst of marine biodiversity.      Earth is constantly being bombarded by dust and meteorites — including some that are very small, called micrometeorites. It's estimated that roughly 100 tonnes of space dust falls to Earth daily, including some from this asteroid that broke-up half a billion years ago.  But while this dust goes pretty much unnoticed today, 466 million years ago, roughly 10,000 times more dust was falling on Earth.  And this, the researchers believe, was vital in reshaping Earth.  ""People always think of the global killer, but it can be the opposite,"" said Philipp Heck, co-author of the study and a curator at the Field Museum.  ""I think this study shows we have to think outside of the box, and that a catastrophic event in the solar system can have very constructive consequences on other planets, and on Earth especially.""  Accidental finding  In the 1980s, workers in a quarry in southern Sweden found meteorites contained in sedimentary rock. Birger Schmitz, lead author of this new study, trained the workers to identify further samples, and eventually more than 100 specimens were collected. Even more were found in the 1990s.  Chemical analysis of these and other, smaller meteorites yielded a surprise.  ""Oxygen has three stable forms,"" said Heck, who is also an associate professor at the University of Chicago's department of the geophysical sciences.  ""We can measure the abundance of three stable types of oxygen, and for us geochemists and cosmochemists, this is like a genetic fingerprint … and we used this to determine all of the meteorites found in the middle-Ordovician sediment, and all of the micrometeorites — including one asteroid that made a crater — they all came from one single source: the L-chondrite parent body.""  There are three types of groups of ordinary chondrites: L-chondrite (low-iron), H-chondrite (high-iron) and LL-chondrites (low-iron, low-metal). L- and H-chondrites are considered ""ordinary"" chondrites as most meteorites collected today belong to these two groups.   But, as Heck puts it, ""Before the breakup L-chondrites weren't ordinary.""    In this new study, the researchers went back to Sweden to examine dust contained in sedimentary rock. This dust would be too small to have been noticed. What they found was this, too, matched the L-chondrite parent body. And it also coincided with the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event (GOBE).   ""Everything matches and … lead us to conclude that this extraterrestrial dust likely played an important role in cooling, and that triggered biodiversification. It's not that we have absolute proof of it, but we have very good evidence that it was an important factor.""  Heck said that this new paper is merely a hypothesis about what could have contributed to the chilly period, and the subsequent rise in marine life, not that it was the only factor. But it's one with which he's fairly confident.  ""This is an important hypothesis. I think it's very plausible,"" he said. ""I think one of the things that needs to be done is to use our ground-truth data from the sediments, feed it into a paleoclimatological model and see how this plays out.""    Roger Summons, a Schlumberger professor of geobiology at MIT, agrees that more investigation needs to be done.  ""It's a very interesting paper and, from my knowledge of the authors' prior work, very solid,"" he said. ""But the geological data comes from two sections in Sweden and Russia so, I guess, the obvious question to ask next is where else could these observations be checked.""  Heck said another important part to this study is that it highlights that what happens elsewhere in the solar system could have profound effects on Earth.  ""It's important to realize that not everything is a closed system,"" Heck said. ""Extraterrestrial events can have important consequences.""",technology
105,Climate change and the personal sacrifice debate on the campaign trail,"There's a political gamble involved in climate change promises.    As the country gears up for the federal election, all the major parties are offering a vision for how they would deal with Canada's climate concerns. These plans vary in goal, process and degrees of specificity, yet on the campaign trail they all need to be sold to the public.   It could be a tough sell.   ""It's one of the important things about this election,"" said George Hoberg at the University of British Columbia's School of Public Policy and Global Affairs. He specializes in environmental and natural resource policy.  ""Canadians are confronting the stark choices about what kind of contribution they want to make to the global effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,"" Hoberg said.  The party platforms require some form of sacrifice from all of us — whether as businesses or as individuals. How much and what kind of  sacrifice is a matter of debate scientifically and politically.   ""We have seen the polarization of climate [change] occurring throughout the world,"" said Duane Bratt, a political science professor at Mount Royal University.  ""There was a time where there was a consensus on this and now it is largely split. We see it dramatically in the United States, we're seeing it in Canada as well,"" said Bratt.  The language, the rhetoric and substance of each party's climate action plan will have been cautiously nuanced and aligned to overall party values and core voters. But it also will have to take into account the public's tolerance for self-sacrifice so as not to alienate potential voters.     PLATFORM TRACKER | Compare the party platforms on top election issues    During election campaigns, people are perhaps more accustomed to being told what they will get from a party, not what they will have to give up.   It is more difficult for political parties to suggest substantive personal sacrifices to tackle CO2 emissions.  ""The thing is with science, it is apolitical,"" said Seth Wynes, a PhD student at the University of British Columbia. Wynes researches the personal choices that have the highest impact on climate change.  ""And so the science tells us that we need to make drastic changes in our society if we want to mitigate climate change,"" Wynes said.  Science may be apolitical, drastic solutions usually aren't.  What are we willing to do?  The Canadian discussion around climate change is often contextualized around taxes — carbon and otherwise.   Writing about a recent poll commissioned by CBC News and conducted by Public Square Research and Maruu002FBlue, Éric Grenier said, ""while nearly two-thirds of Canadians see fighting climate change as a top priority, half of those surveyed would not shell out more than $100 per year in taxes to prevent climate change, the equivalent of less than $9 a month.""  That's about paying more, but then there's also the question of what you'd give up.      VOTE COMPASS | How do your views align with the parties?     Seth Wynes says switching to energy efficient light bulbs, recycling and eliminating plastic bags isn't going to cut it. His suggestions: fly less, have fewer kids, give up the car or go electric, and try a plant-based diet. Such recommendations are becoming more common discussion points in the global conversation around climate change.     Hundreds of young Canadians have pledged not to have any kids until the government gets serious about tackling climate change. In Vancouver, some academics are trying to limit flying. And the United Nations is recommending people eat less meat.   While these ideas may seem pretty ""out there,"" and there is no consensus around the necessity of such recommendations, they are, and will continue to be, debated, challenged and scrutinized. But not likely on the campaign trail.   ""Sometimes those drastic changes might not seem palatable to politicians,"" Wynes said.  Who is suggesting what?  Let's take a look at what the parties are saying as gathered on our very own CBC News interactive on the party platforms:  The Liberals' controversial carbon tax remains the centrepiece of the party's climate change plan. The tax is currently $20u002Ftonne of greenhouse gas emissions, or roughly 4.4 centsu002Flitre of gasoline. It will climb $10u002Ftonne every year until it reaches $50u002Ftonne in 2022. And there will be rebates for many Canadians.  The Liberals also say they will phase out coal power by 2030, ban single use plastics by 2021, and end some fuel subsidies by 2025.   The Conservatives promise to reduce carbon emissions by investing in green technology, funded in part by polluters who fail to meet new standards. But it's unclear which industry would be targeted or how much they would have to pay.  The New Democrats are in favour of continuing with a carbon tax and the rebate program. However, Leader Jagmeet Singh wants to crack down more on heavy emitters.   Green Party Leader Elizabeth May supports the carbon tax. She says putting a price on carbon has been ""one of the cornerstones of Green Party climate policy for many years."" She feels the climate reduction target Canada agreed to is not sufficient and hopes to double it.     Sign up for our Canada Votes newsletter    The Bloc Québécois is in favour of a carbon tax and is pushing for green equalization payments. They envision higher taxes for provinces with greater greenhouse gas emissions.   The People's Party plans to get rid of the carbon tax and will allow provinces to voluntarily reduce emissions.  The merits of each of the above plans will be hotly contested — politically, socially and scientifically. Yet the core idea is there for each party: ""something needs to be done, so we are going to do something."" That something primarily involves taxes.   In fairness, it's possible more specific details will come out during the campaign. But it's unlikely we'll see platforms recommending fewer children or less meat.  Even when it comes to carbon taxes, there are criticisms that the plans are weak on specific details.  Bold promises and reluctance  ""This is what politicians tend to do,"" Hoberg said.   To look at the two biggest parties, political pressure may be preventing either the Liberals or Conservatives from putting forward highly specific numbers that would meet Canada's Paris commitment.   ""They tend to put forward bold promises but are reluctant to commit themselves to significant actions that may cost constituencies that are very important to them and obviously to the Conservatives,"" he said.  When it comes to tackling climate change, the oft-touted goal is to meet our commitments under the Paris Agreement. Canada has pledged to an economy-wide target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030.       Fighting climate change is not like fighting a war. It's harder     ""None of the expert community that analyzes climate policies considers the Conservative plan a real plan,"" said Hoberg.   ""The Conservatives have a target but they don't have a plan that can plausibly meet that target,"" he said.  But, Hoberg says, while it's easier to measure the potential impact of the Liberal plan, that, too, will fall short of Canada's 2030 targets.    ""Their plan is stronger and more coherent but also comes short of meeting their goal,"" he said.  The Office of the Parliamentary Budget Officer has estimated the carbon tax will have to double from its projected 2022 rate to $102u002Ftonne in order for Canada to meet its 2030 Paris Agreement target. Trying to sell numbers like that could cost votes.  ""Climate policy has been extremely polarizing within the federal electoral environment,"" Hoberg said.   While the Conservatives fear upsetting their base in Alberta and Saskatchewan, the Liberals may be held back by opposition to the carbon tax in a number of provinces, including vote rich Ontario, where 121 seats are up for grabs.   ""It has been very politically challenging for him [Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau], especially given the opposition coming from Alberta and now from Ontario as well,"" said Hoberg.  According to poll aggregator 338Canada.com, the Liberals have just 15 seats considered ""safe"" in Ontario and another 33 identified as ""likely"" wins.      CBC News Interactive: Swing ridings     Hoberg recalls that in 2008, when former Liberal leader Stephane Dion introduced the Green Shift plan, it drew fire from then Conservative leader Stephen Harper — and likely cost the Liberals the election.  He says current Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer has adopted ""many of the same rhetorical tactics and political strategies"" that Harper did.  Bratt agrees the debate hasn't changed much over the years.  ""The Liberals are saying if you don't support the federal carbon tax, you're a climate change denier; and the Conservatives, on the other hand, say that the carbon tax has nothing to do with the climate, it's simply a tax grab,"" he said.  This is the debate over a carbon tax, no less a debate over the idea of giving up vacations that require airplanes, watermelon in February, or that third child.  We're not ready  ""The public isn't prepared for that kind of discussion,"" said David Taras, a professor of communication studies at Calgary's Mount Royal University.   ""The public doesn't have ears yet to listen to this, and the parties could look foolish, extreme, bizarre and marginal.""  ""Those are the dangers, that you're just so out of kilter with public expectations that you're ridiculed,"" said Taras.   Taras says politicians like to deliver ""goodies"" during campaigns, not lectures about how voters need to change their lives.  ""To have a serious discussion about climate change is not handing out goodies. It's, in fact, a change in lifestyle and getting people to make sacrifices. That's a whole different order of magnitude, and it's dangerous waters for politicians,"" he said.    The survey mentioned in this story was commissioned by CBC News and conducted by Public Square Research and Maruu002FBlue. It was conducted between May 31 and June 10, 2019, interviewing 4,500 eligible voters. Respondents for this survey were selected from among those who have registered to participate in the Maru Voice panel. The data have been weighted to reflect the demographic composition of Canada, according to Statistics Canada. Because the sample is based on those who initially self-selected for participation in the Maru Voice panel rather than a probability sample, no estimates of sampling error can be calculated. However, comparable samples of this size have a margin of error of +u002F- 1.5 per cent, 19 times out of 20.    Bryan Labby is an enterprise reporter with CBC Calgary.

28,New giant salamander species now the world's largest amphibian,"Scientists have discovered a new species of giant salamander and concluded that the largest amphibian ever recorded was a member of that species.  For a long time, scientists thought all Chinese giant salamanders, belonged to a single species, Andrias davidianus that was considered the largest amphibian in the world,  But now a genetic study of museum specimens in Canada, the U.K. and the U.S., shows there are actually three different species that live in three different river systems and mountain ranges in China.  And in fact, the largest Chinese giant salamander specimen ever recorded — a 1.8-metre-long individual bigger than most humans —  was likely a member of a newly named species from the Pearl River system in Southern China. The species is now known as the South China giant salamander and given the scientific name Andrias sligoi, scientists report this week in the journal Ecology and Evolution.  ""For me, the big take-home message is how shocking it is that [we are] just beginning to realize that world's largest amphibians are actually multiple species,"" said Samuel Turvey, a professor at the Institute of Zoology at the Zoological Society of London and lead author of the new study.  The original name for all Chinese giant salamanders, Andrias davidianus, now applies only the the species from the Yangtze river system.  A third species has also been identified from samples collected by Bob Murphy, senior curator of herpetology at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, in the Yellow Mountains of China in the 1990s. But because those samples represented only parts of animals rather than whole specimens, it could not be officially named as a new species.    Unfortunately, the museum specimens that were analyzed had been dried or preserved in different ways that made it difficult to tell what they looked like originally, which means researchers don't actually know how physically different the different species are.  Giant salamanders aren't colourful like frogs and newts.  ""They're these wonderful, weird, big brown blobs, really without that much to differentiate one individual from another,"" Turvey said.  He added that researchers are now hoping to find some living specimens of each species so they can learn how to tell them apart. Nor do they know if the different species can interbreed, although their last common ancestor was quite a while ago — more than 3 million years — and they were geographically isolated, so they would never encounter each other in the wild.  Sadly, all three species, if they still exist, ""are on the very, very edge of extinction,"" said Turvey.   They're so rare that a huge, ""exhaustive"" survey that Turvey conducted with Chinese scientists between 2013 to 2016 at almost 100 different sites where giant salamanders were expected to be found turned up only a handful of animals that, based on their genetic profile, likely escaped or were deliberately released from farms.  ""Which necessarily doesn't mean that these species are extinct, but it means that they are far, far, far rarer and more threatened than we expected,"" Turvey said.  Farming: a problem and a solution?  The species are rare in the wild partly because of poaching to stock farms that raise them as a delicacy.  ""The farming industry is a huge problem for salamander conservation, but it's there, and it's probably there to stay,"" Turvey said. Because of that, he said, it needs to be viewed as a resource for conservation.    An earlier genetic study of captive individuals suggested that they might include multiple lineages and even species, but farmed animals have been moved around so much that it was impossible to tell where those lineages might have originated.  That's what prompted the researchers to turn to museum specimens collected in the early 20th century, before the giant salamander farming industry began.  The discovery that there are multiple species is a ""game changer"" for conservation, Turvey said, as it means giant salamanders can't simply been raised in captivity and released into the wild from the nearest farm, as has been common practice.  The good news, he said, is ""it's certainly likely that many if not all of these species still exist within farms, shortly about to be sent to restaurants.""  Those could potentially be identified, bred in captivity, and released back into the wild in the right river systems.  The new Pearl River species' scientific name comes from the name originally given to one of the specimens used in the study. It was found in the Hong Kong Botanical Gardens in the 1920s, after being flushed out of a pipe or pool during a storm. It had likely been released as some kind of temple offering, Turvey said.   The animal was studied and named Megalobatrachus sligoi after the Duke of Sligo, who was visiting Hong Kong at the time, but was later reidentified with the scientific name for all Chinese giant salamanders until now, Andrias davidianus.  That animal was sent to the London Zoo, where it lived for 20 years before it died and became a specimen at the Natural History Museum in London.",technology
219,"DHX Media changing name to WildBrain, begins reorganizing company","DHX Media Ltd. is changing its corporate name to WildBrain, the name of its child-focused YouTube business, which will be renamed WildBrain Spark.  ""WildBrain Spark now averages more than three billion views per month,"" new DHX chief executive Eric Ellenbogen said Monday in his inaugural financial report to analysts.  The former president and chief executive of Marvel Enterprises also announced there will be a reorganization of the business to have a more simplified structure as it works to grow its audience while managing a large corporate debt.  Ellenbogen, who was named chief executive at DHX last month, said that it's not news that the company has faced ""some considerable challenges"" in recent years, but the changes Monday and others ahead will ""set the stage for a path forward.""     DHX Media to cut its debt with money from Peanuts deal with Sony: CEO    ""We continue to improve our financial position by generating positive operating cash flow in fiscal 2019 and paying down debt,"" Ellenbogen said.  However, Ellenbogen said repeatedly that he would be focused on long-term, sustainable growth for the company rather than quarter-to-quarter improvements.  He said that DHX has well-run business units, including WildBrain, a content creation business, and specialty television channels in Canada, but has yet to integrate them effectively.  ""It has barely begun to exploit the value of its entertainment assets,"" Ellenbogen said.    The proliferation of new streaming services also present DHX with many new opportunities, including its deal to create Peanuts programs for Apple's streaming service.  ""And to ensure we are poised to take advantage, we're planning to increase our spend against creative development,"" Ellenbogen said.  Some of the money for that increased spending, he said, will come from savings resulting from the business and management reorganization.  Chief operating officer Aaron Ames was appointed as chief financial officer to replace Doug Lamb, who has decided to step down but remain as an adviser to the Halifax-based company until the end of October.  DHX reported a fourth-quarter loss attributable to the company of $62.8 million or 47 cents per share on $108.8 million in revenue for the three months ended June 30.  The result compared with a loss of $21.6 million or 16 cents per share on $97.4 million in last year's fiscal fourth quarter.  MORE TOP STORIES:",entertainment
120,Toronto's Haviah Mighty wins 2019 Polaris Music Prize,"Haviah Mighty has won the 2019 Polaris Music Prize for her album 13th Floor.  The project, the first Polaris awarded to a female hip-hop and rap artist, was selected by an 11-member jury as the Canadian album of the year based on its artistic merit.  Mighty's first full-length solo album 13th Floor reflects on her experience as a woman of colour growing up in Canada, addressing the hurdles it presented, but also the positive inspiration her family provided. It features guest appearances by other rising Canadian rap artists, including Clairmont the Second, Sean Leon and her older sister Omega.  Mighty said the title was inspired by the concept of the 13th floor being a space North American culture pretends doesn't exist. The album draws a parallel between the 13th floor and marginalized people and communities, whose experiences she says often go unacknowledged.  She accepted the Polaris Prize saying that it's one of the few accolades she's received from years of making music, but she was grateful that her album resonated with the jury.  ""My truth, how important it is, and how dismissed it often is, I don't care about that,"" the Brampton, Ont.-raised artist said while accepting the award.  ""I've had the same thoughts and the same sentiments since high school, and every time it was 'not the time,' and it 'wasn't the place,' and here at the Polaris 2019 it is the time and the place.""  Mighty has been releasing music for a decade as an independent artist, and is also a member of all-female Toronto hip-hop act The Sorority.  The Polaris Prize is considered one of the country's most prestigious music awards. Former winners include Jeremy Dutcher, Arcade Fire, Buffy Sainte-Marie and Kaytranada.  The winner receives a $50,000 cash prize and heightened global awareness for their album.",entertainment
237,Welcome to Orcland: Amazon's Lord of the Rings to return to New Zealand,"Amazon announced Wednesday it will film its upcoming series The Lord of the Rings in New Zealand, marking a return of the orcs, elves and hobbits to the country they became synonymous with over the course of six movies directed by Peter Jackson.  Amazon Studios said it had found a great location with world-class sets and skilled staff. It said pre-production had already started and production on the series would begin in the city of Auckland over the coming months.  ""As we searched for the location in which we could bring to life the primordial beauty of the Second Age of Middle-earth, we knew we needed to find somewhere majestic, with pristine coasts, forests, and mountains,"" showrunners and executive producers J.D. Payne and Patrick McKay wrote in a statement.  But Amazon wouldn't reveal the extent of its plans for the series. It declined to say how much it plans to spend, how many seasons the show will run, or when it will debut.  Some have speculated Amazon could spend more than $1 billion (all figures US) on the series as it looks to take on other streaming services like Netflix with its Prime Video service.    New Zealand's Economic Development Minister Phil Twyford welcomed the news, saying the series would give a boost to the screen industry and create hundreds of new jobs.  ""It's a hugely significant piece of popular culture,"" Twyford said. ""And it now has a special place in New Zealanders hearts as well. We are part of Middle-earth.""    The series will be eligible for a 20 per cent screen grant rebate that will be funded by taxpayers. The conservative lobby group Taxpayers' Union said the rebate meant every New Zealand household could end up paying more than $100.  ""Who would seriously name Amazon as the most deserving recipient of our hard-earned tax dollars?"" the group wrote in a release.  But Twyford said it will be money well spent.  ""This is not a charity issue,"" he said. ""This is about bringing jobs, investment, and economic development to New Zealand.""    The series will be based on the fantasy novels by J.R.R. Tolkien. Amazon said it would explore new story lines that precede The Fellowship of the Ring.  The series won't be connected with the New Line Cinema movies, although Jackson has previously said he'd be interested in helping out. The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy and The Hobbit movie trilogy combined grossed nearly $6 billion at the box office.",entertainment

The Toronto theatre company says it will mount productions of Miss Saigon in May and Les Miserables next June.  Audiences can enjoy the sounds of the 1960s and 70s in the concert-style The Simon &amp; Garfunkel Story and the musical Summer based on the life and music of disco diva Donna Summer, from American-Canadian director Des McAnuff and Colombian-born, Canadian-raised choreographer Sergio Trujillo.

An April run of Room, based on Irish-Canadian writer Emma Donoghue's 2010 novel, at the CAA Theatre.    Donoghue, who earned an Oscar nomination for her screenplay adaptation of Room, also transformed her story for the stage.  ""I just love to see what a new genre brings out in the same old story and so adaptation is a real pleasure for me,"" the London, Ont.-based writer told CBC News on Monday.  ""I'm really genuinely trying to transform my work and see what each new form can bring out in it.""    In addition to introducing songs, the forthcoming Room adaptation also made a key change to the protagonists  — one that Donoghue believes brings complexity to the story.  ""When we did the show first in Britain and Scotland and Dublin, we cast a woman of colour and a biracial kid and I have to say that brought out a whole new set of overtones to the role,"" she explained.  In addition to literally putting new face on the character of Ma following Brie Larson's Oscar-winning turn in the movie, this casting decision for the stage version ""makes you think of so many other contemporary situations of racism, human trafficking [and] the whole history of slavery, without it being all spelled out verbally,"" Donoghue said.  ""I now think that's a crucial part and we're doing the same thing for Canadian casting.""",entertainment
183,"Cannabis product not the culprit in Ontario teen's vaping-related illness, health official says","The teen who was hospitalized with a severe vaping-related respiratory illness in London, Ont., did not use a cannabis-related product, the region's medical officer of health told CBC News.  The high-school aged person who fell ill earlier this year was in intensive care and has recovered.   Dr. Chris Mackie, medical officer of health and CEO of Middlesex-London Health Unit, said the person hadn't been vaping cannabis.  ""This person was not using those products"" that include tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, the main active ingredient in cannabis that gives users a high), Mackie said in an interview Friday. ""The person was vaping fairly heavily with a nicotine-based product.""  It is important for people to understand that the severe respiratory illness associated with vaping ""is not a remote risk"" but very real in Canada, he said.  A local physician reported an ""incident"" involving an e-cigarette product to a voluntary national database to flag potential problems related to consumer products.    But the database isn't detailed enough to classify someone as a confirmed or probable patient, said Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief medical officer of health.   There are three incident reports from across the country under investigation from the database, with at least one dating back to 2018, Tam said.    Tam did not reveal the health status of the individuals, their ages or where they're located. Rather, provinces still need to gather a thorough history of a patient's potential vaping, clinical symptoms and information on the products and devices used before any cases in the country could be confirmed.  Based on a Canadian version of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control's case definitions, Tam said physicians are on the lookout for patients with a history of vaping or e-cigarette use in the previous 90 days reporting respiratory illness such as:     Cough.   Shortness of breath.   Chest pain.   Fever.   Sometimes nausea and gastrointenstinal upset.    Doctors would first rule out any other infectious diseases before considering it a vaping-related case. As more health-care providers routinely ask people whether they vape, more suspected cases are expected to come to light.   ""If you don't vape, don't start,"" Tam said. ""Youth, pregnant women and non-smokers should not vape. Those who do vape should get their product from a regulated, approved source — for example for nicotine-vaping products. There are no current regulated sources of cannabis or THC-containing products.""  Tam said while cannabis and THC-containing products are readily available on the grey market, next month's regulations should afford protections. For instance, Health Canada will introduce rules on what ingredients can be in THC vape liquids and on how the products and devices are produced and monitored.     In the U.S., 530 confirmed and probable cases have been reported in 38 states and one U.S. territory, up from 380 a week ago. The country's eighth death was reported by state officials in Missouri on Thursday.   The CDC said most patients have reported a history of using e-cigarette products containing THC, many reported using THC and nicotine, and some have reported the use of e-cigarette products containing only nicotine.  'Paddling upstream' against marketing  No single device, ingredient, additive or pathway to illness has been identified in the U.S., federal officials there stressed.  Similarly, Mackie said his health unit is not identifying the brand used in the London case, because doing so could implicate one specific product when the international evidence isn't pointing that way.    Mackie said since Wednesday's news conference, he's received a backlash on social media from people who support vaping.  ""There is really a firm — I would say vicious — campaign on social media to criticize anyone speaking out against vaping,"" Mackie said.  Given that up to 90 per cent of teens in some of his city's schools report vaping, Mackie isn't deterred.  ""We're really paddling upstream with the amount of marketing of vaping that there is, and especially of those flavoured products which really appeal to youth.""",health
182,Green Party would decriminalize all drug possession if elected,"The Green Party would decriminalize all drug possession if elected in October, leader Elizabeth May said Saturday on the campaign trail in Winnipeg.  May said it's a necessary step to curb the opioid crisis in Canada.  ""We must stop treating drug addiction as a criminal issue. This is a national health emergency.""    May delivered the announcement in Manitoba, which is dealing with a major drug problem.  As part of their effort to lower the rate of overdose deaths, the Greens are also committing to declaring a national health emergency, increasing mental health and addiction programs, and funding community organizations. The party said it would also ensure kits with Naloxone, a medication that blocks the effects of opioids, are widely available to treat overdoses.  The issue is personal for the Green leader. Her sister-in-law, entertainer Margot Kidder, died in 2018 after battling drug addiction.  Much of the Green Party's current support comes from the Lower Mainland of British Columbia, and Vancouver Island, areas hit hard by the opioid problem, which led to the deaths of nearly 4,000 Canadians in 2017.    May said her party would consider lifting the decriminalization in the future if the drug crisis subsides.   Earlier this month, May told CBC News it's time the federal government declared the opioid crisis a national emergency and decriminalized illicit drugs to prevent deaths.  People on the front lines of the crisis have long said creating a supply of clean drugs and removing the criminal element would cut down on the number of overdose deaths.  On Saturday in Winnipeg, May said health care in Canada must ""accommodate, prepare and save lives.""  Weighing in on drug concerns  This year, a Statistics Canada report blamed stagnating life expectancy rates on deadly overdoses.  The Liberals have rejected calls to decriminalize all drugs, sticking instead with the legalization of marijuana — a 2015 campaign promise that was fulfilled last year.    Neither the Liberals nor the Conservatives have released their 2019 platforms, including on what they would do in the area of illicit drugs and how to reduce death rates.  The NDP's platform says the party would ""commit to working with all levels of government, experts and Canadians to end the criminalization and stigma of drug addiction.""",health

17,Outspoken Imperial Oil CEO Rich Kruger to step down at end of year,"One of the oilpatch's most outspoken critics of Canadian federal and provincial energy policy is retiring at the end of this year.  Imperial Oil Ltd. announced Tuesday that chairman and chief executive Rich Kruger will step down after leading the Calgary-based company, which is about 70 per cent owned by Texas-based Exxon Mobil Corp., since 2013.  In his role, Kruger complained publicly often about red tape, focusing in recent years on how long it took to win Alberta regulatory approval for the two-phase, 150,000-barrel-per-day Aspen thermal oilsands project, first proposed in 2013.  Imperial announced it would go ahead with Aspen late last year, within months of finally winning approval for the $2.6-billion project.  But it was put on hold in March due to what Kruger called market uncertainty caused in part by the former provincial NDP government's oil production curtailment program enacted in January to reduce a glut of oil trapped by output outgrowing pipeline capacity.  ""We cannot invest billions of dollars on behalf of our shareholders given the uncertainty in the current business environment,"" he said at the time.  The CEO has also taken the federal government to task over Canadian competitiveness, calling for tax parity with the U.S. and declaring Ottawa's passage of Bill C-69 to revamp how energy projects are approved would cause Imperial to reconsider any new investments in Canada.  In August, Kruger threatened to drastically reduce Imperial's crude-by-rail shipments because provincial curtailments had hurt the profitability of shipping by rail to the U.S. Gulf Coast.  He charged the programs were ""no way to run a railroad"" and added he didn't agree with rivals Suncor Energy Inc. and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. that the government should reduce curtailments for companies that add rail export capacity.  ""The last thing we want to do is ingrain the concept of curtailment, that you get relief from curtailment if you get rail,"" he said on a conference call. ""I want relief from curtailment and no curtailment. I want it done!""  While CEO, Kruger oversaw the successful construction and commissioning of the second phase of Imperial's Kearl oilsands mining project.  He was not available for an interview on Tuesday.  ""We believe it is fair to say that Rich brought a substantially higher level of intensity to the platform than the one he inherited when he joined Imperial in 2013 and that there will be some lasting effect from his tenure in the seat,"" said analyst Jon Morrison of CIBC Capital Markets in a report.  The CEO was born in Minnesota and trained as a mechanical engineer. He began his career at Exxon in 1981 and held various technical and management positions in posts in the former Soviet Union, Africa, Asia-Pacific and the Middle East before coming to Canada.  Financial analysts said they expect little change in direction under Brad Corson, a 36-year Exxon employee who will take over as president immediately and become chairman and CEO on Jan. 1.  Corson, who was born in Illinois, joined Exxon in 1983 as a project engineer and has held a variety of technical, operations, commercial and managerial assignments around the world, including leadership positions in Hong Kong and London.  He was appointed president, ExxonMobil Upstream Ventures, in 2015, where he was responsible for ExxonMobil's global upstream acquisition and divestment programs.",business
210,"Goodbye, Three Mile Island: Remaining reactor shuts down","The money-losing Three Mile Island, the 1979 site of the United States's worst commercial nuclear power accident, was shut down Friday by its energy giant owner.  The end of the 45-year electricity-producing career of Three Mile Island Unit 1 came after Chicago-based Exelon Corp. tried and failed to get financial aid from Pennsylvania in the spring.  Unit 1 opened in 1974 and was licensed to operate through 2034, but Exelon complained the plant was losing money in competitive electricity markets.  Three Mile Island also faced particularly difficult economics because the 1979 accident that destroyed Unit 2 left it with just one reactor.  Decommissioning Unit 1, dismantling its buildings and removing spent fuel could take six decades and cost more than $1 billion US, Exelon estimates, although companies specializing in the handling of radioactive material are buying retired U.S. nuclear reactors and promising to do it in under a decade.    The destroyed Unit 2 is sealed, and its twin cooling towers remain standing. Its core was shipped years ago to the U.S. Department of Energy's Idaho National Laboratory. What is left inside the containment building remains highly radioactive and encased in concrete.  Work to dismantle Unit 2 is scheduled to begin in 2041 and be completed in 2053, its owner, FirstEnergy, has said.  No nuclear plant proposed after the 1979 accident has been successfully completed and put into operation in the U.S.",technology
223,Go behind the scenes of the new Leonard Cohen album,"Howard Bilerman always dreamed of recording Leonard Cohen. He even pitched unsolicited proposals to the legendary poet-singer through the mail slot of his Montreal home in the 1990s, when he was just in his 20s.  So working on a Cohen album was an exciting experience for the 48-year-old engineer and co-owner of the hotel2tango recording studio in the city's Mile-End neighbourhood.  ""Imagine being in the position to be able to push the solo button on that,"" he said about isolating Cohen's intense, gravely voice on his studio mixing board. ""That was me.""  Cohen's son Adam had asked Bilerman and Montreal singer-songwriter Patrick Watson to add music to some of his father's solo vocals, which had previously been recorded in Los Angeles, in June 2016.     One of the songs, The Hills, was originally slated to be on Cohen's album You Want It Darker — which came out 19 days before his death that November — but wasn't ready.  Instead, it and eight other unfinished Cohen compositions will be released on the posthumous album Thanks For The Dance, out Nov. 22.   ""The record is fantastic,"" said Bilerman, who says it feels like a classic Cohen record — not one of those ""we're combing the archives for anything that we can cobble together"" albums.    In addition to recording parts of The Hills, Bilerman also helped set up Adam's home studio in L.A., a converted garage, where much of the new record was produced.  Adam had flown him down to California for Cohen's memorial service in December 2016. That was where The Hills was played publicly for the first time, as a musical backdrop to a video montage Adam had made to honour his father's life.  ""It took me about five seconds to realize, 'Oh my God that's the song that we did,'"" said Bilerman, ""I just immediately started bawling.""    Long shadow  But it wasn't the only time Adam called on his friend while making Thanks For The Dance.  In May 2018, he asked Bilerman to host famed musician-producer Daniel Lanois at hotel2tango to get his feedback on the project.  ""I don't even think the session started out as, 'Let's have Daniel Lanois play on [the] record,'"" Bilerman said. But after hearing the first song, he says, Lanois was reaching for a 12-string guitar.  ""Within two hours he had played six different instruments and sang,"" said Bilerman. ""Ideas were just oozing out of him.""  Bilerman says even Lanois, who has helmed records for giants like U2 and Bob Dylan, was humbled by the long artistic shadow cast by Cohen, even after death.  ""I feel like Daniel showed up in complete reverence to Leonard and his music,"" he said.     'Great love and pride'  Bilerman's involvement in Thanks For The Dance morphed out of his experience recording the choir from the Cohen family's synagogue for the song You Want It Darker, which won a Grammy for best rock performance in 2018  The Shaar Hashomayim choir also appears on the song Puppets on the new record, although it wasn't recorded by Bilerman.  The choir's cantor Gideon Zelermyer was tight-lipped about the recording process but says it was a tremendous honour to have played a small role in what he calls ""amazing statements"" by Cohen near the end of his life.  Zelermyer says the choir didn't hesitate when Adam called on them again.   ""He felt we had something to add to the statement so we did [it] with great love and pride,"" he said.  The new album also features performances from creative luminaries including Jennifer Warnes, Javier Mas, Feist and Richard Reed Parry of Arcade Fire.    More unreleased material   Adam says he's been moved by the response of those who've already heard Thanks For The Dance. And Zelermyer says he thinks the song his choir sang on, ""rises to the level of any of Leonard's greatest works.""  Bilerman agrees: ""It's heartbreaking to hear that voice and hear those songs,"" he said.  ""I think it's going to be really moving for people.""  He says besides the new album, more unreleased material could find its way out of the vaults.  ""I know for a fact that one of my favourite songs was left off of it."" he said. ""I'd love for it to see the light of day too.""",entertainment
165,Major oil company plans 7 wells in Alaska petroleum reserve,"A major oil company will drill seven new exploratory wells in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska.  ConocoPhillips is planning the work for this winter, the Alaska Journal of Commerce reported.  The wells will be focused on the prospective Harpoon area southwest of the company's existing projects in the reserve, ConocoPhillips Alaska vice-president Scott Jepsen said during a presentation last week to the Alaska Support Industry Alliance. The wells will better delineate the large Willow prospect.  ""We want to get more confidence around the geology and reservoir characteristics of the field, so that's one of the reasons we pushed back our startup date to around 2025-26 now for the Willow development,"" Jepsen said.  ConocoPhillips announced the Willow discovery in early 2017. The company estimates it could produce 130,000 barrels per day at its peak.  Other company plans call for shooting three-dimensional seismic data around the Putu prospect near the village of Nuiqsut. The work will require about 265 kilometres of ice roads, Jepsen said.    ""Hopefully the weather will co-operate and we'll be able to accomplish all this,"" he said.  ConocoPhillips in June announced purchase of the Nuna project from Dallas-based independent Caelus Energy. Caelus sanctioned Nuna in March 2015 and indicated that it had authorized $480 million US of expenditures on the project to that point. Caelus estimated up to 20,000 barrels per day from the project.  Jepsen said Nuna will be part of the Kuparuk River Unit and its oil will be processed through Kuparuk facilities, lowering development cost. Drilling will be done from the Nuna pad and a Kuparuk pad to minimize new infrastructure costs.  The company expects 400 labourers over one winter construction season will be able to prep the project for first production in 2022.",business

""The legal work for the oil tanker is over ... and the oil tanker can move, and the decisions indicate the end of the detention,"" government spokesperson Ali Rabiei was quoted as saying by the semi-official Fars news agency. He did not elaborate.  The July 19 seizure of the ship, two weeks after Britain detained an Iranian tanker off Gibraltar, has cranked up tensions in the region in the wake of attacks on other merchant vessels that Washington blamed on Tehran.  Iran denied responsibility for those attacks along the Strait of Hormuz, a vital international oil shipping route.  ""The legal work and administrative procedures for the release of the English tanker have been completed, but I have no information on the time of the release,"" Rabiei said, according to semi-official news agency ILNA.

Godfrey is seeking compensation for all B.C. residents who purchased the products between Jan. 1, 2004, and Jan. 1, 2010.  The proposed class also includes so-called umbrella purchasers — people who bought products that were not made or supplied by the companies in question — based on the theory that the conspiracy led other manufacturers to set higher prices as well.  Godfrey launched the main action in September 2010, but a separate one against Pioneer did not come until August 2013, leading the company to argue it began after the expiry of a two-year limitation period.",business
103,UN turns to young people for hope and vitality in climate fight,"The United Nations hopes the presence of hundreds of young people will motivate governments and corporations to take bold climate action when world leaders meet in New York City for the annual UN General Assembly next week.  On Saturday, one day after thousands of people across the planet hold marches, rallies and strikes to demand an end to the use of fossil fuels, the UN will host its first-ever Youth Climate Summit.  ""It makes utter sense that their voice be front and centre going forward now,"" says Bill McKibben co-founder of 350.org, one of the main organizers of Friday's Global Climate Strike.  The current generation of young people is the largest in human history, McKibben says. There are an estimated 1.8 billion people aged between 10 and 24.  That should make it harder for leaders to be cynical and obstructionist, ""when there are young people saying, 'guys our lives are on the line,'"" McKibben says.  ""Older people are at their best when they are thinking about the generations that come after them, when they are actually, really worrying about their children and their grandchildren.""      We're very creative in developing novel solutions and aren't afraid to create radical solutions that are completely out of the ordinary.  - Brandon Nguyen, Canadian participant     Young people are expected to bring a mix of enthusiasm, innovation, and guilt to the climate discussion that organizers hope will help jolt countries into raising their national pledges when it comes to reducing heat-trapping emissions.  ''Basically, we need to duplicate, and in some cases triplicate, what the countries have pledged in Paris to keep the temperature below to 1.5 C,"" Luis Alfonso de Alba, the UN special envoy on climate change, said this week.    Young people represent a ""powerful force"" in the fight to achieve the targets set out in the landmark 2015 agreement, he said.  ''They are consumers, they are voters, they are professionals … their own commitments could be quite significant.''  Harjeet Singh, the global lead on climate change with the charity ActionAid International, says he's not surprised the UN has decided to give ""a formal seat at the table"" to young people.  ""This is where the UN system is finding the most energy and positivity.""  Green ticket winners  The reluctant star of the Youth Climate Summit will undoubtedly be 16-year-old Swedish phenom Greta Thunberg, who started a global movement one year ago when she skipped school to sit in front of the Swedish parliament demanding political leaders do more to protect the environment.  Thunberg will be joined in New York by some 700 young activists, including 100 ""climate champions"" from around the world who have been awarded so-called green tickets to attend the summit.  The UN has provided them with ""fully-funded, carbon-neutral travel to NYC"" and about $430 US in per diems to cover food and lodging.    Pramisha Thapaliya from Nepal felt ""honoured, privileged and a huge sense of responsibility"" when she was told she'd won a free ticket to the summit.  The 22-year-old holds a degree in agricultural science and hopes one day to become the minister of Forest and Environment in her country.  Read the complete program for the Youth Climate Summit here  ""Young people are bold and desperate,"" declared Maja Starosta from Poland. ""What we can do is push [leaders] with our presence.""  The 25-year-old lawyer develops programs on climate education, sustainable investing and options for shifting to renewable energy jobs. Her wish is to convince fellow lawyers to stop working for fossil fuel industries.  Young see more at stake — poll  ""Imagine,"" she says, ""we could end global warming.""  A majority of teenagers in the U.S. believe global warming is caused by humans and that it will personally hurt them and their generation, the Washington Post reported earlier this week, citing a poll it did with the Kaiser Family Foundation.  ""Young people have a lot more at stake when it comes to these issues,"" says Brandon Nguyen, Canada's green ticket winner. The 19-year-old university student created a forum to connect high-school environment clubs in Toronto.  He also worked with NGOs to develop curriculums on renewable energy for teachers across Canada. ""Collaboration on this scale and backed by the UN is basically unprecedented,"" says Nguyen.  He also thinks the youth summit is a no-brainer. ""We're very creative in developing novel solutions and aren't afraid to create radical solutions that are completely out of the ordinary.""    Haya Almansoori from the United Arab Emirates admits she's ""not that into sciences"" but likes exploring which is what led her to discover a new way to generate electricity using heated sand when she was sixteen and still in high-school.  She plans to give out copies of her research to policymakers and business leaders when she is in New York. The 20-year-old also helped build a greenhouse out of 25,500 plastic water bottles at the American University of Sharjah, north of Dubai, where she is taking international studies.  ""It was really fun,"" said  Almansoori of  the three-year project.  And yet while some explore alternative solutions, others are quickly running out of options.  Komal Kumar says at least three villages in Fiji have already been relocated to higher ground because of rising sea levels — caused by melting ice sheets and glaciers — while another 435 communities have been identified as being ""at risk.""  The 27-year-old has a degree in public health. She's now doing a master's with a focus on climate-induced relocation.  ""It's very sad to know that this is actually happening,"" says Kumar.  Planned relocation guidelines  People are not just leaving behind the land where their ancestors are buried. Many in the Pacific region also feel like ""they're leaving behind their identity.""  In December, the government of Fiji laid out its Planned Relocation Guidelines. Kumar is looking into the impact the new policy is having on affected populations.  She will join Thunberg and Secretary General Antonio Guterres in delivering opening remarks at the Youth Climate Summit on Saturday.  Commitments put forward by the participants will be presented via video during the opening ceremony of the leaders' summit on Monday.  Scaled up and replicated  Thunberg and two other young people will take to the stage with the UN secretary general to present climate demands and solutions to world leaders gathered in the General Assembly hall.  The UN says those ideas ""which can be scaled up and replicated"" will be included in the secretary general's outcome report.  ""Everyone is really looking forward to it,"" says Kumar. ""Just to point out to the world leaders 'you know, this is what we want, and this is what you have to do, so you will have to accept it because this is our future that you are talking about, and you don't have the authority to come over and tell us that … we cannot meet your demands.'""  The leaders' summit, which will include private sector pledges, is being used as a springboard to 2020, when as many as 30,000 delegates will meet in Glasgow for the 26th Conference of the Parties, known as COP26, and the crucial implementation phase of the Paris Agreement is set to begin.",technology
63,"Trudeau not acting in 'good faith' on PBO platform costing, economist says","Justin Trudeau's Liberals have ""gamed"" a process the party itself created to increase the transparency of fiscal promises during elections, an economist says.  In their 2015 platform, the Liberals pledged to expand the mandate of the Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO) to include the estimated costs of various campaign commitments. They said at the time it ""would help Canadians make informed decisions"" and give voters a ""credible, non-partisan way to compare each party's fiscal plans.""  The proposal was enshrined in legislation after the Liberals formed government, making the current election campaign the first under the PBO's expanded mandate.  Unlike the Tories and New Democrats, however, the Liberals have so far neglected to release PBO estimates for the nearly $4 billion worth of campaign promises they've made to date.    While Trudeau said Wednesday that his campaign will release a fully-costed platform, along with the PBO's analysis of big ticket items, ""in the coming weeks,"" some are asking whether the Liberals are flouting the spirit of a process they created.  ""The NDP and the Conservatives came to the table to engage in good faith, and I think a lot of people had assumed the Liberals would do the same,"" said Rob Gillezeau, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Victoria, who once worked in the office of former NDP leader Tom Mulcair.   ""Good faith"" matters because the parties' participation in the process is voluntary. And the PBO can only release a cost estimate of a particular promise with written permission from the party that requested it.  Other parties left 'burned'  That means that if Trudeau's campaign has received results from the PBO, it has decided to sit on them until a later date.  The PBO's guidelines do not expressly state that cost estimates need to be released alongside announcements, but Gillezeau said that was widely understood to be the practice when the policy was developed.    ""I think the fact that one of the major parties decided to play politics with it has been really damaging,"" said Gillezeau.  According to the Liberal campaign, many of the measures it intends to roll out are interrelated. A series of individual cost estimates would fail to capture the bigger picture of its fiscal plan, a party spokesperson said.  Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer argued that the Liberals are trying to limit scrutiny of their ""terrible fiscal record.""    Gillezeau said the Liberals' decision to make platform announcements without accompanying cost estimates has undermined the transparency the new PBO process was meant to foster.  ""For the other parties that took a chance and engaged, they are probably feeling a little burned,"" he said.  Tactical campaign decision  Mostafa Askari, chief economist at the Institute of Fiscal Studies and Democracy at the University of Ottawa, said that the Liberal approach is ""frustrating"" for the public — but there's still plenty of time left in the campaign for financial transparency.  ""The spirit of the legislation is that all of the party's fiscal measures should be costed by the PBO. When to release them — that's a different issue,"" said Askari, who served as deputy PBO for nearly a decade until he left the role in 2018.  ""The parties have their own strategies and tactics for releasing this kind of information.""  Waiting to publish cost estimates means more time to modify proposals or react to what rival parties have rolled out on the trail, he added.  The move to expand the PBO mandate to include analysis of election promises was not applauded by everyone when it was first floated. Ken Boessenkool, a long-time Conservative staffer at both the federal and provincial levels, was among the critics.    Boessenkool, who calls himself an ""early and persistent"" opponent of broadening the purview of the PBO to include elections, said that parties themselves should bear the responsibility for credibly costing their platforms. He was behind the Ontario Progressive Conservatives' decision to have one of their recent platforms independently analyzed by Kevin Page, Canada's former PBO.  ""It was a signal to the public that the party was serious,"" said Boessenkool, currently a partner at KTG Public Affairs.  A non-partisan government institution like the PBO should have no role in campaigns, which are inherently partisan exercises, he said.  The current politicking over the PBO's cost estimates for Liberal promises seems to be validating those concerns, Gillezeau said.",politics
85,Why this mom is struggling to have her sick infant's formula covered by the province,"An Ontario mother whose infant relies on a specific formula that costs $200 a week is in a difficult bind now that the government of Premier Doug Ford has rolled back the OHIP+ pharmacare program.  She's trying to get the costs covered by the province, because her private insurance won't cover it. But the province won't cover it, because she already has private health insurance.   Elysha Wilkinson's seven-month old, Adaline, was born with a rare genetic disorder called Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome, which affects her physical growth and intellectual development.   ""It was devastating. The life that you dream for your child ... It's really hard,"" said Wilkinson.     As a result of the disorder, her daughter has severe digestive and gastro-intestinal reflux issues and has been unable to keep anything down except for a formula called Puramino A+.   ""She was vomiting 24u002F7, almost every single feed. She was screaming,"" said Wilkinson.   Aside from physiotherapy and cardiologist appointments, her parents have been worrying about the $200 a week price tag. Because they have private insurance, OHIP+ doesn't cover it. However, their private insurance won't pay for it, either.   ""It's not a choice. We're not choosing to put our daughter on this.""    This spring, Ontario rolled back a Liberal plan that covered all prescriptions for people under 25. The province will now only cover drug costs for people under 25 who don't have private health insurance. The move was projected to save $250 million.      How young women's access to birth control in Ontario will change April 1   OHIP+ no longer covers kids, young adults with private insurance, new health minister says    Natalie Mehra, president of the Ontario Health Coalition, said she was ""shocked and appalled"" by Wilkinson's situation.  ""It makes no sense to have a public health system and get a diagnosis, but you can't afford the cure.""   While Mehra said this is the first she's heard of the situation, France Gelinas, the NDP's health critic and MPP for Nickel Belt, says she knows of several families who have similar problems.   In April, the New Democrats questioned Ontario Health Minister Christine Elliott about the story of a Niagara Falls mother who was paying $600 a month for the same formula. Elliott said she would look into it.   ""Don't balance the budget on the shoulders of sick, newborn babies,"" said Gelinas.     The Ministry of Health told CBC News families with high medication costs are eligible to be covered under the Trillium Drug Program. That involves paying an upfront deductible of four per cent of the household after-tax income.   Wilkinson says she and her husband are hesitant to apply because they don't yet know how long Adaline will need what her mother calls the ""lifesaving"" formula.   ""She's not able to have anything else.""",health
39,Muslim theatre company challenges perceptions with 'Spun' in Centaur debut ,"Should a British play about two Pakistani friends dealing with malicious whispers and microaggressions be rewritten to take place in Quebec?  That's one of the questions the artists at the Silk Road Institute asked themselves when they decided to perform Spun by Rabiah Hussain — a play about two friends living in London after the 2005 terror attacks.  The characters struggle to process how people's attitudes toward them changed after the bombing. One decides to distance herself from her roots, while the other embraces them.  The play — still firmly set in London — opens at the Centaur Theatre this week.   ""We thought this is perfect for bringing to Quebec audiences because when they first come into the world of the play, they're able to have some distance,"" said director Mercedeh Baroque.  She thinks that approaching it this way means Montreal audiences won't feel as self-conscious while watching the play.  By the end of the show, people will, ideally, walk away asking questions about what can be done in terms of Muslim representation in the media and politics, she said.  ""People need to know what kind of impact these discussions in the public sphere are having on young Muslims,"" Baroque said.    Enter Centaur Theatre  This is the second play by the Silk Road Institute, which initially billed itself as ""Canada's first professional theatre company dedicated to celebrating Muslim stories.""    Its first production, The Domestic Crusaders, was staged last year at a small space in Montreal's Notre-Dame-de-Grâce neighbourhood.  Centaur Theatre's artistic director Eda Holmes attended the show and was impressed by the company. She hoped to bring a future show to the Centaur stage.  ""Because they're the first self-identified Muslim theatre company in Montreal, I wanted to see their work,"" Holmes said.  She met Silk Road's founder, Mohamed Shaheen, who spoke about Spun and how relevant it would be for Canadian audiences.    They decided that staging it at Centaur, Montreal's oldest English-language theatre company, would be a way to get as many people invested in the conversation as possible.  Baroque, the director, hopes children and teenagers from minority groups in particular will attend the show.  ""Young people who are a part of a minority group have to deal with this coming-of-age struggle much sooner than the majority groups,"" she said.    She thinks the play will help them process how they are portrayed in the media, so that they can develop a healthier, more nuanced understanding of themselves and their culture.    For Holmes, it's another step toward cementing Centaur as a space that nurtures young artists in the city.  ""We're trying to expand everyone's notion of what English theatre can be in Montreal,"" Holmes said.    Spun is on at the Centaur Theatre (453 St-Francois Xavier Street) from September 19 to 28.",entertainment
8,Federal Green Party pledges investment in sustainable mining,"The leader of the federal Green Party of Canada is clarifying some misinformation about the party's stance on mining.  In the party's platform, there is a line that states that ""no new pipelines, or coal, oil or gas drilling or mining, including offshore wells, will be approved.""  The platform also states that the party plans to ""support the transition of the mining sector to an innovation hub for greener technologies.""  It also pledges $40 million for the proposed Sudbury-based mining innovation cluster.    Some have questioned what the promises mean for the mining sector.  Party leader Elizabeth May says the promise is meant to encourage more sustainable practices in mining.  ""This is from a Sudbury-based mining support consortium that want to ensure they can reduce their dependence on fuels and do more with electricity,"" she said.  ""It's entirely in favour of sustainable mining, not phasing out mining, that's a bizarre misinterpretation.""  May says the investment into greener technologies in mining could impact the market globally.",politics
73,U.S. central bank cuts interest rate again — but split on what to do next,"A sharply divided Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate Wednesday for a second time this year, but indicated it may not cut rates any further this year.  The Fed's move will reduce its benchmark rate — which influences many consumer and business loans — by an additional quarter point to a range of 1.75 per cent to 2 per cent.  The action was approved 7-3, with two officials preferring to keep rates unchanged and one arguing for a bigger half-point cut. It was the most Fed dissents in three years.  The divisions on the policy committee underscored the challenges confronting chairman Jerome Powell in guiding the Fed at time of high uncertainty in the U.S. economy.  Stock reaction  Stock prices tumbled after the Fed issued its statement, reflecting disappointment it had declined to indicate that more rate cuts are likely this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 150 points an hour later.  The economic expansion appears durable in its 11th year of growth, with a still-solid job market and steady consumer spending. But the Fed is trying to combat threats including uncertainties caused by President Donald Trump's trade war with China, slower global growth and a slump in American manufacturing. The Fed notes in a policy statement that ""business fixed investment and exports have weakened.""  The Fed's modest rate cut irritated Trump, who has attacked the central bank and insisted it slash rates more aggressively. The president immediately signalled his discontent on Twitter    Updated economic and interest rate forecasts issued Wednesday by the Fed show that only seven of 17 officials foresee at least one additional rate cut this year. And at least two Fed officials expect a rate hike next year.  None of the policymakers foresee rates falling below 1.5 per cent in 2020 — a sign the turbulence from a global slowdown and Trump's escalation of the trade war is viewed as manageable.  The median forecasts show the economy is expected to grow a modest 2.2 per cent this year, 2 per cent next year and 1.9 per cent in 2021. Those forecasts are well below the Trump administration's projection that the president's policies will accelerate growth to 3 per cent annually or better. But they also suggest policymakers do not envision a recession.    Unemployment is projected to be 3.7 per cent and inflation 1.5 per cent, below the Fed's target level of 2 per cent.  A resumption of trade talks between the Trump administration and Beijing and a less antagonistic tone between the two sides have supported the view that additional rate cuts might not be necessary. So has a belief that oil prices will remain elevated, that inflation might finally be reaching the Fed's target level and that there are increasing signs that the U.S. economy remains sturdy.  The job market looks solid, wages are rising, consumers are still spending, and even sluggish sectors such as manufacturing and construction have shown signs of rebounding.  Yet no one, perhaps not even the Fed, is sure of how interest rate policy will unfold in coming months. Too many uncertainties exist, notably the outcome of Trump's trade war.  Trump wants even lower rates  Trump has in the meantime kept up a stream of public attacks on the central bank's policymaking, including referring to Powell as an ""enemy"" and the Fed's policymakers as ""boneheads."" Even though the economy looks resilient, the president has insisted the Fed slash its benchmark rate more deeply — even to below zero, as the European Central Bank has done — part to weaken the U.S. dollar and make American exports more competitive.  Powell has said policymakers remain focused on sustaining the expansion and keeping prices stable without regard to any outside pressures.    The Fed is monitoring the global slowdown, especially in Europe, and the U.K.'s effort to leave the European Union. A disruptive Brexit could destabilize not just Europe but the U.S. economy, too.  U.S. inflation, which has long been dormant, has begun to show signs it is reaching the Fed's two per cent target and might remain there. If the Fed's policymakers conclude that inflation will sustain a faster pace, it might give them pause about cutting rates much further.  The most serious threat to the expansion is widely seen as Trump's trade war. The increased import taxes he has imposed on goods from China and Europe — and the counter-tariffs other nations have applied to U.S. exports — have hurt many American companies and paralyzed their plans for investment and expansion.  In recent days, the Trump administration and Beijing have acted to de-escalate tensions before a new round of trade talks planned for October in Washington. Yet most analysts foresee no significant agreement emerging this fall in the conflict, which is fundamentally over Beijing's aggressive drive to supplant America's technological dominance.",business
164,TSX closes at record high as oil rally continues,"The Toronto Stock Exchange's benchmark stock index closed at an all-time high of 16,899 on Friday as strong oil prices buoyed the market.  The S&amp;Pu002FTSX Composite Index pushed as high as 16,947 on Friday, within striking distance of 17,000 points.  While it hasn't made as many of the large jumps that other stock indexes have made in recent months, Canada's benchmark stock index has quietly put together a solid rally by stacking small gains on top of each other. It is up 18 per cent since the beginning of the year.  The TSX has gained in eight of the last nine trading sessions, based on strength in the two sectors that tend to drive its fortunes: banks and oil companies.  Together, those two sectors make up almost 50 per cent of the index, and both have been steadily marching higher for a while now.    Strong run for energy  Energy companies in particular have had a strong week after attacks on Saudi oil facilities by drones believed to have been controlled by Iranian forces prompted fears of war in the Middle East, which would lead to lower oil supplies and drive up the price of Canada's crude.  The TSX inched up despite data from Statistics Canada released Friday showing relatively weak retail sales that grew by just 0.4 per cent in August, less than expected. Ordinarily, a sign that consumers aren't opening their wallets would nudge the stock market lower, but underlying strength elsewhere is seemingly enough to offset that sentiment.  ""Any disappointment from the retail sales number that may appear in the market today could be offset by improving sentiment toward energy stocks as energy commodity prices continue to climb,"" said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at SIA Wealth Management in Toronto.  Stocks veered lower on Wall Street in afternoon trading Friday after reports that a Chinese delegation has cut short a visit to the United States fuelled speculation that upcoming talks aimed at resolving the costly trade war between Washington and Beijing are in trouble.  Contradictory signals from U.S. President Donald Trump have Chinese negotiators on edge, and traders say the uncertainty means bad news for American companies.  The Dow Industrial Average fell 160 points to 26,935.    The U.S. oil benchmark WTI was above $58 US a barrel on Friday, compared to $54.92 a week earlier. That's down from $62 earlier in the week after news of the Saudi oil attack broke, but still the highest price for benchmark contract since May.

36,"I love you, Newfoundland, but I can no longer be your kitchen party poster boy","For years, I provided the soundtrack to a million brain-numbing buzzes.  For two decades, I was gainfully employed as one of Newfoundland and Labrador's most popular exports: the excellent folk pop party boy band Great Big Sea.  That success came at a cost, though. It's a story that involves addiction — and overcoming sexual abuse.  I'm now 52, and I'm stronger than I've ever been, but I have to wonder how I now fit in with the ""Newfoundland brand"" I once worked so hard to sell.    First, let me tell you about where I came from.  I was born in Carbonear and my people come from Gull Island and Northern Bay.   When I was two years old, my dad got a job in the ""city state"" of St. John's so I was raised a townie but we always kept our hearts close to where we came from.  My grandfather Jeremiah McCann taught me how to clean a fish, cut and haul wood, and handle a dory, essential skills for any self-respecting bayman to possess. He had spent the vast majority of his 98 years on this earth labouring as a fisherman, carpenter, coal miner, and swiler to spare his 16 children from starvation.    He was a gentle and quiet man with hard-working hands swollen as big as his head and even in his old age local ""hangashores"" were careful to keep their distance. Whenever I introduced him to my friends from town, instead of asking where they were from, he would pose the far deeper question, ""Where do you belong?""  Selling the 'kitchen party' brand  Great Big Sea was born out of the collapse of the cod fishery in 1992 and the subsequent lack of employment opportunities at home, our big little local band decided to give the music business a go.  Somehow, through shared determination and some very good luck, we managed to build a lucrative career singing traditional Newfoundland folk songs and selling the ""kitchen party"" brand.    We sold almost two million CDs (remember those?) and hoisted at least double that many ""sociables"" at thousands of soldout shows all over North America, all the while extolling the many virtues of Newfoundland and Labrador and inviting everyone to visit.  A great many did, and for a time we were hailed as the province's brightest ambassadors and even bore the tourism campaign logos on our tour bus.  In truth, this was no heavy burden because we were all genuinely proud of where we came from and eager to help promote the fledgling tourism industry as an economic offset to the devastating loss of our fishery.  We sang our hearts out every night preaching the Newfoundland gospel and for 20 years we were arguably the best Saturday night Canada ever had.   The dark side of Saturday night  Unfortunately for me, every night was Saturday night.   I am an addict and for 30 years I used alcohol and drugs to help me forget a painful past.  I was sexually abused by my priest as a teenager and I carried that secret around inside until it almost killed me.  It wasn't until I sobered up and faced my truth in 2011 that I was finally able to move forward and slowly recover.  Séan McCann wrote the song One Good Reason based on the conversation he had with his wife Andrea in November 2011, when he realized he needed to stay sober:     My sobriety was hard won and came with some serious side effects.  St. John's is the Canadian equivalent of the legendary New Orleans of Louisiana and its reputation as a hard partying town has been well earned and definitely deserved.  I certainly did my bit bragging about the benefits of its prolific pub scene and spent most of my nights home bar-hopping with my drinking buddies.  When I finally put the bottle down these ""friends"" were nowhere to be found. My phone stopped ringing and I was left alone.    A lust for liquor was apparently the only real thing we had in common, and as an alcoholic living in St. John's I found it very difficult to make new friends who were willing to support my alcohol-free lifestyle.  This isolation, I have learned, is a common side effect of sobriety encountered by thousands of addicts before me.  Life at work was no less lonely, and although I managed to remain sober on the great big bus for our 20th anniversary tour in 2013 (an achievement for which I shall remain forever proud), the tension it caused would ultimately prove too much to bear.  For the sake of my family and my own recovery, I walked away from my extremely well-paying job and the only home I ever knew and, at the age of 48, relocated to Ottawa to start all over again.  I have no regrets.  The hardest decision  Aside from actually getting clean, leaving Newfoundland was the hardest thing I've ever had to do.  Four years later I am still sober and I still have my family … and my life. Change is never easy but often necessary for survival. This is especially true for an alcoholic in recovery and I am grateful for all the new friends I have made along the way.  Through it all, music has remained my constant and faithful companion and I still earn my living doing what I love to do most; singing and sharing my truth with others so they too might learn how to help themselves.  Today I sing a different kind of song.    It's not about partying in the kitchen and drinking your troubles away, but about doing the hard work of actually facing your problems and trying to overcome them.  A secret can kill you but a song can save your life, and I intend to make sure every single song I have left in me is sung with that purpose in mind.  It's been fully 25 years since I last toured rural Newfoundland. When I was invited to speak at this year's Provincial Student Leadership Conference, I saw an opportunity to share my experience with local teenagers in the hopes of sparing them from the life of addiction I endured and was lucky to survive.  I've travelled this country as a keynote speaker for the past four years, sharing my story and singing my heart out for tens of thousands of addicts, survivors, and frontline workers who have, in turn, shared their own stories with me.  It is a powerful connection and one I never take for granted. I have learned that people drink and use drugs for reasons and my own addiction began as a direct result of the trauma I suffered from sexual abuse as a teenager growing up in Newfoundland.  I know exactly how it feels to be young and in trouble, alone and afraid, and I hope my experience will help today's youth cope with the problems they too will face.  I also know how incredibly easy it is to develop an alcohol dependency in my old hometown.  Immune from scrutiny  Drinking has become engrained in Newfoundland's cultural identity and enjoys a certain immunity from local scrutiny and concern.  But it is no less dangerous.    On Nov. 9, I will be eight years sober. Recovery has shown me my true voice and I have found the best version of myself singing and sharing my truth openly with people.  I was once very lost but now I know exactly where I ""belong.""  Today I sing a song of sobriety, survival, and sharing personal truth. I still wear my Newfoundland heart on my sleeve with pride everywhere I go but now my ""ranting and roaring"" is all about recovery.  I love you, Newfoundland, and I miss you very much but I can no longer be your kitchen party poster boy.  I hope we still have some songs left together to sing.  Séan McCann will be touring Newfoundland and Labrador in October, with appearances in Corner Brook, Placentia, Marystown, Clarenville, English Harbour and Twillingate.

200,"California's chronic water overuse leads to sinking towns, arsenic pollution","When you walk through Jeannie Williams's sunny orchard, you don't notice anything wrong. But the problem's there, underfoot. The land around her — about 250 square kilometres — is sinking.  ""It's frightening,"" Williams says. ""Is the land going to come back up? I don't know.""  She points out the well from which she obtains all of the water she needs to grow organic fruits and vegetables. The well is small and shallow; she only has two acres of crops to water. But her neighbours are far more thirsty, and have been for a very long time.  Her farm in Hanford is located in California's Central Valley, a 47,000 square kilometre area that produces about a quarter of America's food supply — and a large part of the $3.6 billion US worth of produce that California exports to Canada.  For more than a century farmers in the Central Valley have been pumping water out of the ground — so much so that the land is slowly sinking, a process known as subsidence. In less than 100 years, it's dropped 8½ metres.  ""Some areas actually are sinking one to two feet [30-60 centimetres] a year,"" says recently retired NASA geologist Tom Farr. ""That's a huge amount.""    For years, researchers like Farr have used satellites to measure exactly how far and how fast the ground is sinking. A recent graphic of the southern Central Valley produced by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography shows a dark purple area indicating the most serious area of subsidence.  ""It's relatively confined to that area around Corcoran, and it's about 30 or 40 miles [50 to 65 km] across, so it's not small,"" Farr says.    Corcoran, only 30 kilometres south of Williams's farm in Hanford, bills itself as the ""Farming Capital of California."" No surprise that it's also the state's subsidence capital. But it's far from alone. The latest survey by the California Department of Water Resources found almost 40 sites with significant levels of subsidence.  ""We're just pumping too much groundwater, especially in the agricultural areas in the Central Valley,"" Farr says.  A Stanford University study published in the journal Water Resources Research found that unless action is taken, the ground in that region will sink more than four metres over the next 20 years.  And the region is already feeling the effects.    In a tiny white shed next to a vineyard in Terra Bella, Calif., groundwater hydrologist Michelle Sneed unspools a cable that will snake more than 300 metres down into the earth.  ""As the land subsides, more of this pipe will appear to protrude from the casing,"" Sneed says. She checks some gauges and taps a few notes into her laptop. This was a wet year, Sneed says, and still the ground sank more than 2.5 centimetres.  ""It is quite a bit when you're talking about the impact to canals,"" Sneed says.  She's talking about canals like the one just metres up an embankment from the shed: the Friant-Kern Canal. It's a 250-kilometre-long aqueduct that delivers water to 15,000 farms.    ""This canal really is critical for water delivery,"" Sneed says, walking along its bank.  But the system depends on gravity, and now the ground has sunk so much in some spots the water has to travel uphill, turning the canal in some places into essentially a deep pool.  ""And so that impacts the ability of the canal to actually move water,"" Sneed says.  ""It can only transmit about 40 per cent of the water that it was designed to transmit. And there are other things too: roads, railways, pipelines, any sort of long infrastructure that crosses these areas of what we call differential subsidence are impacted.""  Subsidence also reduces the ability of the earth itself — composed largely of clay — to store water.  ""Those randomly oriented clay grains will start to realign themselves into a stack,"" Sneed says, which takes up less space, leading to the land sinking. ""But also now there's less space to store water.""    A 2019 study by researchers at Arizona State University found that the aquifer system in the San Joaquin Valley at the heart of the Central Valley lost up to three per cent of its storage capacity from 2012 to 2015.  And once that capacity is lost, Sneed says, it's lost for good.  ""You can't undo it. Even if everybody stopped pumping today and we just let the groundwater aquifer systems just recharge, you don't get that subsidence back.""  According to the Arizona State researchers, if California experiences only one drought per decade, the state's aquifers could permanently lose more than a quarter of their storage capacity this century.  And the problems caused by subsidence don't end there.    In the tiny community of Allensworth, about 60 kilometres south of Williams's Hanford farm, no one dares drink from the tap.  Allensworth resident Israel Sanchez walks out of his home tapping a large refillable water bottle, the kind one might see topping an office water cooler. Sanchez says he spends about $200 a month on bottled water.  ""This is what we have to go buying all the time in the town,"" Sanchez says. ""That's how we survive here.""  That's because the water is dangerously polluted with arsenic. Subsidence is kind of like squeezing a sponge: the sinking ground presses contaminants like arsenic out of the soil and into the groundwater.  A recent Stanford study in the journal Nature Communications found that in areas where land sank more than 7.6 cm per year, the risk of finding dangerous levels of arsenic in groundwater tripled.  That study also found that around 10 per cent of wells tested in this agricultural hotspot showed dangerous levels of arsenic.    And just across from Sanchez's house, a cautionary tale: historic Allensworth.  Driving around the small community composed of several homes, a schoolhouse, a church, and a few other simple structures, one might easily get the idea that you were visiting a ghost town.  ""It's never been a ghost town,"" insists Jerelyn Oliveira, an interpreter at the Colonel Allensworth State Historic Park. ""There has actually been a continually operating elementary school here since 1910.""  Oliveira uses her key to open the door of a white house. Inside are pictures of several African-American women: Colonel Allen Allensworth's daughters. This was his house, at the centre of the town he founded. In the early 1900s it was a thriving African-American community. By the 1960s it became an empty tourist attraction.  One of the reasons this town was eventually abandoned, according to Oliveira: arsenic.    She points to a row of trees several hundred metres away.  ""It's hard to believe that's an old lake bed,"" Oliveira says.  Now, even less remains of the lake than of historic Allensworth. So much water was diverted for agricultural use, the lake vanished. And a new problem emerged.  ""Arsenic is something that was already in the land as it's a natural occurring mineral,"" Oliveira says. But with more farmers using the water and the water table not being replenished, she says, ""the concentrations [of arsenic] were going to get higher. And that's what eventually happened…. The community faded. Its wells were deemed unsafe.""    Historic Allensworth provides a dramatic lesson, but it's one California has been slow to learn. It was the last state in the U.S. to adopt a groundwater law. The Sustainable Groundwater Management Act of 2014 requires aquifers to become sustainable, but only by 2040.  With the added threat of more frequent droughts due to climate change, experts like Farr say more needs to be done to recharge the aquifers and curb water use right now, or the ground will keep sinking and the aquifers will keep shrinking.  ""The farmers now are coming to terms with that, and that they may have to pump less,"" Farr says.    But many farmers like Williams say that's not likely unless the state of California builds more reservoirs.  Until then, she says, ""farmers have no choice but to pump it out of the ground. Either that or we don't grow crops, and people need to eat.""  On the land next to hers, you can hear the roar of a huge machine: a giant hydraulic drilling rig. It turns out her neighbour is digging a new well for his farm. It's big. And it's deep.",technology
212,Scotiabank says no risk to customers after bank's software found on coding website,"A Canadian IT consultant is raising the alarm after he says he found some sensitive software code belonging to Scotiabank on a popular online file-sharing repository.  Jason Coulls says he found source codes and access keys for some of the bank's internal systems while searching on GitHub, a popular online tool for software programmers that allows them to share information and collaborate on projects.  The discovery was first reported by British technology website The Register and has since been picked up by various cybersecurity-related publications.  Coulls told CBC News on Friday that he made no attempt to access any of the bank's information once he uncovered the code, but he said it looked as if some of the code he found was used to analyze various payment processing systems.  ""In order to do that it has to access the customer transaction data,"" he said, which means some information such as customer names, account numbers and other identifying information could be accessed.  ""Basically the things they ask for to then do a scam,"" he said. ""That's not good to have that kind of information out there.""  Coulls says the bank has removed most of the files since he brought it to light, but nonetheless information that clearly should not have been public was available in plain sight for months to anyone who knew where to look.  Coulls says he has no idea if the information was used for nefarious purposes — or indeed if the data was old code that no longer would provide access to the bank's network — but he stresses that's it's a problem either way. To show why, he says what the bank has done is akin to leaving a key to a house hidden on a front porch.  ""When they leave the keys out, you can see the keys and you can see the lock, but nobody will know 100 per cent if the key actually works or not,"" or indeed if anyone entered the house, he said in an interview. ""Whether somebody did go in or not we would never know and whether the key would fit the lock also we would not know.""  In a statement to CBC News, the bank said its technical teams were ""working to remove the information"" from the web, but stressed that the data on the bank's 25 million customers is secure.  ""The information that was posted on an online data repository does not contain information that would put our customers, employees and partners at risk,"" the bank said.",technology
146,What you need to know if you have a disability and want to vote,"If you're one of the six million or so Canadians who identify as having at least one disability, there are new tools and services available to help you vote.  Many were developed with the input and experience of an advisory group struck in 2014 specifically to address some of the biggest obstacles people with different abilities face when they go to cast a ballot.  Some of the tools and measures are being used in an election for the first time.  Here's a guide to what's available:  Polling stations  Whether you use a wheelchair or a cane or other form of assistance to get around, you should be able to easily access your polling station. There are specific accessibility criteria laid out by Elections Canada — including some that are mandatory.  For example, if there are stairs, there needs to be a ramp that is wide enough to accommodate a wheelchair or scooter. Doors need to be easy to open. And the actual room where you vote needs to be on the same level as the entrance.   Jewelles Smith, who is part of the Advisory Group for Disability Issues (AGDI), which has been working with Elections Canada, said it goes beyond just being able to get in the polling station door.   For those in a wheelchair, access can mean ""not having things so high that you can't reach to make your mark,"" she said. Making sure your ballot doesn't slip while using the braille reader, or that the pencils are the right size are also important.  ""The pencils were really terrible previously,"" Smith said. The first new batch wasn't much better either. ""So Elections Canada went back, got different pencils, and then we trialled them again.""   The result? Better grip, making the ability to mark the ballot easier. It makes a difference, Smith said.   But it's not just about the tools. It also matters how polling station staff is trained, Smith said. ""Don't assume what somebody needs by looking at them. Ask 'what can I do to assist you to vote?'""  The ballot  The ballot itself has changed since 2015 to accommodate larger text. It's also been optimized to be read by screen readers. And visually impaired Canadians can bring their own communication device or screen reader to use behind the voting screen.   One recommendation of the AGDI was to also put photos of each candidate beside their name. According to Elections Canada, doing so would require a change by Parliament to the Elections Act.   What else is there for people who are visually impaired?  Whether you are voting in advance or on election day, these tools and services are available:     magnifiers with light (4x)   a tactile and braille voting template   large-print lists of candidates   braille lists of candidates (available on election day only)   voting screens that let in more light   large pencils    John Rae, who lives in Toronto and is blind, wants further choices — such as voting by phone or electronically. ""Any of these options would make it possible to vote independently and verify independently in secret.""  Smith said privacy and independence are also important to the AGDI and it continues to push Elections Canada in that direction.   What if I use sign language?  Elections Canada will ensure there is someone who can translate to American Sign Language or Langue des signes québécoise available when you go to vote.  The voter information card that you receive in the mail has information on how to request the service ahead of election day.   Can I bring someone to help me vote?  Yes. Elections Canada allows Canadians to bring someone to the polling station to help them mark their ballot. That can be your spouse, your friend, or your personal support worker. That person is even allowed to help another voter if the need arises.   The assistant needs to be at least 18 years old — but does not even need to be eligible to vote themselves. They simply need to make a solemn declaration that they will respect the secrecy of your vote.  What if I can't get to the polling station?  There is always an option to vote by mail or go to any Elections Canada office before election day to cast a ballot.   And if you live in a long-term care home or a hospital, you can likely vote there. Elections Canada has mobile voting stations, and they can even bring the ballot box from room to room if patients are confined to bed.   But for people who simply can't leave their private home to vote, like Susan Stenson of Red Deer, Alta., there is another, little-known option.   She asked Elections Canada to come to her. After several weeks of back and forth, and help from a local candidate, the agency agreed. They sent a returning officer to Stenson's home and she voted ""with no problem.""  ""There are so many potential voters who don't get to exercise their right because they don't even know they have the right.""   ""I didn't give up.""   That's voting. What about a more accessible campaign?  Smith said there have been a couple of significant changes made for 2019, again, on the recommendation of the AGDI.   Candidates who incur additional costs to make their local events or meetings fully accessible — including providing sign language translation — can have 90 per cent of the costs reimbursed, up to a maximum of $5,000.   ""We also pushed so that more people with disabilities could actually run as candidates,"" Smith said. As a result, Elections Canada will also reimburse any extra costs associated with being a candidate with a disability.  And debates?   The two official debates on Oct. 7 and 8 will have closed captioning, described video, and sign language translation — American Sign Language for the English debate, and Langue des signes québécoise for the French.   But Rae, who is also on the Canadian Council of Canadians for Disabilities, points to a persistent failing. ""We have never to my knowledge had a question about a disability issue asked during the debates."" He's hopeful that, too, will change.     The Accessible Canada Act  Finally, some of our readers have wondered whether this new law will affect elections. Short answer is — maybe.   The Accessible Canada Act was just passed in late June. Before any changes to elections are made because of it, a few things have to happen first.  First, the Canadian Accessibility Standards Development Organization has to be created and the government has to pass regulations establishing standards in the areas covered by the Accessible Canada Act, including Elections Canada.   Once those regulations are law, Elections Canada says it will have one year to prepare a compliance report setting out whether it meets the standards set out in regulation. If it doesn't, it has to come up with a plan to achieve compliance.",politics
139,Singh vows NDP would double natural disaster support fund for communities,"NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh says his government would more than double the disaster mitigation funds provided to communities.   He made the announcement in Gatineau, Que., which has suffered severe flooding and tornadoes in the last few years.   Following a string of natural disasters across the country, the Liberals committed $2 billion over 10 years to help communities. That money in the Disaster Mitigation and Adaptation Fund is used to match the funding of municipalities and provinces.   Under the Liberal plan, local governments must come up with half the cost and only infrastructure projects with a price tag of more than $20 million qualify.     Singh says the NDP would boost that funding to $4.5 billion over four years and lower the threshold to get projects approved, but still ask local governments to provide half the funding.   The money is to help communities respond to extreme weather events, Singh said. But it's also intended to help them get ahead of the damage caused by climate change by adapting their infrastructure to, for example, withstand or divert floods, he said.  ""What we've seen for too long is there's a disaster, and then there's a response,"" he told reporters.   ""And instead of responding after the case, what we're proposing is if we give investments to municipalities right now, they can put in place the infrastructure to avoid this from happening.""    Singh said the NDP is also prepared to work with the provinces and municipalities to address the fears and concerns of homeowners on floodplains.   That initiative would fall under the NDP's wider environmental plan, which would commit $15 billion to lower emissions and protect the environment.",politics
22,How the country's new pipeline dispute could shake up oil business,"Think ""pipeline dispute"" and the mind may conjure up images of environmental protest, pro-oil rallies and bickering politicians.  But there's another kind of dispute simmering over pipelines these days — one that could shake-up the sector for years to come and is dividing opinions in the Canadian oilpatch.   It may also offer an early test of the new Canada Energy Regulator (CER), which replaced the National Energy Board only a few weeks ago.    ""This could be a market-altering event,"" said Jackie Forrest, senior director at the ARC Energy Research Institute.  ""We have to tread very carefully in terms of understanding what the implications of this massive change will be for the industry and the markets.""  At issue is a proposal by Calgary-based Enbridge to revamp its Mainline system, changing how it assigns space on the pipeline network responsible for most of Canada's oil transportation.    For decades, the Mainline has operated as a 100 per cent common carrier.   ""Every month, anyone that wants to ship on the line can say that they want to ship and how much they want to ship and that space gets divvied up,"" Forest said. ""It's open for everyone.""  Enbridge's new proposal is to reduce the common-carrier portion of the Mainline to 10 per cent, while 90 per cent would be designated for companies signed up for longer contracts of up to 20 years.  The company says it's responding to what it's heard from its many stakeholders, including shippers, producers, refiners and marketers in both Canada and the United States.    ""They want to be able access the same services from Enbridge that are currently available on competing pipelines,"" said Guy Jarvis, the company's executive vice president of liquids pipelines.  ""Priority access, toll certainty and the potential to contract for terms of up to 20 years.""  It's not a plan that sits well with everyone, though.  In August, Enbridge announced a two-month ""open season,"" a period when it will accept bids from shippers who want to sign longer-term contracts for priority transport on the Mainline.    This spurred several companies to stake out their opposition, including Suncor, Shell Canada and MEG Energy, as well as the Explorers and Producers Association of Canada (EPAC).  Suncor, the country's largest oil and gas producer by market capitalization, wants the Canada Energy Regulator (CER) to put the brakes on the open-season process.  In its submission to the federal regulator, Suncor says the open season effectively compels shippers to bid for contracted space even if they consider the terms and conditions of service and tolls to be ""unclear, uncertain, inappropriate, unfair or unjust and unreasonable.""    It asks the regulator to declare that Enbridge cannot offer contract carriage, or require binding contracts be signed, until the terms and conditions of the new system, including tolls, receive regulatory approval.  EPAC, whose members represent about 20 per cent of Canadian oil and gas production, is concerned about the timing of the Enbridge proposal when some producers are already facing struggles getting oil to market.  ""There is a severe shortage of pipeline capacity, a high level of apportionment, and no certainty as to future capacity additions,"" association president Tristan Goodman wrote in a submission to the CER.  ""There are no other alternatives for the captured shippers. This puts our members in an untenable position of having to contract for firm service for fear of being blocked out of capacity, and not because it is in their best interest to do so.""  Still, there are other businesses that support a revamp, including oilsands giant Cenovus Energy.    Cenovus told the regulator it believes the changes will provide certainty for shippers moving volumes of oil to downstream markets, which includes refineries.  It also agrees with Enbridge that the regulator should not interrupt the established open-season process, used to gauge whether there is shipper interest in the service.  ""The harm that will arise from upending the established practice will be yet another indication to companies and investors that the regulatory process in Canada is uncertain and may be adjusted on an ad hoc basis,"" Cenovus wrote.    Enbridge fired back in its own submissions it would be ""unjust and unreasonable"" to be required to obtain regulatory approval of its proposed Mainline changes before it had the chance to gauge shipper interest in the service.  No other pipeline in Canada has been required to follow such a process, Enbridge says.  Opponents of the Enbridge proposal hope the CER will make the decision to pause the project in the coming days. But first the regulator's six-member commission may have to decide whether it has the jurisdiction to take such action.  With the open season set to end on Oct. 2, the clock is ticking. It's a decision the industry will be watching closely.",business
60,Federal candidates make pitches to B.C. First Nations at AFN meeting,"Several federal election candidates delivered their pitches to B.C. First Nations leadership at a meeting in Musqueam on Thursday, speaking about their commitments to issues like climate change, Indigenous rights and title and the implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.  Elected leadership and delegates from 58 First Nations at the B.C. Assembly of First Nations' annual general assembly listened to what they can expect from the Green, Liberal and New Democratic parties if elected. A Conservative Party candidate was invited to speak but couldn't attend, according to organizers.  Among the seven candidates who spoke, five were First Nations from communities across the province.     Despite running for different political parties, the speakers' tone was cordial. Two of the seven candidates who spoke are running against each other in the same riding.   ""I'm honoured to sit with some really stellar individuals in spite of the fact we might not share the same worldview,"" said Joan Phillip, New Democratic Party candidate for the Central Okanagan-Similkameen-Nicola riding.  ""I hold you up. I thank you for taking this bold step in wanting to represent us.""  Independent candidates Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott were also in attendance and spoke about what they'll bring to Ottawa if re-elected and where they see First Nations advocacy being crucial in the years to come in areas like on-reserve infrastructure funding and child welfare legislation.     Climate change dominated discussions   Candidates were given five minutes each to talk at the session. A great deal of emphasis was placed on climate change and how addressing its impacts require co-operation and collaboration, and that Indigenous people have a fundamental role to play.   Lydia Hwitsum, running as the Green Party candidate for Cowichan-Malahat-Langford, said ""As Indigenous people close to the land, close to our territories, we feel it first. We see and feel the impact of climate change in terms of our access to our foods and plants and natural world that has sustained us.""    Teegee commended the candidates for speaking at length about climate change, which he said is ""quite frankly the biggest issue,"" not only for North America but the world.  He said he was also encouraged in the commitments he heard about implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.   Candidates asked about Trudeau brownface photos  After each candidate spoke, those in the room were invited to ask questions. The first question redirected the conversation in the room to the photos of Liberal leader Justin Trudeau in brownface that were published in the last 24 hours.     One by one, each of the candidates spoke of their disappointment in Trudeau and many spoke about their own personal experiences with racism.   ""We can't wash the colour of our skin off; this is who we are,"" said Hwitsum.   Bob Chamberlin, NDP candidate for Nanaimo-Ladysmith, said the photos were a reminder that ""racism is alive and well in Canada.""  Phillip said she felt Trudeau's apology rang hollow to her and that ""if he had any integrity whatsoever he would step down.""  Green Party leader Elizabeth May, running for re-election in Saanich-Gulf Islands, said ""I felt physically ill.""    Michelle Corfield, Liberal candidate in the Nanaimo-Ladysmith riding, was the last to respond to the question and started by saying she, too, was disappointed.   ""And then I heard it was 20 years ago,"" she said.  She reflected on who she was, where she was and what she was doing 20 years ago and talked about how her grandmother taught her that people make mistakes and need to be forgiven when they ask for it.   ""What I say today is I hope the country learns a lesson from this and that they take away something that is going to change people… That is my hope because he has asked for forgiveness, he has said sorry. It is now time for us as a country to look at that and take something from it.""  The annual general assembly runs until Friday.",politics
90,CannTrust says Health Canada has suspended its cannabis licence,"CannTrust Holdings Inc. says it received a notice of licence suspension from Health Canada, which has been investigating the cannabis company for allegedly cultivating pot in unlicensed rooms.  The Vaughan, Ont.-based company says the notice it received from the regulator on Tuesday indicates that Health Canada has suspended its authority to produce cannabis — other than cultivating and harvesting — and to sell cannabis.  The company says it is facing a partial suspension of its licences for standard cultivation and a full suspension of its licences for standard processing, medical sales, cannabis drugs and research.  However, CannTrust will be permitted to cultivate and harvest existing lots or batches that were previously grown and conduct ancillary activities in connection with them. But it cannot propagate new lots or batches or sell or distribute cannabis.  CannTrust had previously halted all sales and shipments of cannabis as Health Canada continued its probe, and both the company and the regulator have put on hold a total of 12,700 kilograms of cannabis products.  The notice states that Health Canada will reinstate CannTrust's licences under section 64(4) of the Cannabis Act if the company demonstrates that the suspension was unfounded or if the reasons for the suspension no longer exist.  It also states that CannTrust could address the public health and safety risks by:     Ensuring its cannabis is produced and distributed only as licensed, including measures to control the movement of cannabis in and out of CannTrust's site.   Recovering cannabis that was not authorized by CannTrust's licence.   Improving key personnel's knowledge of and compliance with the provisions of the Cannabis Act and other regulations that apply to the company.

195,"Any province could veto a major pipeline under an NDP government, says Singh","An NDP government would grant all provinces veto power over national infrastructure projects that cross their borders, says NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh.  The declaration came after Singh unveiled his party's Quebec platform, which would grant that province veto power over infrastructure projects on its territory, including pipelines.  ""I would not impose a project on any province and that means there has to be social acceptability,"" said Singh in an interview with host Vassy Kapelos on CBC News Network's Power &amp; Politics, set to air Monday night.  ""I mean, it should be the fact if we want to move forward with a project, there has to be the buy-in from all the people involved.""    The NDP's Quebec platform states that projects ""cannot bypass Quebec's environmental laws and cannot proceed without the agreement of the Government and people of Quebec.""  Quebec Premier Francois Legault has said he is opposed to any cross-Canada oil pipeline project that would be built through Quebec, arguing there is ""no social acceptability"" for an additional pipeline through the province.    Singh told Power &amp; Politics that if a government led by him failed to build consensus among provinces affected by a project, the project wouldn't proceed.  When asked if that policy would diminish the federal government's power to designate certain projects as serving the national interest, Singh said that the ""national interest has to coincide with making the efforts to have people that are impacted believe in the project.""    ""But that's kind of the beauty of federalism, that it's not something that should be where we're imposing decisions, where we work and provide an advantage, provide investments, show people that this is going to be to their benefit and, if that can be done, then it should be a project that goes ahead,"" added Singh.  The federal government has the constitutional authority to impose national infrastructure projects on provinces, including pipelines.    Interpreting Section 35 of the Constitution, the Supreme Court of Canada has ruled that while the federal government has a duty to consult affected Indigenous communities about infrastructure projects, that duty does not amount to a veto power for Indigenous peoples.

86,"U.S. abortion rate at lowest level since Roe v. Wade ruling, according to report","The number and rate of abortions across the United States have plunged to their lowest levels since the procedure became legal across the country in 1973, according to new figures released Wednesday.  The report from the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that says it works to advance sexual and reproductive health and rights, counted 862,000 of the procedures in the U.S. in 2017. That's down from 926,000 tallied in the group's 2014 report and from just over one million in 2011.  Guttmacher, a non-profit, is the only entity that strives to count all abortions in the U.S., making inquiries of individual providers. Federal data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention excludes California, Maryland and New Hampshire.  The new report illustrates that abortions are decreasing in all parts of the country, whether in Republican-controlled states seeking to restrict abortion access or in Democratic-run states protecting abortion rights. Between 2011 and 2017, abortion rates increased in only five states and the District of Columbia.  One reason for the drop in the number of abortions is the declining birth rate. The Guttmacher Institute noted the birth rate, as well as the abortion rate, dropped during the years covered by the new report. A likely factor, the report said, is increased accessibility of contraception since 2011, as the Affordable Care Act required most private health insurance plans to cover contraceptives without out-of-pocket costs.  Abortion pill increased since last report  According to the report, the 2017 abortion rate was 13.5 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-44 — the lowest rate since the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion. Following that ruling, the number in the U.S. rose steadily — peaking at 1.6 million in 1990 before starting a steady, still-continuing decline. The abortion rate is now less than half what is was in 1990.  Guttmacher noted that almost 400 state laws restricting abortion access were enacted between 2011 and 2017, but said these laws were not the main force behind the overall decline in abortions. It said 57 per cent of the nationwide decline occurred in the 18 states, plus the District of Columbia, that did not enact any new restrictions.    Between 2011 and 2017, the number of clinics providing abortion in the U.S. declined from 839 to 808, with significant regional disparities, the report said. The South had a decline of 50 clinics, including 25 in Texas, and the Midwest had a decline of 33 clinics, including nine each in Iowa, Michigan and Ohio. By contrast, the Northeast added 59 clinics, mostly in New Jersey and New York.  Over that period, the abortion rate dropped in Ohio by 27 per cent and in Texas by 30 per cent, but the rate dropped by similar amounts in states that protected abortion access, including California, Hawaii and New Hampshire.  Areas with the highest abortion rates in 2017 were the District of Columbia, New Jersey, New York, Maryland and Florida. Rates were lowest in Wyoming, South Dakota, Kentucky, Idaho and Missouri — many women from those five states go out of state to obtain abortions.  One significant trend documented in the report: those undergoing abortions are increasingly relying on medication rather than surgery. Medication abortion, making use of the so-called abortion pill, accounted for 39 per cent of all abortions in 2017, up from 29 per cent in 2014.  Impact of most recent laws not yet clear  The report, which focuses on data from 2017, does not chronicle the flurry of sweeping abortion bans enacted earlier this year in several Republican-controlled states, including a near-total ban in Alabama and five bills that would ban abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected, as early as six weeks into pregnancy. None of those bans has taken effect; their backers hope that litigation over the laws might eventually lead to a Supreme Court ruling weakening or overturning Roe v. Wade.  Guttmacher's president, Dr. Herminia Palacio, said abortion restrictions, regardless of whether they lead to fewer abortions, ""are coercive and cruel by design,"" with a disproportionate impact on low-income women.  However, the push for tougher restrictions continues. Just last week, Texas Right to Life and some allied groups urged Gov. Greg Abbott to call a special session of the legislature to ""abolish every remaining elective abortion"" in the state.  The report comes amid upheaval in the federal family planning program, known as Title X. About one in five family planning clinics has left the program, objecting to a Trump administration regulation that bars them from referring women for abortions. Title X clinics provide birth control and basic health services for low-income women.  ""If your priority is to reduce abortions, one of the best things you can do is make sure that women have access to high-quality, affordable and effective methods of birth control,"" said Alina Salganicoff, director of women's health policy for the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.",health
43,B.C. says it hasn't 'consented' to $900M military sexual assault settlement,"British Columbia wants a say in the federal government's proposed $900 million class action lawsuit settlement with hundreds of current and former members of the Canadian military who allege they were the victims of rampant sexual misconduct.  The province's attorney general has written to the Federal Court asking for standing in the case as a judge this week hears submissions for and against the proposed settlement.  The federal government has approached all of the provinces asking them for a waiver abandoning any claim for federal compensation for the cost of providing health care to the alleged victims.  ""The province has not agreed to waive its claim and has not consented to the proposed settlement,"" said the letter from the office of B.C. Attorney General David Eby, dated Sept. 13.  The judge plans a separate hearing to deal with Eby's request for standing and other logistical matters related to the proposed settlement.    Eby's letter, filed with the court this week, suggested that both Ontario and Nova Scotia harbour similar reservations about being unable to recover from the federal government health care costs related to the alleged misconduct of soldiers, sailors and aircrew.  Lawyers representing the hundreds of alleged victims would not comment on the letter or its potential impact on the case, saying they'll wait to see what arguments the province makes before Justice Simon Fothergill.  The settlement was announced last summer, with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau holding it up as a sign that the Liberal government takes seriously claims of sexual misconduct in the military. The federal government does not admit liability in the case.  Out of the $900 million set aside by Ottawa for the settlement, $800 million will go toward paying the claims of current and former members of the Canadian Armed Forces. An additional $100 million will be used to settle with civilian employees of the Department of National Defence who say they experienced sexual harassment, sexual assault or discrimination based on sex, gender, gender identity or sexual orientation on the job.  Members of the class action will be eligible for individual compensation sums of between $5,000 and $55,000, depending on the circumstances of their cases.  Those who experienced ""exceptional harm"" and were previously denied benefits could be eligible for up to $155,000 each.    In a statement issued when the settlement was announced, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan said ""no one should feel unsafe at work"" and ""it takes a lot of courage to come forward and share difficult and painful experiences and press for change.""  Over the past two days, the judge has heard harrowing personal accounts from the alleged victims, who are both male and female.  'I'm broken'  Some of the harassment cases and alleged crimes date back decades, but many are more recent. Some allegedly happened over the last few years.  ""I'm broken,"" one former female officer told court today. She said her assault was reported to the military police and the subsequent investigation interviewed only friends of the accused. (CBC News does not report the names of alleged sexual assault victims.)  Another woman, a member of the air force, spoke about being drugged in an officer's mess and raped in a barracks in 2010. On that night, she told the judge, a predator stole her sense of security from her.  ""To this day, I don't know who did it. Charges were never laid. There was no hearing and no verdict,"" said the woman, who is no longer in the military.  ""When news of the class action lawsuit reached me, I initially felt as if this could be my chance at attaining a small measure of justice.""    She said the settlement, which she favours, represents validation for what she and others endured.  ""It is impossible to erase the damage caused by the trauma and the systemic betrayal of trust, but if this settlement can begin to lift those wounded soldiers up, then it has my full support,"" she said.  Others told the judge that more needs to be done within the military to screen out sexual predators.  During the last four years, the Canadian military has waged a high-profile campaign to stamp out sexual misconduct and assault within the ranks.  Some of the alleged victims who spoke on Friday are still serving members; they told the judge that the policy has had limited success and the military's macho culture is deeply ingrained.",politics
148,Former Liberal adviser rips party over racial insensitivity in government ranks,"A former adviser in the Liberal government said he wasn't surprised by photos of Justin Trudeau in blackface makeup because he encountered racially insensitive behaviour while working in the upper ranks of his government.  Omer Aziz said the photos of Trudeau are of a piece with behaviour he saw while working on Parliament Hill with Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland's policy team. According to his Linked In profile, Aziz held the job for seven months. He quit in 2018.  ""Sometimes a slip of the tongue is not just a slip of the tongue. It's a slip of the mask,"" he said in an interview with CBC Radio's The House airing today.  ""I basically had to leave my dream job because of racist prejudices that went unacknowledged.""  Aziz said that while he worked in the department, he heard staffers referring to certain communities as ""ethnic vote banks."" He said he was assigned to ""brown files"" in the department — files dealing with non-white-majority countries — and said he was subjected to ""whitesplaining"" by colleagues who assumed he wasn't aware of certain cultural nuances because of his skin colour.    Trudeau has been forced to answer uncomfortable questions all week after three instances of him wearing brownface or blackface as part of various costumes surfaced in the media.  The images span about a decade and a variety of situations, and show Trudeau in blackface both as a teenager and as an adult.  ""What I did was inexcusable and wrong and hurt a lot of people who considered me to be an ally and that was wrong. And I am deeply, deeply sorry,"" Trudeau told a crowd in Saskatchewan Thursday.  Trudeau has now publicly apologized twice — but he also has repeatedly declined to state how many times he may have worn blackface. He said he was ""wary of being definitive about this because of the recent pictures that came out, I had not remembered.""  Aziz said almost all of his colleagues in the federal government were white and seemed unaware of subtle racist behaviour in the workplace.  ""People in power above me were blind to what I was seeing,"" he said.  ""I felt like (...) I was a character from the movie Get Out, where my reality was kind of warped and distorted. Obviously people are never racist to your face.""    CBC News's requests for comment from the Prime Minister's Office and Freeland's office were forwarded to the Liberal Party.  ""When hiring exempt staff across government, the aim is always to identify high-quality candidates that reflect the diversity of Canada and to build more inclusive work environments,"" the party statement reads.  Aziz said he tried to share his concerns with Gerry Butts, then the principal secretary to the prime minister, but was ultimately unable to meet with him.  The India trip  Aziz said his decision to leave the Liberal government permitted him to dodge a bullet: he believes he would have been involved in organizing Trudeau's early 2018 trip to India.  The trip turned into a colossal PR disaster for the prime minister after news emerged that a Sikh extremist had been invited to a reception at the Canadian High Commissioner's residence — and after he was roundly mocked for appearing in traditional Indian dress.  ""The India trip was brownface without the makeup,"" Aziz said.  As for the blackface images, Aziz wondered aloud how everyone managed ""to miss this for 18 years.""    Aziz said voters can still count on the Liberals to be progressive in areas like climate change and the economy — but they shouldn't assume Trudeau ""at every instance has been on the side of minorities and the powerless.""  ""Don't have any illusions and still pretend that this is a saviour ... It's not true,"" he said.  Trudeau also responded to questions about how voters should analyze his actions.  ""I certainly hope that they will continue to support us in the work that we're doing, but they might not,"" he said at a media event in Winnipeg Thursday. ""And I know that is something that all Canadians get to decide and they get to bring in all sorts of different factors, because every Canadian has a different way of looking at what matters to them.""  If the Liberals form government again, Aziz said he wants to see changes made at the top.  ""One thing I'm going to be looking forward to is if they are re-elected, do they diversify at the top, because I'm kind of tired of hearing about people talking about diversity when everyone around them looks the same.""",politics
166,All GM's vehicle assembly workers in Oshawa laid off because of U.S. strike,"The strike by 49,000 United Auto Workers (UAW) against General Motors in the United States has led to more temporary job losses at GM's assembly plant in Oshawa, Ont.  On Friday, GM issued a statement saying vehicle production at Oshawa has stopped, though there are stamping operations in that facility that continue.  The truck assembly line in Oshawa sent home 1,200 workers on Wednesday, as the line ran out of parts.  On Friday, the line that makes Chevrolet Impalas and Cadillacs was halted, leaving about 2,000 workers in total on temporary layoff. Only 75 employees, in the stamping operations, remain on the job at the Oshawa facility.  ""We plan to resume these operations as quickly as possible upon resolution of the UAW strike,"" GM spokesperson Jennifer Wright said in a statement.    Workers will be paid during the temporary layoffs, according to Unifor, the union for the Canadian workers. GM has scheduled the Oshawa line to close at the end of the year.  North American auto assembly is highly integrated, with plants in Canada reliant on parts coming from the U.S. and Mexico. The UAW strike has stopped production at more than 50 GM plants and warehouses in the U.S.  GM Canada also makes engines in St. Catharines, Ont., as well as the Chevrolet Equinox SUV in Ingersoll, Ont.   More layoffs could come  Jerry Dias, president of Unifor, said workers in St. Catharines could face layoffs soon, since about 80 per cent of the engines the plant builds are destined for cars assembled in the U.S. About 700 workers in St. Catharines, or two-thirds of the workforce, could be affected as soon as Monday.  At the Ingersoll CAMI assembly plant, about half the engines they put in cars come from the U.S. That plant is expected to run all next week, but may face shutdowns after that, unless the strike is settled.  In addition, at least 1,700 workers are affected at auto parts makers in Ontario that supply GM.  ""We have about 1,700 members working directly with suppliers that are affected as of right now,"" said Colin James, president of Unifor Local 222, which represents the Oshawa workers.  ""It's tough on those members, and they're looking to get back to work as soon as possible, but with the U.S. strike, nobody knows how long they'll be out,"" said James.  On Thursday, UAW vice-president Terry Dittes said progress was being made in the GM talks, though many issues remain unresolved.   Meanwhile, details are becoming clearer on GM's offer to invest $7 billion US in U.S. facilities, an offer made on the eve of the strike that began Monday.  The UAW is concerned with GM's plan to shut four U.S. plants and its lack of new investment in the U.S.  The new offer is to include $2 billion from joint ventures and suppliers for new plants that would pay workers less than the top union wage, a person briefed on the matter said.  Details emerge about GM offer  Those factories would not be run as typical GM plants. Although workers at those facilities would be represented by the UAW, they would be paid far less than the full UAW wage of about $30 per hour.  On Sunday, GM made part of the offer public, saying that its investment included 5,400 jobs, the majority of them new hires. But the person briefed on the talks said only about 2,700 new jobs will be added. The rest are jobs that would be retained because of the investments.  GM said it would invest in eight facilities in four states, introduce new electric trucks, make wage or lump sum payment increases and give each worker an $8,000 bonus once the deal is ratified.    CEO Mary Barra has predicted an ""all-electric future"" for GM, meaning jobs making gas-powered cars could be in jeopardy.  The person said union negotiators were disappointed after the company briefed them on details Wednesday. Further details were not available.",business
59,"In Quebec, Trudeau's opponents and supporters shrug off blackface controversy","Quebec had been the epicentre of debates about identity politics so far in the federal election campaign, with party leaders forced to confront to the popularity of a new law on religious symbols.  But the campaign shifted focus abruptly on Thursday, after photos and video emerged of Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau wearing racist makeup. The desire to talk identity politics in the province evaporated just as quickly.   Even though Trudeau's criticism of Quebec's secularism law has been controversial in the province, none of his usual opponents on the issue were itching to rake him over the coals.   ""I can understand that some people were hurt by these pictures. But Mr. Trudeau said that he was sorry. I think we have to talk about something else,"" said Premier François Legault, who has clashed with Trudeau over the law, also known as Bill 21.  The leader of the sovereignist Parti Québécois, Pascal Bérubé, went so far as to play down the condemnations issued by Trudeau's federal rivals.  ""It's a political campaign. They want to make sure that Mr. Trudeau pays for that,"" Bérubé told reporters in Quebec City. ""You can disagree with him on many issues, that's my case, but he's not a racist.""    Support holds steady in Trudeau's riding  Outside the bubble of professional politics, few voters indicated to CBCu002FRadio-Canada they would change their vote based on the images of Trudeau appearing in blackface.  In a predominantly Haitian neighborhood in north-end Montreal, which Trudeau has represented as an MP since 2008, his years-long involvement with the community appeared to have bought him a fair degree of goodwill.    CBC News and Radio-Canada reporters interviewed more than a dozen voters in the riding of Papineau on Thursday. All but one said they would still vote for Trudeau.  Seth Atoapoma, 28, said he was divided over whether to feel angry at the nearly 20 year-old photograph of the prime minister dressed in blackface. ""I am black, so the blackface issue is something I do care about. But then again it's 2019.""  Atoapoma, who works in a hair salon in the riding, added: ""I find him a good prime minister. I'm still voting for him. He does do a lot for us.""      In a statement issued Thursday afternoon, the Black Coalition of Quebec said Trudeau's government had proven itself an ally on several issues central to the black community.  ""Those who criticize Justin Trudeau are swimming in a pool of hypocrisy because they haven't done anything to promote black or cultural communities,"" the statement said.  Even outside Montreal, where Liberal support is weaker, few voters seemed inclined to vote against Trudeau because of the images.    In Saint-Hyacinthe, about 65 kilometres east of Montreal, none of the four locals interviewed by a CBC News reporter said the controversy would affect their ballot.   ""I don't think that is important. I think people should talk about something else,"" said Yves Brouillette, an undecided voter.   ""I think that happened 20 years ago. It was a mistake. But who doesn't make mistakes in life?""  Only passing interest in French newspapers  The French media in Quebec also shrugged off Wednesday night's revelations that Trudeau had dressed in blackface once in high school and again in 2001 while a teacher at a private school in British Columbia. A third image of him in blackface surfaced in video form Thursday.  Unlike in English Canada, few French newspapers gave prominent coverage to the images.  In Quebec City, Wednesday's Céline Dion concert was featured more prominently on the Thursday front pages of the local papers.    Le Nouvelliste, a tabloid that serves the electorally strategic district of Trois-Rivières, ran a story about the pictures on page 32.  The main political story on the front page of Montreal's Le Devoir was about Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer's proposal to build an oil pipeline through the province, and the possibility he could ignore Quebec's objections to such a project.  One Journal de Montreal columnist, Richard Martineau, did put the screws to Trudeau. But Martineau, who is often critical of multiculturalism and dismissive of minority groups, seemed mainly interested in accusing Trudeau of hypocrisy, not racism.    On the popular Montreal morning radio show Puisqu il faut se lever, host Paul Arcand and contributor Lise Ravary were more scandalized by the placement of Trudeau's right hand on a woman's chest in the 2001 picture from West Point Grey Academy showing the future prime minister wearing dark makeup as part of an Arabian Nights-themed costume.  ""Let's be clear, it's not far from her cleavage,"" Ravary said.",politics
238,Jeopardy host Alex Trebek resumes chemotherapy treatments,"Jeopardy host Alex Trebek says he has had a setback and is undergoing chemotherapy again for pancreatic cancer.  The Canadian-born game-show host said that after a short period of optimism when he stopped chemotherapy and began immunotherapy, his ""numbers shot up,"" he told ABC's Good Morning America on Tuesday    ""I was doing so well. And my numbers went down to the equivalent of a normal human being who does not have pancreatic cancer, so we were all very optimistic. And they said, 'Good, we're gonna stop chemo. We'll start you on immunotherapy,'"" he said.  ""I lost about 12 pounds in a week and my numbers went sky high, much higher than they were when I was first diagnosed. So, the doctors have decided that I have to undergo chemo again and that's what I'm doing.""  Doctors regularly monitor a cancer patient's blood cell counts to determine how his or her body is handling the particular treatment.   Trebek said his goals for the summer were to get his strength and hair back, and his progress on both fronts was ""dismal.""    The 79-year-old announced in March he had Stage 4 pancreatic cancer. He received an outpouring of support from fans, including from Canadians.  Despite the diagnosis, he hasn't missed a day on the show, which tapes its episodes in advance.      In late August, in a video teasing the forthcoming Jeopardy season, the show released a video in which the Sudbury, Ont.-born host declared: ""I'm on the mend and that's all I can hope for right now.""",entertainment
44,"Liberals promise to prohibit semi-automatic assault rifles, allow cities to ban handguns","Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau says a re-elected Liberal government would ban semi-automatic assault weapons and enable municipalities to restrict or prohibit handguns.  Trudeau made the announcement in Toronto's Greektown, the site of a deadly gun rampage last summer.  Faisal Hussain walked through the Danforth neighbourhood on July 22, 2018, shooting at people on the street, on patios and in restaurants.  He killed 10-year-old Julianna Kozis and 18-year-old Reese Fallon. Thirteen others were injured. Hussain, 29, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head after a gunfight with police.  ""People are dying. Families are grieving. Communities are suffering,"" Trudeau said, with 20 Liberal candidates standing behind him. ""So we're going to do more and we're going to do better. Thoughts and prayers are just not going to cut it. The choice could not be clearer: Liberals are for tougher gun laws, Conservatives are for weaker gun laws.""  Trudeau said a re-elected Liberal government would work with the provinces and territories to give municipalities the ability to further restrict – or ban – handguns.  Background materials from the Liberal Party said the semi-automatic assault rifle ban will include the AR-15, a weapon the party says is ""specifically designed to inflict mass human casualties and [has] no place in Canadian society.""  Fully automatic assault weapons are already banned in Canada.    A Liberal government also would create a buyback program for all semi-automatic assault rifles that were legally purchased, offering owners a fair market price for their weapons and giving law enforcement agencies resources to administer the program. A two-year amnesty would be put in place while the program is being set up.  Bill Blair, who served as the government's pointman on gun control, said there are about 250,000 of the weapons now legally owned, with an average value of about $1,500 each. The buyback program is expected to cost between $400 million and $600 million, he said.  Gun-maker Colt announced Thursday the company is suspending its production of rifles for the civilian market, including the popular AR-15. It said the shift is due to changes in consumer demand and a market already saturated with similar weapons.    No costing details were provided for the campaign promise; the party says that more information will be released ""over the course of the campaign.""  No costing provided  The federal Liberals are being accused by their rivals of keeping voters in the dark about the cost of their campaign promises. While the Conservatives and New Democrats have had their platforms costed by the Parliamentary Budget Office and publicly released, the Liberals have so far neglected to release PBO estimates for the nearly $4 billion worth of campaign promises they've made so far.  The Liberal gun control platform also promises to:     Prevent people suspected of posing a danger to themselves or others, including their partners or children, from possessing or acquiring new firearms.   Require that everyone importing ammunition show proof of a valid firearms licence.   Strengthen safe-storage laws to make it harder for legal weapons to fall into the hands of criminals.   Not bring back the long-gun registry.    Toronto Mayor John Tory, whose city has been reeling from eruptions of gun violence, has been calling for a national handgun ban for more than a year, but in August he said he would be happy with a city-wide ban.  ""It is a step in the right direction toward tougher gun control,"" he said Friday afternoon in response to the Liberal proposal.  Asked if he thinks Ontario Premier Doug Ford might try to block such a ban, Tory said the two politicians have a common interest in ""saving lives.""  He called on the next federal government to take action and make heavy investments to stop the smuggling of handguns from the U.S. into Canada.  Tony Bernardo, executive director of the Canadian Shooting Sports Association, said it is ""disappointing but typical"" for the Liberals to ""attack"" lawful firearms owners whenever they get into trouble.  ""Canada's firearms community is the go-to whipping boy of the Liberal Party, guaranteed to deflect attention away from the latest Liberal scandals,"" he said in a statement to CBC.  ""Trudeau's announcement raises more questions than answers. The Liberals have been unable to define what a military-style assault weapon is, or their role within crime.  ""Trudeau's hyperbolic rhetoric is purely designed to whip up public sentiment against our community and deflect from his own electoral problems, despite the statistical evidence that firearms owners are the most law-abiding people in our country ... and apparently unrepresented by the Liberal Party of Canada.""  Mixed reaction from gun control group  Heidi Rathjen, coordinator of the pro-gun control group Poly Remembers, had a mixed reaction to the Liberal promises, which she called long overdue.  She praised the semi-automatic rifle ban as ""great news, full stop,"" and praised the buyback program.  ""Canadians will be better protected against the risks associated with weapons specifically designed to kill humans rapidly and effectively,"" she said.  But Rathjen said she is disappointed by the plan to hand over to municipalities the responsibility for banning handguns, calling it inadequate and inefficient.    ""All one has to do is look at the glaring disaster south of the border resulting from a patchwork of state and local gun laws, where handguns easily transit from one jurisdiction to another, to see how misguided this approach is,"" she said in a statement.  ""This would also a guarantee protracted and contentious political battle in any municipality that considers further restrictions on handguns, and we doubt there is much appetite in municipalities to face off against the gun lobby when the federal government is clearly unwilling to do so, at least on the issue of handguns.""  The policy differences between the Liberals and Conservatives on guns are stark.  In a radio interview in Kitchener earlier this week, Trudeau accused Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer of ""being in the pocket"" of the gun lobby.  During an event in Saint John today, Scheer called that a ""ridiculous accusation"" made by a leader mired in scandal and desperate to change the channel.  Very different party positions  ""Our plan goes after the real criminals. We're going after illegal firearms, we're standing up for honest Canadians, farmers and hunters, people who use firearms responsibly and legally,"" he said.  ""It's easy to ask law-abiding Canadians to follow more laws. It's harder to go after the criminals and illegal firearms. Conservatives are ready to do the hard work that will actually improve safety in our communities.""",politics
233,Trudeau absent from Lilly Singh's prime-time special,"A group of stars joined late-night newcomer Lilly Singh for a prime-time TV special Wednesday night, but one special guest touted in advance — Canadian Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau — was missing.  Singh kicked off her debut as the sole female host of a main U.S. network late-night show, NBC's A Little Late with Lilly Singh, on Monday.   On Wednesday, NBC celebrated the crossover YouTuber star's debut week with a prime-time special featuring appearances by actors Mandy Moore, Milo Ventimiglia and Tony Hale, singer Christina Aguilera and comedian Kenan Thompson. Pop rock band 5 Seconds of Summer delivered a musical performance.  Earlier this week, however, in promotional material, NBC had also listed Trudeau as an expected guest.    The special aired late Wednesday evening, hours after news emerged Trudeau had appeared in brownface at a 2001 gala at the private school in Vancouver where he was teaching at the time.    In an apology issued Wednesday night, Trudeau admitted he had also performed in blackface for a talent show in high school in Montreal.  A representative from NBC Entertainment told CBC News they made a ""quick decision"" to remove the ""very short pre-taped segment of Justin Trudeau's appearance on Lilly's show."" The representative also confirmed there are no plans to air the segment in the future.   In her monologue for her Wednesday night episode, Singh mocked consumer brands for selling problematic products, including fashion designs that evoke blackface.  Trudeau has previously cheered Singh on via social media, most recently on Monday when he posted a good-luck message to the Toronto-born performer.",entertainment
81,Novartis halts distribution of Zantac drug amid probe into impurities,"Novartis AG's Sandoz unit said Wednesday it was halting distribution of its versions of the ranitidine drug known as Zantac in all its markets, including the United States and Canada, after contaminants were found in the heartburn drug.  The Swiss drugmaker's decision follows an investigation by U.S. and European regulators into the presence of the impurity, N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), in the ranitidine drug and a distribution halt in Canada announced late Tuesday.  ""Current evidence suggests that NDMA may be present in ranitidine, regardless of the manufacturer. As a result, and at Health Canada's request, companies marketing ranitidine products in Canada have stopped any further distribution until evidence is provided to demonstrate that they do not contain NDMA above acceptable levels,"" the regulator said.   Health Canada said the stop distribution request is an interim precautionary measure as it gathers more information and consults with international health regulators.  Branded versions of the drug such as Sanofi SA's Zantac are available for over-the-counter (OTC) sale in Canada, while generic versions are available for sale both OTC and with prescription.    Precautionary measure  Over-the-counter ranitidine is approved to prevent and relieve heartburn associated with acid indigestion and sour stomach. The prescription versions are used to reduce stomach acid to prevent and treat conditions, such as heartburn, ulcers of the stomach and intestines, and gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD, Health Canada said.   A distribution halt is different from a recall and means that existing stock of the drugs in pharmacies or stores can still be sold.  NDMA is classified as a probable human carcinogen, meaning long-term exposure to levels above what is considered safe could increase the risk of cancer.   Health Canada advised consumers:     Talk to your doctor or pharmacist at your earliest convenience about alternative, non-ranitidine treatment options appropriate for your health circumstances.    Individuals taking a prescription ranitidine drug, including a recalled product, should not stop taking it unless they have spoken to their health-care provider and obtained alternative treatment, as the risk of not treating the condition may be greater than the risk related to NDMA exposure.    Similarly, neither the U.S. Food and Drug Administration nor the European Medicines Agency had asked patients to stop taking the drug when the regulators said last week they were reviewing the safety of ranitidine.  Novartis said in an emailed statement its step was precautionary and adequate measures ""will be implemented in alignment with relevant health authorities as required.""  Ranitidine works by blocking the action of acid-producing cells in the stomach.   Last year, Health Canada announced recalls of some heart and high-blood pressure medications because of concerns surrounding the same impurity.",health
62,Brownface photo challenges Trudeau to prove who he really is,"Who is the real Mr. Trudeau?  The photo of Justin Trudeau wearing brownface at an event in 2001 had only just been published by Time magazine when Jagmeet Singh, upon finishing an event in Toronto, was asked for comment. And so the NDP leader, the first racialized Canadian ever to lead a federal party, was forced to come up with a response without having seen the image and before he could consult with his advisers.  After pausing for a few seconds to consider his response, Singh called the image (or at least the idea of it) ""troubling"" and ""insulting."" Then, he hit upon the question that may now weigh on Justin Trudeau for the next four weeks.  ""We see one Mr. Trudeau in public, that seems — I'll be honest with you, seems really nice, right? Very friendly, very warm in public. But behind closed doors he seems like he's a different Mr. Trudeau,"" Singh said, invoking Trudeau's curt dismissal of two Grassy Narrows protesters at a Liberal fundraiser in March. ""Who is the real Mr. Trudeau?""  There is no excuse for brownface. An event entitled ""Arabian Nights"" seems like a relic of the past, but there is no solace in this having been a different time. A white person donning brownface or blackface was never not wrong.  ""I shouldn't have done that. I should have known better, but I didn't and I'm really sorry,"" Trudeau said when he appeared before the cameras onboard the Liberal campaign plane. ""It was something that I didn't think was racist at the time, but now I recognize it was something racist to do and I am deeply sorry.""  That will surely not be enough. If there is any getting past this, Trudeau will have to do more. But he was at least wise enough to begin without equivocation.    The photo surely would have ended Trudeau's political ambitions if it had emerged during the 2015 campaign. The knock then was that he ""just wasn't ready,"" that he was callow and lacked seriousness. He was an unproven candidate applying for a job. This would have been enough to rule him out.  In the midst of the 2019 campaign, Trudeau can only hope that he has shown enough over the last four years to render the photo something less than a defining mistake.    Jarring image  It would be shocking to see any modern political leader in such a costume. But it is perhaps particularly jarring to see Trudeau, a leader who has made diversity and acceptance central elements of his message and appeal.  It was a theme when he launched his campaign for the Liberal leadership in 2012 and he held fast to it as nationalism and xenophobia roiled politics across the Western world.    The man who dressed up in brownface in 2001 went on to loudly condemn the Harper government's move to ban the niqab during the swearing of the citizenship oath and proudly embrace refugees from Syria. He and his government supported a parliamentary study of Islamophobia, launched a federal anti-racism strategy and funded a new ""Centre for Gender, Diversity and Inclusion Statistics.""  Five months ago, Trudeau stood in the House of Commons and delivered a strident speech on the threat of white supremacy.  All that could now come with a significant and prominent asterisk.  Singh: 'A lot of hurt'  Trudeau will be asked whether the photo from 2001 had occurred to him at all over the last 18 years and he will be asked to square this with his party's criticism of Conservatives for their past mistakes. But more important might be how he accounts for his own. While Trudeau apologized Wednesday evening, he did not consider aloud the hurt he may have caused.  ""Seeing this image is gonna be hard for a lot of people, it's going to bring up a lot of pain,"" Singh said in a second appearance on Wednesday night, after he had seen the photo. ""It's going to bring up a lot of hurt.""    Trudeau's connection to the public and his willingness to show compassion and emotion are among his most distinctive traits as a leader. He now needs to acknowledge the impact his actions may have on others, and to do that directly and in person with racialized Canadians and community leaders. He will also need to listen.  And ideally, it will be the voices of racialized Canadians that come to the fore.  All the while, Trudeau will have to continue campaigning for a second term, a task that he has already made harder for himself with unforced errors.    Near the end of his appearance before the cameras on Wednesday night, Trudeau was asked what he would be reflecting about the next few days.  ""I'm going to be thinking about how much harder I'm going to have to continue to work to demonstrate to Canadians that I'm focused on building a better world with less discrimination, less intolerance and less racism,"" he said.  The next four weeks will be about who the real Mr. Trudeau is and whether he is the right choice to lead this country.",politics
74,GM and UAW union making progress as strike enters third day,"Union and company bargainers are making progress toward a new contract as a strike by United Auto Workers that brought 33 General Motors factories to a halt continued into its third day.  Committees working on thorny issues such as wages, health insurance costs, use of temporary workers, and new work for plants slated to close worked until early evening Tuesday and are scheduled to resume bargaining early Wednesday.  UAW spokesman Brian Rothenberg said the talks were moving slowly but progressing.  Cost cutting a factor  More than 49,000 workers walked off their jobs on Monday in a dispute over the union's quest to get a bigger share of GM's profits and the company's goal of cutting labour costs so they're closer to those at U.S. auto plants run by foreign companies.  Health care costs and giving temporary workers a clear path to permanent jobs were two major sticking points in talks toward a new four-year contract.  On the picket lines, many workers were hoping for a quick resolution, but said they're willing to stay out as long as needed.  ""I can't see this lasting too long,"" said machinist Clarence Trinity as he carried a union sign at GM's engine and transmission factory in the Detroit suburb of Romulus, Michigan. ""Both sides are losing bad.""  Citi analyst Itay Michaeli, in a note to investors, estimated that the strike is costing the company $100 million per day in earnings. However, GM has enough inventory to supply dealers for 77 days at the current sales pace, although it's running lower on big SUVs, according to Cox Automotive.  1 week tipping point  If the strike ends soon, GM will be able to crank up production to make up for lost production time and mitigate some of the losses. But if it lasts more than a week, it will start to affect production in Canada and Mexico, putting more pressure on GM's inventory. If supplies dwindle, consumers may go to other brands, costing GM sales and market share.  GM and the union are negotiating at a time of troubling uncertainty for the U.S. auto industry.  GM is facing weakening sales, a deteriorating global economy and an unpredictable trade war as it tries to keep its labor costs in check through 2023. But workers want a bigger share of GM's healthy profits, which totaled more than $30 billion in the past five years.  Driven up by the longest economic expansion in American history, auto sales appear to have peaked and are heading down. Long-term challenges also loom: GM and other carmakers are struggling to make the transition to electric vehicles.  Gary Chaison, professor emeritus of industrial relations at Clark University in Massachusetts, expects the strike to end within a week. He sees it as more of a message to show how effective the union is, especially for nonunion workers who might be asked to join the UAW.  GM's offers, he said, seem to be pretty good, so the strike is a mystery to him. ""I can't see a prolonged strike coming out of this,"" he said. ""I think there's too much to lose and not enough to gain.""",business
41,From Scarborough to Hollywood and back: 2 star brothers promote homegrown talent,"Stephan James and brother Shamier Anderson are working with some of Hollywood's biggest talent — think Julia Roberts and Nicole Kidman — but they haven't forgotten their roots up north.  ""We have a responsibility,"" said Anderson. ""A black man coming from this country and being an actor working worldwide, I got to make sure that I keep striving for the best so I can continue to inspire other individuals ... making my family and my country proud.""  James, 25, and Anderson, 28, grew up in the Toronto borough of Scarborough. They credit their mother, a single parent, with believing in their acting skills and giving them roots. Anderson ventured into acting in 2010 and James followed soon after. Since then, the gigs have been steadily rolling in for both.  Anderson most recently starred opposite Kidman and Tatiana Maslany in the 2018 film Destroyer, is shooting a Netflix film in Toronto and was named one of TIFF's rising stars this year.    The same title was given to James in 2015. Since then, he's starred alongside Roberts in the podcast-based series Homecoming, now approaching its second season. He was nominated for a Golden Globe this year for the drama and walked the Oscars red carpet for his equally buzzy film starring Regina King and directed by Academy Award winner Barry Jenkins, If Beale Street Could Talk.  Combined, the Canadian brothers are taking Hollywood by storm — and using that profile to support more budding, diverse stars at home.  ""What me and my brother want to do is we want to find the talent here, the homegrown talent here, and show them the support now,"" said James.    'Huge celebration of incredibly talented Canadians'  And they're doing it in the form of the B.L.A.C.K. Ball, ""a huge celebration of incredibly talented Canadians,"" says James. It's become an annual event the brothers host in Toronto to promote rising Canadians in the business.  ""Even being in the system of the Canadian industry, we felt at the time there was a lack of support in the star system and building stars and fostering them and fostering talent and resources,"" said Anderson.    Among attendees this year, Avengers directors Joe and Anthony Russo and Canadian actress Amanda Brugel, who stars in the series The Handmaid's Tale. Brugel says an event like this couldn't be more timely as the entertainment industry moves toward more inclusion.  ""Everything has changed,"" said Brugel. ""I'm a 42-year-old woman of colour and I couldn't be busier … And the idea that it's not slowing down — that it's only starting to really rev up — gives me hope.""  Opening doors to inclusion  Brugel says the more gains made by Canadians — particularly actors of colour — the more doors that can open for others looking for role models. And that's one of James's main goals in returning home, says Elle Canada editor-in-chief Vanessa Craft. James is on the cover of the magazine's September issue.  ""We're finally embracing the talent that we have locally as opposed to looking outside our city for talent,"" said Craft.  ""One of the things Stephan said in our interview with him was, 'Why do I have to go to America to find heroes? To find someone to look up to? Why can't I just do that myself? Why can't I be one of those people?'""    For James and Anderson, it's only the beginning.  Anderson can next be seen opposite Gina Rodriguez in the upcoming film Awake. James will star in the action thriller 21 Bridges opposite Black Panther's Chadwick Boseman, produced by the Russo brothers.  ""We haven't stopped talking about him since we worked together,"" said Anthony Russo. ""Honestly, it's like we literally sit in a room at our studio [and say], 'What else can we put Stephan in?'""  Considering the Russo brothers directed the superhero blockbuster Avengers: Endgame, the highest grossing film of all time and have themselves capitalized on the power of sibling unity, they'll likely have no trouble finding an answer.",entertainment
18,Talks resume as UAW strike against GM enters second day,"Talks are set to resume Tuesday after a pause overnight, but there was no end to the strike against General Motors.  Brian Rothenberg, spokesman for the UAW, said Tuesday ""They are talking, they've made progress, we'll see how long it takes.""  Negotiators took a break from bargaining around 9 p.m. Monday but were to be back at the tables on Tuesday.  The walkout by upward of 49,000 United Auto Workers members has brought to a standstill more than 50 factories and parts warehouses in the union's first strike against the No. 1 U.S. automaker in over a decade.  Workers left factories and formed picket lines shortly after midnight Monday in the dispute over a new four-year contract. The union's top negotiator said in a letter to the company that the strike could have been averted had the company made its latest offer sooner.  The letter dated Sunday suggests that the company and union are not as far apart as the rhetoric leading up to the strike had indicated. Negotiations continued Monday in Detroit after breaking off during the weekend.  But Rothenberg said the two sides have come to terms on only two per cent of the contract.  ""We've got 98 per cent to go,"" he said Monday.    Asked about the possibility of federal mediation, U.S. President Donald Trump said it's possible if the company and union want it.  ""Hopefully they'll be able to work out the GM strike quickly,"" Trump said before leaving the White House for New Mexico. ""Hopefully, they're going to work it out quickly and solidly.""  Shares down 4%  Wall Street did not like seeing the union picketers. GM shares closed Monday down more than 4 per cent to $37.21 US. In premarket trading Tuesday, shares edged up 16 cents.  On the picket line Monday at GM's transmission plant in Toledo, Ohio, workers who said they have been with the company for more than 30 years were concerned for younger colleagues who are making less money under GM's two-tier wage scale and have fewer benefits.  Paul Kane, from South Lyon, Michigan, a 42-year GM employee, said much of what the union is fighting for will not affect him.      It's their turn to pay us back. That was the promise they gave.  - Paul Kane, GM employee     ""It's not right when you're working next to someone, doing the same job and they're making a lot more money,"" he said. ""They should be the making the same as me. They've got families to support.""  Kane said GM workers gave up pay raises and made other concessions to keep GM afloat during its 2009 trip through bankruptcy protection.  ""Now it's their turn to pay us back,"" he said. ""That was the promise they gave.""  UAW vice-president Terry Dittes told GM that the company's latest offer might have made it possible to reach an agreement if it had come earlier.  ""We are disappointed that the company waited until just two hours before the contract expired to make what we regard as its first serious offer,"" Dittes wrote in the letter to Scott Sandefur, GM's vice-president of labour relations.  There are many important items left in the talks, including wage increases, pay for new hires, job security, profit sharing and treatment of temporary workers, Dittes wrote.  ""We are willing to meet as frequently, and for as long as it takes, to reach an agreement that treats our members fairly,"" the letter said.  Pay raises, health benefits on the table  GM issued a statement saying it wants to reach a deal that builds a strong future for workers and the business.  Rothenberg said that GM on Monday cancelled the workers' company-sponsored health insurance, but the UAW had policies in place and is covering striking workers.  The automaker said Sunday that it offered pay raises and $7 billion worth of U.S. factory investments resulting in 5,400 new positions, a minority of which would be filled by existing employees. GM would not give a precise number. The company also said it offered higher profit sharing, ""nationally leading"" health benefits and an $8,000 payment to each worker upon ratification.  Before the talks broke off, GM offered new products to replace work at two of four U.S. factories that it intends to close.  The company pledged to build a new all-electric pickup truck at a factory in Detroit, according to a person who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The person was not authorized to disclose details of the negotiations.    Plant closures  The automaker also offered to open an electric vehicle battery plant in Lordstown, Ohio, where it has a huge factory that has already stopped making cars and will be closed. The new factory would be in addition to a proposal to make electric vehicles for a company called Workhorse, the person said.  It's unclear how many workers the two plants would employ. The closures, especially of the Ohio plant, have become issues in the 2020 presidential campaign. Trump has consistently criticized the company and demanded that Lordstown be reopened.    Kristin Dziczek, vice-president of labour and industry for the Center for Automotive Research, an industry think-tank , said the letter and resumption of contract talks are encouraging signs. ""It makes me think that both sides are probably closer than it might have seemed before,"" she said.  But both Dziczek and Art Wheaton, an auto industry expert at the Worker Institute at Cornell University, say GM left out key details when it made part of its offer public, and working out those details could make the strike last longer.  ""I think GM kind of sabotaged some of the negotiations by going immediately to the public,"" Wheaton said. ""It really distorts the offer.""  The strike shut down 33 manufacturing plants in nine states across the U.S., as well as 22 parts-distribution warehouses. It's the first national strike by the union since a two-day walkout in 2007 that had little impact on the company.  Workers at Fiat Chrysler and Ford continued working under contract extensions. Any agreement reached with GM will serve as a template for talks with the other two companies.",business
162,Autoworkers at GM's Oshawa plant ask feds for more than $1B to build electric vehicles,"Workers at the General Motors Oshawa assembly plant are calling on the federal government to fund a project that would transform the site into a publicly owned electric vehicle factory.  The group, called Green Jobs Oshawa, revealed details of the plan at a public forum on Thursday evening.  ""What could make more sense than the government stepping in and saying, 'We will ensure that we will keep jobs here, that we develop the technology here and that we build the vehicles of the future here?'"" said Tony Leah, chairperson of the Local 222 Political Action Committee.  The Oshawa factory is one of five North American assembly plants owned by GM that are set to close at the end of the year. GM plans to turn the site into smaller-scale stamping and testing facility after 2019.  GM employs around 2,500 workers at the facility, which has been a pillar of Canada's auto industry since it opened in 1907.  ""It would mean the world to me if we could get this to come to fruition,"" said Rebecca Keetch, who works as an assembler.  The proposal to preserve auto manufacturing in Oshawa calls for a federal investment of $1.4 billion to $1.9 billion to transform the existing facility into a plant that would produce electric vehicles for government agencies such as Canada Post.  The study says the transformation would preserve around 13,000 jobs in Oshawa, leading to sales of 150,000 vehicles over the plant's first four years at a value of approximately $5.8 billion.     Those vehicles could also lead to a reduction of 400,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions over four years, according to the study, which was authored by consultant Russ Christianson.    Green Jobs Oshawa says achieving those lofty goals will require federal participation.  The group points to Ottawa's bailout of Canada's auto industry during the global financial crisis of 2008, when the federal government handed $13.7 billion to GM and Chrysler as the companies teetered on the verge of bankruptcy.  ""Any nation in the world that has a strong auto industry has a strong auto industry because of government participation,"" added Unifor national president Jerry Dias.  Bold idea, or 'job creation scheme?'  Bernie Wolf, a professor emeritus at York University's Schulich School of Business, described the plan as a ""job creation scheme"" that would be difficult to justify.  ""If this were really feasible, if this were really possible, wouldn't GM be doing this itself?"" asked Wolf, who studies the auto industry and vehicle manufacturing.    He said a government-owned plant would struggle to develop the technology needed to produce high-quality electric vehicles, meaning the plant would likely have to import technology from private companies.  Government agencies such as Canada Post could also purchase electric vehicles at lower prices from more established manufacturers, he argued.    ""The more I think about it, the less sense it makes,"" he added. Spending money educating workers would be a wiser long term investment, he argued.  While Wolf was skeptical of the plan, electric vehicle researcher Olivier Trescases called the idea an ""interesting and timely opportunity.""    Trescases, who runs the University of Toronto's Electric Vehicle Research Centre, said the project could succeed if it maintains a strict focus on producing vehicles for government use.  ""I think that aiming for government owned EV fleets and electrified public transportation is strategically very important and more logical than trying to produce passenger cars though a Crown corporation,"" he wrote in an email.  More hurdles to clear  While there is no indication that the next federal government would commit to such an expensive and ambitious project, there is some precedent for that type of acquisition.  In 1974, Ottawa purchased the aircraft manufacturer de Havilland, which produced the Dash series of turboprop regional airliners. However, the government sold the company to Boeing in 1986.  The German courier Deutsche Post, which was privatized in 1995, also purchased the electric vehicle company StreetScooter in 2014. It now has 10,000 electric vehicles in its fleet.    However, it is unclear if the publicly owned Canada Post has the capacity or desire to purchase several thousand electric vehicles.  In 2018, Canada Post purchased 500 hybrid delivery vehicles, which are going into service this year. In a statement to CBC, the Crown corporation said it ""continues to consider alternative propulsion technologies that can be rolled out at scale, including electric vehicles.""  Green Jobs Oshawa has acknowledged some of those logistical and financial challenges, but the group says the project should also be considered for its potential benefits to the environment and local community.  ""We have to look at a broader picture than just a bottom line,"" Leah said.",business
71,Everything you need to know about the 'repo loan' problem — and why it matters to you,"As if the U.S. Federal Reserve did not already have enough on its plate heading into its meeting on interest rates this week, chaos deep inside the plumbing of the U.S. financial system has thrown policymakers an unexpected curveball.  Cash available to banks for their short-term funding needs all but dried up earlier this week, and interest rates in U.S. money markets shot up to as high as 10 per cent for some overnight loans, more than four times the Fed's rate.     ANALYSIS: Why rates cuts in the U.S. will impact Canada    That forced the Fed to make an emergency injection of more than $125 billion over the past two days, its first major market intervention since the financial crisis more than a decade ago, to prevent borrowing costs from spiraling even higher. While the effort restored a measure of order to the short-term bank funding market, it was not enough to stop the Fed's benchmark lending rate from rising this week above its targeted range of 2.00 per cent to 2.25 per cent.  The exact cause of the squeeze is a matter of some debate, but most market participants agree that two coincidental events on Monday were at least partly to blame. First, corporations had to withdraw funds from money market accounts to pay for quarterly tax bills, and on the same day the banks and investors who bought the $78 billion of U.S. Treasury notes and bonds sold by Uncle Sam last week had to settle up.  On top of that, the reserves that banks park with the Fed and are often made available to other banks on an overnight basis are at their lowest since 2011 thanks to the central bank's culling of its vast portfolio of bonds over the past few years.  Added together, these factors are testing the limits of the $2.2 trillion repurchase agreement — or ""repo"" — market, a grey but essential component of the U.S. financial system.  Whatever the cause, the episode has added fuel to the argument that the Fed needs to take steps to avoid more disruptions in the repo market down the road.  Why is the 'repo' market important?  The repo market underpins much of the U.S. financial system, helping to ensure banks have the liquidity to meet their daily operational needs and maintain sufficient reserves.  In a repo trade, Wall Street firms and banks offer U.S. Treasuries and other high-quality securities as collateral to raise cash, often overnight, to finance their trading and lending activities. The next day, borrowers repay their loans plus what is typically a nominal rate of interest and get their bonds back. In other words, they repurchase, or repo, the bonds.  The system typically hums along with the interest rate charged on repo deals hovering close to the Fed's benchmark overnight rate, which it cut on Wednesday to 1.75 per cent to 2.00 per cent, from 2.00 per cent to 2.25 per cent.  But when investors get fearful of lending, as seen during the global credit crisis, or when there are just not enough reserves or cash in the system to lend out, it sends the repo rate soaring above the Fed Funds rate, because banks are desperate enough to pay the higher fees to meet their obligations.    Trading in stocks and bonds can become difficult. It can also pinch lending to businesses and consumers and, if the disruption is prolonged, it can become a drag on a U.S. economy that relies heavily on the flow of credit.  What has cause the drop in cash reserves at banks?  Coming out of the financial crisis, after the Fed cut interest rates to near zero and bought more than $3.5 trillion of bonds, banks built up massive reserves held at the Fed.  But that level of bank reserves, which peaked at nearly $2.8 trillion, began falling when the Fed started raising interest rates in late 2015. They fell even faster when the Fed started to cut the size of its bond portfolio about two years later.  The Fed stopped raising interest rates last year and cut them in July and again on Wednesday. It has also now ceased allowing bonds to roll off its balance sheet.  The question vexing policymakers now is whether those actions are enough to stop the downward drift in reserves, which are a main source of liquidity in funding markets like repo.  Bank reserves at the Fed last stood at $1.47 trillion, the lowest level since 2011 and nearly 50 per cent below their peak from five years ago.  What can policy makers do to calm the repo market?  Broadly, there are 4 options:     Run spot repo operations. Through the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Fed can conduct occasional spot repo operations at times of funding stress, allowing banks and dealers to swap their Treasuries and other high-quality securities for cash at a minimal interest rate. It did this on Tuesday and Wednesday.   Lower the interest rate it pays on excess reserves. By making it less profitable for banks, especially foreign ones, to leave their reserves at the Fed, it may encourage banks to lend to each other in money markets.   Create a permanent repo facility. Such a permanent financing program will allow eligible participants to exchange their bonds for cash at a set interest rate. The Fed and its staff have considered such a facility, but they have not determined who qualifies, what would be the level of interest paid and the timing for a possible launch.   Ramp up the buying of Treasuries. The Fed can replenish the level of bank reserves by slightly increasing its holdings of U.S. government debt. This comes with the risk that it may be perceived as a resurrection of quantitative easing rather than a technical adjustment.    What did the Fed do?  The central bank lowered interest on excess reserves by 30 basis points, to 1.80 per cent. The rate now sits 20 basis points below the top of the target range, compared to 15 basis points previously.  It also set its offering rate in the repo market at 1.70 per cent, five basis points below the bottom of the new target range for the policy rate.",business
16,"Montreal man has $800 in rolled change, but his bank won't deposit the money","Julien Perrotte stood in front of the representative at his local bank last week, unsure he properly understood what she was telling him.  He was carrying about $800 worth of coins, sorted and rolled, that he had collected over the past year. But she said Laurentian Bank wouldn't deposit them.  ""I'm like, 'It doesn't make sense,'"" Perrotte told CBC News.  The woman told him he could exchange the coins for bills at local grocery stores, corner stores and pharmacies because ""they love coins.""  But Perrotte, who works as an independent insurance claims adjuster, says he doesn't have time to shop around for a small business to take his change — especially when it's a service he expects to receive from his bank.  He called Laurentian Bank's customer service line to see if there was any other way the bank would take his hundreds of loonies and toonies.  He was told it was a new policy at the bank not to accept coins.  ""Pretty much, I was exasperated,"" said Perrotte, who has been a member of Laurentian Bank for 15 years.  ""It's so absurd.… Everyone has coins, that's for sure. Poor people, rich people.""  The other option Perrotte considered was to exchange the coins at a Coinstar machine, which are at some grocery stores and malls, but the machines charge about 12 per cent in fees for the service.  ""So I would lose like 80 bucks just to try to get rid of money. And my bank doesn't want my money!"" Perrotte said.  Some bank branches going cashless      As Perrotte points out, the Royal Canadian Mint is still producing coins as legal tender. But he now wonders who is ensuring that banks will take them.  He's worried other banks will follow Laurentian's lead.  In a response to a request for comment from CBC News, Royal Canadian Mint spokesperson Alex Reeves said the Crown corporation's mandate is limited to manufacturing and distributing Canadian currency.  It has no authority over how coins are exchanged, he wrote in an email.       The future of cash in Canada     ""Canadian businesses are free to determine what forms of legal tender they will accept as payments or deposits,"" Reeves said.  Reeves noted CIBC's decision to open some cashless branches as an example of ""the level of discretion allowed in Canada.""  A Canadian Bankers Association spokesperson told CBC News that the majority of financial institutions that take cash deposits still accept rolled coins at their branches.  'If they don't want to take my money, I'll change banks'  In a statement, Laurentian Bank said it ""transitioned its branch network from a traditional offer to 100% Advice.""  Spokesperson Hélène Soulard wrote that the ""only service no longer offered in our 100% Advice model to retail customers is the deposit of coins.""  Notes can still be deposited via the bank's network of automated banking machines.  Perrotte says he understands the bank's need to cut costs, but wonders whether Laurentian Bank is having more trouble than it lets on.  ""I love my bank. I live right near it, it's my neighbour. It's a nice bank, but at the end of the day if they don't want to take my money I'll change banks,"" he said.    Laurentian Bank is in the process of implementing a transformation plan with the goal of boosting profits and doubling in size as more Canadians use online banking services.  In February, the bank said it would lay off about 300 employees and close 50 branches this year in an effort to save up to $20 million per year in operating costs.  In July, the bank announced it was phasing out tellers at its physical locations.  In its quarterly report ending in July, the bank reported a profit of $47.8 million, down nearly 13 per cent when compared to a year earlier.  ""I would be OK, as a millennial, to stop the coins and just go full electronic,"" said Perrotte.  But as long as coins are still in circulation, he says that banks should still take them.   In its quest to compete with digital startups, Perrotte says Laurentian Bank just lost a customer.",business
177,B.C.'s 911 system to be revamped after fatal 35-minute rescue delay,"Changes are coming to B.C.'s 911 system, after an external investigation ordered by B.C.'s health minister found response delays ""possibly influenced"" the death of a Vancouver woman.  In November, Tracey Gundersen, 56 — a Downtown Eastside resident with a drug addiction — called 911 after she started to hemorrhage.  It took ambulance attendants 35 minutes to reach her, because doors and an elevator in her secure building were locked and firefighters with master keys were called in too late.   Now, an independent review has found Gundersen's death may have been avoidable. It makes 14 recommendations ""to improve care of future patients"" and prevent deaths, including having firefighters attend whenever access might be an issue.  The investigation was ordered by Health Minister Adrian Dix after a direct appeal from Gundersen's daughter— a police emergency call-taker.  ""No one should call for help and not receive it,"" said Chelsea Brent, 26.    ""It brings me to tears often because it's not something that you ever wish on someone; to die alone and scared and wondering if help was ever going to arrive.""  Dix agrees.  ""This is a serious case. It's a tragic case. It's a heartbreaking case,"" he said. ""There are lessons to be learned and that's why I did it.""    Chilling 911 call  According to the investigation, Gundersen frantically phoned 911 at 8:15 a.m. on Nov. 8, 2018 to report she was hemorrhaging.  ""My groin, it's abscessed and it's bleeding profusely,"" she says in a recording obtained by Brent through a freedom of information request.  An ambulance is dispatched within one minute to Gundersen's low-income apartment complex at 250 Powell street— a former high-security provincial remand centre.  ""There's lotsa help on the way,"" assures the male call-taker.  He tells Gundersen to apply pressure with a towel, but the blood seeps through.  ""I'm getting all dizzy … all dizzy in the head,"" she states four minutes later.  At the five minute mark, the ambulance siren can be heard in the background.  ""I can't put any pressure on it,"" says Gundersen, referring to the bleeding abscess. ""I can't handle opening the door.""  ""Okay … we're gonna figure-out a way in, okay?"" promises the call-taker.  But the ambulance attendants hit the locked doors of her building and Gundersen starts to fade.  ""I've lost that much blood I'm blurry,"" she says. ""Oh please!""  Thirty seconds later, Gundersen utters her last intelligible words on the recording.  ""Please hurry.""    Ten minutes later, around 8:32 a.m., records show ambulance dispatch calls Fire for assistance.  Although a fire hall is one block away, a more distant fire crew takes another 10 minutes to arrive.  At 8:50 a.m., emergency crews finally gain access to Gundersen's sixth floor apartment — 35 minutes after she first called 911.   It's too late.  She's found with no pulse. All resuscitation methods fail.  Firefighters' role expanded  The 26-page report investigating Gundersen's death was authored by two emergency care experts, one from B.C., the other from Ontario.  They call for better communication and coordination among call-takers, dispatchers, ambulance and fire — and for firefighters to attend all medical calls where access might be an issue.  All 14 recommendations will be implemented, said Dix.  He denies the changes will roll-back a controversial policy introduced in May 2018, which stopped firefighters from responding to all but urgent medical calls — a move that was supposed to improve the efficient use of ambulance and fire crews.  ""I don't think it's a rollback at all. It just makes sense,"" said Dix. ""Let's get on with making the service better.""    'I can't say a policy killed her, but...'  Brent blames the policy change made six months before Gundersen's 911 call for the delay that may have contributed to her mother's death.  In addition to cutting the number of medical calls attended by both ambulance and fire, B.C. Emergency Health Services (BCEHS) brought in a colour-coded ranking system.  At the time, BCEHS, which oversees emergency dispatching in the province, promised the moves would ""better match resources to patient needs.""    Gundersen's call was labelled a mid-level ""code orange,"" which means ""urgentu002Fpotentially serious,"" but ""not immediately life-threatening.""  As a result, firefighters were not dispatched with the ambulance crew. Without master keys, the paramedics couldn't access Gundersen's locked building.  ""I can't say a policy killed her,"" says Brent, ""but I can say where [the emergency dispatch system] was in April or May 2018, it would have been a lot different.""  Fire and Ambulance react  In a statement, the head of B.C. Emergency Health Services said she welcomes any new recommendations from the independent investigation.  Barb Fitzsimmons said BCEHS will work with the health ministry ""to make changes needed to prevent something like this from happening again.""  Vancouver Fire Chief Darrell Reid, speaking through a spokesperson, said he needs time to review the report before commenting.  'Something did go drastically wrong'  Brent said she's ""very appreciative"" B.C.'s health minister listened to her plea for a review of her mother's death.  ""He did approve this policy change and people had said 'this is going to go wrong,'"" said Brent. ""And something did go drastically wrong. I think maybe he just saw …this isn't the right option, maybe things do need to change.""  Brent wanted to fight one last fight for her mother.  ""My Mom did not receive the respect and the care that I feel she could have received,"" she said.  ""I know she never loved attention, but I think she would be thankful.""

2,'This is ground zero': Conservative ex-MPs try to win back crucial GTA seats,"Six former MPs in the Greater Toronto Area are aiming for a political comeback by trying to regain crucial seats for the federal Conservative Party.  Their victories in swing ridings in 2011 were key to Stephen Harper's majority, while their subsequent defeats in 2015 heralded the Liberal Party's domination of the GTA under Justin Trudeau.   How these six candidates perform on election night in October will give a strong indication of the success of Andrew Scheer's 2019 campaign.     Etobicoke Centre: Ted Opitz   Mississauga-Lakeshore: Stella Ambler   Mississauga East-Cooksville: Wladyslaw Lizon   Newmarket-Aurora: Lois Brown   Oakville: Terence Young   Richmond Hill: Costas Menegakis    All six are considered target ridings by Scheer's Conservatives for multiple reasons, including their suburban makeup, the candidates' past wins, and the victories of Doug Ford's Progressive Conservatives there in last year's Ontario election.   ""This is ground zero. This is where we have to win if we're going to win government,"" said Stella Ambler, the Conservative candidate in Mississauga-Lakeshore.    Ambler served as the riding's MP from 2011 to 2015. Her loss by 3,700 votes was the tightest race in the Liberals' 2015 sweep of Mississauga's six seats.  ""Sure it's hard to lose, but honestly you can't take it personally, this business,"" said Ambler in an interview.    She said her decision to try again after the loss wasn't actually difficult, but required a little personal backtracking. ""My husband reminded me that I said four years ago that I would never do this again,"" Ambler said with a laugh.        Other party candidates in Mississauga-Lakeshore    Cynthia Trentelman (Green)   Eugen Vizitiu (People's Party)    The NDP has not yet named a candidate       For Ambler, it is a rematch of her 2015 race against Sven Spengemann of the Liberals, but this time he is the incumbent.  ""It's a totally different campaign, the feeling is different,"" said Ambler.  The voters of Mississauga-Lakeshore are ""open-minded,"" she said. ""They gave Justin Trudeau a chance but this time they're not gonna do it, so I'm confident it's going to swing back.""    Signalling the importance of Etobicoke Centre to the Conservatives, Scheer made Ted Opitz's campaign office a stop on his leader's tour Wednesday afternoon.  Opitz admits his 2015 loss was disappointing, but says he's always kept the possibility of a comeback in mind.  ""The decision was actually easier than I thought it would be,"" he said in an interview. ""I enjoyed being in Parliament, I enjoyed serving.""     Opitz is not facing an incumbent, as the Liberal he lost to in 2015, Borys Wrzesnewskyj, isn't running. The Liberal candidate is Yvan Baker, who represented the riding provincially at Queen's Park for a term before losing in 2018.     ""It's a tough riding to win and you can take nothing for granted,"" said Opitz. His 2011 win was about as tight as it gets, by a margin of 26 votes. It wasn't sealed until the following year, when a Supreme Court of Canada ruling upheld his victory.    Among the other former Conservative MPs seeking a comeback in GTA ridings, both Brown in Newmarket-Aurora and Young are contesting their fifth straight federal election. Each lost in 2006, won in 2008 and 2011, and lost in 2015. Both are facing first-time Liberal candidates as the incumbents are not seeking re-election.    Menegakis's defeat in 2015 came in the riding of Aurora - Oak Ridges - Richmond Hill. He'd switched to contesting that riding after the boundaries for Richmond Hill were re-drawn.",politics
141,"Trudeau promises to raise basic personal deduction to $15K, cut cellphone bills","Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau says his party would raise the basic personal income tax deduction to $15,000 and cut cellphone bills by a quarter if re-elected in October.  The cost of cell service is controlled by the ""Big 3"" companies — Rogers, Telus and Bell — who share a near-monopoly on Canada's wireless networks. A Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission report found that the three controlled 91 per cent of all wireless service revenues in 2016.  Canadians pay some of the highest cell bills in the world, with monthly plans ranging from around $40 to over $100.  Trudeau said the Liberal proposal would save the average family almost $1,000 a year.   To lower the cost, the Liberals say they would open up the market to more competition and work with cell companies to offer plans that more closely mirror global prices. They would also implement an unlimited family plan. More rules could kick in after two years if the prices don't decrease enough.    How much that proposal would cost is unclear.  ""We know that Canadians are concerned about affordability,"" Trudeau said.  Earlier this week the NDP also put out their plan to cap prices of cellphone and internet services — which would save families an estimated $250 a year.    In a statement on Sunday, Robert Ghiz, president and CEO of the Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Association, which represents most of the country's major carriers,  said wireless prices have already come down around 30 per cent over the past three years — and will continue to decrease.  ""As we enter a world of 5G, it is critical that we encourage investment in network technology, the backbone of the Canadian economy,"" Ghiz said.""We need to balance driving affordability with investing long-term so Canadians continue to enjoy world-class networks.""  Basic personal income deduction to rise  The Liberals crammed a second, unrelated promise into Trudeau's appearance in Brampton, Ont. Like most others of this campaign, it was also focused on affordability.  Trudeau said a Liberal government would raise the basic personal income tax deduction to $15,000 for people earning under $147,000 — meaning you would only pay taxes on income over that amount. Currently, the basic personal deduction is $12,069. The increase would be phased in, reaching $15,000 by 2023.  The Liberals estimate this will save an individual just under $300 a year, while families would save $585.   ""We have to realize that the cost of living is going up,"" Trudeau said.    The tax cut would cost $2.9 billion to start, increasing to $5.6 billion by 2023-2024.  The Liberals haven't released costing of several promises through the Parliamentary Budget Officer's new program that allows parties to submit their campaign proposals for costing. They have faced criticism for it.   Trudeau said the tax cut would lift 40,000 people out of poverty and the party added it would encompass about 700,000 more Canadians.   ""We have a sustainable fiscal plan,"" Trudeau said.   The Liberals were running a $15-billion deficit before the campaign and have been cagey about a timeline back to balance. The party has promised a fully costed platform, but it has not been released yet.   The Conservatives have already announced a tax cut of a different kind. Last week Andrew Scheer said a Conservative government would cut the tax rate on taxable income under $47,630 to 13.75 per cent from 15 per cent.  The party says that would save the average single taxpayer about $444 a year. A two-income couple earning an average salary would save about $850 a year.",politics
117,Beautiful and depressing: Picasso's 'blue period' paintings heading to the AGO,"The Art Gallery of Ontario is planning a major Pablo Picasso exhibition focused on the painter's popular ""blue period.""  The Toronto gallery says the exhibit, ""Picasso: Painting the Blue Period,"" will include approximately 65 pieces by the Spaniard, as well as a selection of works by other artists he would have known and studied.    The exhibit includes major international loans from private collections and public institutions in North America, Europe, Japan and Israel.  Set to run next summer, the gallery says it will be the first exhibition on Picasso's blue period to be mounted in Canada.  The blue period includes the years between 1901 and 1904 when Picasso created largely monochromatic paintings in shades of blue and blue-green.  The exhibit is being co-organized by the Art Gallery of Ontario and The Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C. It's set to run June 27 to Sept. 20, 2020.",entertainment
55,"New Liberal gun-control policies coming soon, as firearms lobby gears up for a fight","A re-elected Liberal government will ban some types of ""assault-style"" rifles, as well as introduce additional restrictions on where firearms can be possessed or stored, according to Bill Blair, who has been the party's pointman on gun control.  The planned measures will be announced ""very, very shortly"" as part of the Liberals' campaign platform, Blair said in an interview with The Fifth Estate.   ""I have recommended that there are certain weapons that are currently not prohibited that should be prohibited, which means no one should be allowed to have those weapons in our society,"" he said.  ""I will tell you that I am confident that a Liberal government will enact effective regulation and legislation … to remove weapons that are, in my opinion, just too dangerous in a civil society.""    One particular firearm in Blair's sights is the AR-15, which has been used in multiple U.S. mass shootings, including at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., an outdoor music festival in Las Vegas and Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.  ""That weapon was designed for — and has always been intended for — the killing of enemy combatants. It is not a toy,"" said Blair, who served as the minister for organized crime reduction under the last government.  'A really important time for gun owners'  Canada's gun lobby has been expecting a gun ban from the Liberals, and several groups say they are mobilizing their members to vote in October's federal election like never before.   There are 2.2 million men and women who own gun licences in Canada.  ""This is a really important time for gun owners,"" said Tracey Wilson, of the Canadian Coalition for Firearm Rights (CCFR). ""It has never been more true than it is right now. This is it.""    The issue of gun control was thrust back into the spotlight after another violent shooting in the Greater Toronto Area over the weekend. A 17-year-old was killed and five others injured in Mississauga, Ont., and police say they're looking for multiple gunmen, armed mostly with semi-automatic weapons.  The ""ambush-style"" shooting prompted comments from all three major party leaders.    As part of their platform for the 2015 election, the Liberals blamed former prime minister Stephen Harper for weakening the country's gun laws ""in ways that make Canadians more vulnerable and communities more dangerous.""  ""We will take action to get handguns and assault weapons off our streets,"" the party declared at the time.  Nathalie Provost says she was initially encouraged by the pledge. Provost was among those shot during the 1989 attack at Montreal's École Polytechnique and has been championing stricter gun regulations in Canada for years.   In 2017, the Liberal government appointed her vice-chair of a committee to advise the public safety minister on Canada's gun policies.    But this summer, Provost quit in frustration, saying she was ""extremely disappointed"" in the ""obviously useless"" consultations that preceded the Liberals' firearms legislation, Bill C-71, which enhanced background checks on gun buyers, but did not prohibit handguns or semi-automatic rifles.  ""From my own point of view, they lack courage,"" said Provost. ""They lack the will to do something that we need to be done.""  Bill C-71 faced strong opposition from gun rights advocates, who maintain the legislation will do little, if anything, to actually reduce gun-related crime in Canada, particularly for firearms smuggled in from the U.S.    Even before the election campaign began, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer vowed to repeal the legislation.  The most recent poll on the issue, conducted by the Angus Reid Institute, found 75 per cent of Canadians, including a majority of gun owners themselves, support a ban on assault-style weapons.   ""If we were in a democracy, we'd have had a ban on assault weapons a long time ago,"" said Heidi Rathjen, a graduate of École Polytechnique.   In 1991, Rathjen brought petitions signed by more than a half-million Canadians to Parliament Hill, demanding a ban on semi-automatic weapons like the gun used at École Polytechnique.    ""It's not happening and the only explanation is the strength of the gun lobby,"" she said. ""The gun lobby is winning in the long run. It's getting worse.""  For people like Blair Hagen, vice-president of the National Firearms Association, just defeating the Liberals on Oct. 21 isn't enough. He wants a constitutional change to enshrine the right to bear arms in Canada, just like the U.S.  ""There's been a lot of talk about that, and a lot of talk about property rights,"" said Hagen, who manages a gun store in Vancouver. ""Firearms are property in this country — and I think that's something that governments often forget.""    Blair rejects that argument, saying ""we don't have a Second Amendment here.""  ""Firearm ownership in this country is a privilege,"" he said. ""It's a privilege earned by people who would adhere to our laws and our regulations. And if they don't adhere to our laws and regulations, they lose that privilege.""  Tony Bernardo, of the Canadian Shooting Sports Association (CSSA), said he doesn't consider guns and rifles — including the controversial AR-15 — as weapons.   ""They're firearms … Weapons are things that are used to hurt people; 2.2 million Canadians use this as a sport and don't hurt anybody,"" he said.    His organization has had success fighting proposed gun bans before. In 2014, it lobbied the Harper government to override the RCMP firearms program when it wanted to prohibit the CZ-858 rifle.  The Fifth Estate obtained a 2013 RCMP report which said their testing revealed the gun could be converted to a fully automatic — and therefore illegal — firearm ""in a relatively short period of time with relative ease."" The firearms program found that ""neither specialized tools nor skilled workmanship were required"" to modify the gun into one capable of firing multiple rounds with a single squeeze of the trigger.  Still, in 2015, the Conservatives passed Bill C-42, which gave the government the power to override RCMP firearms' classifications, and the government reversed the prohibited classification of the CZ-858.  Current licensing system  Hagen criticizes the current Canadian gun-licensing system for focusing on ""people who want to be law-abiding.""   ""They're focused on people who go through the whole regime of getting a licence,"" he said. ""How do Canada's restrictions on firearms prevent [mass shootings]? Apparently they don't.""  Mass shootings with assault-style firearms are rare in Canada, but have happened.   Alexandre Bissonnette used a legally owned gun to attack a mosque in Quebec City in 2017, killing six men and seriously wounding five others.  And Kimveer Gill, who carried out a shooting at Montreal's Dawson College in 2006, was also a legal gun owner. École Polytechnique attacker Marc Lepine was a legal firearm owner, too.    For her part, Provost doesn't dispute that most firearms owners who hunt or engage in sport shooting are law-abiding. ""But what … they are playing with is extraordinarily dangerous,"" she said.  A mere rumour of a ban earlier this year prompted some members of the Canadian gun lobby to mount a unique campaign against it, imploring supporters to go out and buy AR-15s.  ""Buy one, buy two, buy three — buy whatever you can,"" said Wilson, of the CCFR. ""Let them know that Bill Blair sent you, that Bill Blair is Canada's biggest gun salesman.""    After that call out, some gun stores claimed to have run out of the popular rifle.   As for Provost and Rathjen, they say they're going to keep using their voices, too, as they ready to mark three decades since the École Polytechnique shooting later this year.   ""I think it's very sad that the witnesses and victims of the Polytechnique massacre still have to fight 30 years later to get in common-sense gun control,"" Rathjen said.

75,Inflation rate nudges down to 1.9% as gasoline and vegetables got cheaper,"Canada's inflation rate cooled to a 1.9 per cent annual rate in August, Statistics Canada says, as the price of gasoline, fresh vegetables and fruit all got cheaper during the month.  August's rate came in 0.1 percentage point below July's level.  After bottoming out at 1.4 per cent in January, Canada's inflation rate has been at 1.9 per cent or above for six months in a row now.  Cheaper gasoline was one of the biggest factors in the cooling, as gasoline was 10 per cent cheaper in August 2019 than it was the same month a year earlier. The impact of that cheaper gas is so great that if gasoline is stripped out of the data, Canada's inflation rate would have been much higher — 2.4 per cent.  Canadians also paid 6.5 per cent less for fresh vegetables in August compared with July, marking the largest month-over-month decline in five years.   The price of a hotel room also fell, as the cost of traveller accommodation has fallen by 6.7 per cent in the past year. Travel accomodation costs have now fallen on an annualized basis for 14 months in a row.  On the flipside, the price of some things increased, which helped keep the overall inflation rate up. They include air fare, which has risen by 10.3 per cent in the 12 months up to  the end of August.  Natural gas prices have also risen by 5.8 per cent during that time frame.  All things being equal, a lower inflation rate means that the Bank of Canada should be less likely to cut its rate in the near future, since it's a sign the economy isn't overheating. Currently, trading in investments known as overnight index swaps implies there's about a 1 in 5 chance of a rate cut from the Bank of Canada when it meets next month.  Despite the relatively benign inflation rate, economist James Marple at Toronto-Dominion Bank expects the bank will have to cut its rate eventually, because trade war tensions are making most central banks nervous.  ""We would not be surprised to see the Bank take out some insurance in the form of a rate cut later this year, moving it closer to the majority of its advanced economy peers,"" he said.",business
66,Why wearing blackface or brownface is considered 'reprehensible',"Dressing in blackface or brownface is a hurtful, racist and offensive act that mocks, dehumanizes and belittles other cultures while feeding into some of the worst stereotypes of people of colour, community leaders and experts say, reacting to the actions of Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau.  Their comments follow revelations Trudeau wore brownface as part of a costume at an Arabian Nights-themed gala in 2001, and his admission he wore blackface makeup at an event during high school.  ""I think that they're both reprehensible in the sense that the idea is that these communities can be replaced,"" said Tariq Amin-Khan, an associate professor of political science at Ryerson University in Toronto.  People with brown or black skin may feel demonized, ""and I think that that's something that should be quite upsetting for anyone,"" he said.  On Wednesday night in Halifax, Trudeau apologized for dressing up in brownface and a turban for a 2001 gala at the Vancouver private school where he was a teacher. He also admitted that at a talent show when he was in high school, he wore black makeup and sang The Banana Boat Song (Day-O), a Jamaican folk tune made famous by black American singer Harry Belafonte.    The 2001 incident was brought to light Wednesday evening with the publication of an article in Time magazine that showed a picture of Trudeau, with darkened skin and hands, dressed up like the fictional character Aladdin. A second picture later emerged of Trudeau at a talent show at Le collège Jean-de-Brébeuf in Montreal.  Speaking to reporters on his campaign plane Wednesday evening, Trudeau apologized for his actions, saying he now recognizes they were racist.    'Unacceptable' mythology  Carl Everton James, a professor of eduction at Toronto's York University who researches race and racism, said those kinds of actions are significant because of what brown skin and black skin have come to mean in society.   ""Are we doing it because we're saying brown skin or black skin are a noblesse skin colour and therefore we are going to imitate those people?      At one level it shows that Justin Trudeau's understanding about race and racism doesn't seem to have deep roots.  - Tariq Amin-Khan, associate professor, Ryerson University     ""Or do we see it as a way in which certain kinds of people are not quite like the 'white skin colour' and therefore, we do that,"" he added. ""So it becomes offensive because of what it represents.""  In an emotional statement, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh talked about the racism he has endured in his life, saying that seeing the image of Trudeau in brownface jarred him. He said it's ""going to bring up a lot of pain, it's going to bring up a lot of hurt.  ""The kids that see this image, the people that see this image, are going to think about all of the times in their life that they were made fun of, that they were hurt, and that they were hit, and they were insulted and they were made to feel less because of who they are.""    Although he thanked Trudeau for his apology, Mustafa Farooq, executive director of the National Council of Canadian Muslims, said in a statement that Trudeau's actions are ""deeply saddening,"" and wearing blackface and brownface is ""reprehensible.""    ""[It] hearkens back to a history of racism, slavery and an Orientalist mythology that is unacceptable,"" he said.  Blackface's dehumanizing history  In the early years of Hollywood, embracing brownface or blackface was common.   ""For [Trudeau] not to recognize the deep racism underlying this brownface imagery is quite revealing for me,"" Amin-Khan said. ""At one level it shows that Justin Trudeau's understanding about race and racism doesn't seem to have deep roots.""  But Rinaldo Walcott, a professor and director of the Women and Gender Studies Institute at the University of Toronto, said a distinction needs to be made between brownface and blackface.    ""Of course to brown up your face and to dress up as a fictional Arab is troubling and disconcerting,"" said Walcott, who specializes in studies of black culture.  But blackface has a long enduring deep history used to denigrate and dehumanize black people, he said.  ""And that's why it's really important to distinguish that history from the way in which white people have often imitated other people by using some of the same techniques but not with exactly the same kind of intent.""  Blacks, for example, were not allowed to appear in theatre, so many white men painted their faces black and recreated some of the worst racist stereotypes, Amin-Khan said.  They would use burnt cork or shoe polish to paint their skin black, leaving wide areas around the mouth that would variously be left uncovered or painted red or white to give the appearance of oversized lips, Philip Howard, assistant professor of integrated studies in education at McGill University in Montreal, wrote in a piece for The Conversation titled The problem with blackface.  ""Once in blackface, minstrels would use exaggerated accents, malapropisms, awkward movements and garish attire to further ridicule black people,"" he wrote.    It became a popular form of racist entertainment in the U.S. in the 1820s with the first minstrel shows, Howard wrote. But it also was popular in Canada. Indeed, Quebec musician Calixa Lavallée, composer of the Canadian national anthem, O Canada, travelled as a blackface minstrel.   While the blackface minstrelsy endured into the mid-1900s, performances continued in other forms, and were found on university campuses or during Halloween or other events.  In 2011, for example, a group of white business students at the University de Montreal decide to pay ""tribute"" to Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt by painting themselves black. In 2014, students at Brock University in St. Catharines, Ont.,, according to the Toronto Star, ""won a campus pub Halloween contest ... after they wore blackface to dress as the Jamaican bobsled team.""  As Howard notes, today's blackface wearers may claim they don't believe in the biological inferiority of black people, but wearing the dark makeup ""is evidence of their ongoing, racist over-assessment of the significance of skin colour differences. In this way, blackface is dehumanizing.  ""The very need to use garish makeup as part of the process of portraying black people reveals an attempt to establish an essential difference between black and white people,"" he wrote.",politics
118,New SNL cast member Shane Gillis dropped over racist comments,"Saturday Night Live has rescinded its invitation to a new cast member who posted a video last year in which he used a racial slur for Chinese people and derided Asians trying to learn English.  A show representative said Monday that the language Shane Gillis used was ""offensive, hurtful and unacceptable,"" and the show was not aware of the past remarks that have drawn criticism.  Saturday Night Live apologized, saying it's vetting process ""was not up to our standard.""  In a tweet, Gillis said he respected the show's decision and is ""honestly grateful for the opportunity."" He said he had hoped to have the opportunity to prove himself, but ""I understand it would be too much of a distraction."" He ended with a slight swipe at the show, mentioning that he was always a Mad TV guy anyway.  In the clip of video apparently posted in 2018, Gillis refers to an unidentified city's Chinatown as being ""nuts"" and used a derogatory word for Chinese people. He also complained about ""hearing an Asian trying to learn English.""  The representative said the show hired Gillis ""on the strength of his talent as a comedian and his impressive audition for SNL.""    The clip of Gillis re-emerged last week just hours after NBC said that he and two others, including the show's only Asian American performer, were joining the cast as featured players.  Saturday Night Live has taken heat over the years for an overall lack of ethnic diversity, with scant Asian representation among its cast members or hosts.  Former members Fred Armisen and Rob Schneider both are one-quarter Asian, but neither has been widely recognized for their Asian ancestry. Among hosts, the long history of SNL includes a short list of Asian or Asian Americans, with Canadian-born Sandra Oh, Awkwafina and Jackie Chan among them.",entertainment
199,David Suzuki on the global youth climate movement,"Last Friday, millions of people turned out for climate strikes across the globe. In Halifax, young protesters held a rally and staged a die-in to draw attention to the issue and demand change from politicians.  With young people leading the global climate movement, environmentalist David Suzuki and former diplomat Stephen Lewis hope that means they'll turn out to vote in the upcoming federal election. Suzuki and Lewis are in Halifax for an event called the Climate First Tour.  Suzuki spoke with Portia Clark from CBC Nova Scotia's Information Morning about young people carrying the burden of advocating for change, and why it's a more critical time than ever for young people to vote.  Their conversation has been edited for clarity and length.  What did you make of those images of Friday's protests?  I'm humiliated that children have to be the ones now carrying the weight of this issue. This isn't what children should be doing. They shouldn't have to be worrying about the kind of world they're going to grow up in.    There's a poll out today saying that fewer Canadians trust science. How have we landed in this position?  That is a very sad indictment of, in many ways, media. But also, I think it's a reflection of the fact that the fossil fuel industry has spent billions of dollars in a campaign of disinformation for over 30 years now.  I think in the process, scientists have suffered in terms of public trust. We're in this terrible situation, but the reality is the science is impeccable. It's gotten stronger and stronger and the children are now telling us we've got to do something.    So you don't want the children to stop what they're doing, but you want other people to pick up the mantle.  Absolutely right, I'm grateful to it. But as an adult who was part of the whole generation that really didn't pay attention to it, it's very sad that they're having to do that.  Greta [Thunberg] has had an impact more than all the other environmentalists in the world put together. Just a child, the innocence of her message, she cuts through it all. She's telling politicians, ""Don't tell me you're protecting my future. Don't tell me to go back to school and stop worrying. I want you to worry. I want you to do something."" And it's very powerful.  What new commitments are you hoping to get out of politicians?  This is no longer a partisan issue. When Japan attacked Pearl Harbor and … Roosevelt declared war, no one saw it as a Democratu002FRepublican issue. They were united to win this battle.  Well, we're now in a battle over emissions and we've all got to come together. It's outrageous that any political party would actually deny the reality of climate change or even its importance.     What we're trying to do now is get young people out to vote. The 18 to 22 year olds, it's their future. That's really at stake. Go to all candidates meetings, and ask their position on climate.

234,Battle of the Blades is back and there are going to be bruises,"Battle of the Blades is back and ready to entertain Canadian audiences with its strange hybrid of two of the country's best loved sports: hockey and figure skating.  The popular reality TV show makes its return to CBC-TV on Thursday night after a six-year hiatus, once again pairing hockey players with figure skaters to see who can perform the best on-ice routine.  This season the show airs live in front of an audience at rinks in Hamilton, Mississauga, Oshawa and Toronto as the pairs compete for a $100,000 donation to the charities of their choice.   Since the duos are judged on their skills and grace, the hockey players have the biggest adjustment.    The show's title is apt since hockey players have to battle with wearing figure skates, which includes the toe pick (a set of jagged teeth at the front of the blade) that can cause a skater to suddenly fall forward if they're not careful.  ""The first day I got here about five minutes and then went down,"" said Bruno Gervais, who played defence for the New York Islanders.   ""I got a black and blue elbow. I got a chipped tooth. I got a sprained wrist, black and blue knees. It's all part of it.""    This year, two of the seven pairs feature female hockey players matched with male figure skaters: Amanda Kessel, who won a gold medal with Team USA at the last Winter Olympics, and her Team Canada rival Natalie Spooner.  ""In hockey it doesn't matter what you look like just as long as you get the job done and you score some goals — you put the puck in the net, you can be as ugly a skater as you want,"" said Natalie Spooner, who won an Olympics Gold medal and the Clarkson Cup championship in 2014.  ""Then you come to figure skating and it's really all about pointing your toes, your shoulders back, smiling.""    Spooner points out that she's bigger than most female figure skaters, an added challenge for her partner, ice dancing champion Andrew Poje who has to lift her in the air.  ""I don't think little girls have probably seen a figure skater quite as big as me, so hopefully it shows them that they can do anything that they put their mind to and want to do.""    This season's cast of male hockey players includes former ""enforcers"" Colton Orr and Brian McGrattan, who fought each other 10 times during their NHL careers.   ""I think most of the hockey guys would like to prove that we can do other things than what we've done on the ice,"" said McGratton, a towering six foot four inch former winger who played for several teams including the Calgary Flames. ""Show off our skills, our smooth skating abilities and grace.""  Another ""tough guy,"" P.J. Stock, was brought in as a late replacement for Colby Armstrong, who sustained a hamstring injury during rehearsals. Armstrong will appear as a guest judge alongside other rotating guest judges, who include Canadian ice dancing champions Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir, and head judge Kurt Browning.  Stock is paired with Violetta Afanasieva, who was his Battle of the Blades partner on season two of the show.   The type of male hockey players who come on Battle of the Blades are the ones who are used to taking risks to be part of a team, according to Stock.  ""Some of the other guys, they're a little concerned sometimes about the image that you could possibly get by falling on national television in figure skates,"" he said.     Another of this year's competitors is Sheldon Kennedy, who has been a spokesperson for victims of child abuse, after his junior hockey coach was charged with sexual assault for the abuse he suffered as a teenager.  He said being out of his comfort zone by wearing figure skates instead of hockey skates doesn't faze him.  ""Sadly, for a lot of time in my life I've been out of my comfort zone,"" he said.  Kennedy — who is paired with figure skater Kaitlyn Weaver — welcomes the opportunity that Battle of the Blades will bring him, and others.   ""I spent a lot of years in that dark place, and we've done a lot of work around trying to prepare and set things up systematically to allow people to get out of that dark place and now we need to show it. And to me this is the reality: we can have fun, there is a way out and this is about hope.   ""And that's what we're skating for: to show people that there's hope. And to smile again.""  Battle of the Blades premieres Thursday, September 19 at 8 p.m. (8:30 NT) on CBC and the free CBC Gem streaming service.",entertainment
10,Court of appeal tells B.C. to reconsider Trans Mountain environmental conditions,"The B.C. Court of Appeal has instructed the province to reconsider its environmental assessment certificate and conditions issued for the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project.  In their challenges, the Squamish Nation and the City of Vancouver argued the certificate should be quashed because it was based on a flawed report and approval from the National Energy Board that was later quashed by the Federal Court of Appeal.   After the National Energy Board reviewed the project for a second time, the federal government again approved the $7.4-billion expansion of the pipeline that runs from Alberta to the B.C. coast.  The B.C. Court of Appeal did not opt to quash the provincial certificate and instead said it's ""remitting"" it back to the province to reconsider, ""in light of the changes in the National Energy Board's report.""  The court ruled against the parties on the other argument put forward regarding duty to consult. The court found that the province met its duty to consult with the Squamish Nation on the project.  The question of consultation is still before the courts at the federal level and the legal actions include several B.C. First Nations.     In its 2017 certificate for the project B.C. placed 37 conditions on Trans Mountain — conditions that are beyond the 156 placed on the Crown corporation by the National Energy Board. It will be up to the province now to decide how it reviews those conditions and if amendments or additions are made.  Squamish spokesperson calls on B.C. to 'respect Indigenous rights'  Reacting to the court's decision on Tuesday, Squamish Nation spokesperson Khelsilem called on the province to put its words about reconciliation into action.   ""Premier Horgan and his government need to set the bar higher and rethink their approach to the TMX Project, and truly respect Indigenous rights by jointly reviewing with the Squamish Nation and other concerned First Nations whose territories would be directly impacted by the pipeline expansion,"" he wrote in a statement.     The City of Vancouver said in an emailed statement that it's pleased to see the court partially allowed its challenge to the certificate.   ""The City remains of the view that the Trans Mountain Pipeline project would have significant environmental impacts, including the unacceptable risk of oil spills and increased greenhouse gas emissions related to the project at a time when the world needs to reduce emissions,"" a spokesperson wrote.   Eugene Kung, a lawyer with West Coast Environmental Law who has been involved in several challenges to the pipeline expansion, said it's unclear what changes will result from this decision. He said that if B.C. amends or adds to the conditions in its certificate, it could have an impact on things like construction permitting.   ""B.C. now has an opportunity to put in place some protections for the province that they have been so vocal about... as long as those are within provincial jurisdiction and related to some of the new information provided by the NEB in the reconsideration, I think all of that is fair game,"" Kung said.   B.C. says it will 'take every measure available' in response to decision   B.C. Minister of Environment George Heyman said the decision is still being studied but that the provincial government remains committed to ""take every measure available to us to protect B.C.'s interests.""  Heyman said any amendments or additions to the conditions in its environmental assessment certificate will happen in consultation with Indigenous groups.   ""That is our constitutional legal duty and one of course we take seriously, given our commitment to the U.N. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples,"" he said.    In an emailed statement, Trans Mountain said the current certificate remains in place and that it is continuing with construction and planning of the expansion and is committed to building it ""in a manner that minimizes impacts to the environment and respects the values and priorities of Canadians.""  ""The court invited the B.C. government to review the [NEB report] amendments ... to determine whether they impact the provincial conditions that are placed on the project. The court affirmed the province is limited to making adjustments or additions to the provincial marine conditions and must do so within the limited scope of provincial authority over marine issues.""",business
230,"From book to ballet: Anne of Green Gables ballet set to tour Canada, U.S.","L.M. Montgomery's Anne of Green Gables was published in 1908 and was an immediate critical and commercial success. Over the past 111 years, it's been a cultural touchstone both at home in Canada and around the world.  The novel has been adapted numerous times — Canadians who grew up in the 1980s and 1990s will remember Megan Follows's turn as the iconic red-headed orphan. Prince Edward Island has been running a musical version for a staggering 55 consecutive summers. CBC's own Anne with an E begins its third season on Sept. 22, 2019.     Watch Anne with an E on CBC Gem    Now, for the first time ever, Anne of Green Gables is being adapted into a full-length ballet by Canada's Ballet Jörgen.    Turning Anne into a ballet  Anne of Green Gables is the story of an orphan who comes to live with siblings Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert in the fictional town of Avonlea in Prince Edward Island. An unusually outspoken and poetic girl, Anne is, at first, unwelcome in the quiet community. But the very traits that paint her as an outcast eventually win the town over.  Ballet Jörgen spent three years securing the rights to mount their own adaptation.  Except for a one-act version staged by the Royal Winnipeg Ballet in 1989, this marks the ballet debut of Anne of Green Gables.  ""Anne is a very vivacious character and it lends itself very well to dance,"" said Bengt Jörgen, company founder and choreographer. ""You'd be hard-pressed to find a better character to put into dance.""      Anne is a very vivacious character and it lends itself very well to dance.  - Bengt Jörgen, choreographer     Turning Anne Shirley into a dancer is what Hannah Mae Cruddas has been working on for months. The Nova Scotia dancer read the books as an eight-year-old and has been in love with the story ever since.  ""I reread it and dog-eared all the pages where L.M. Montgomery talks about the physicality of Anne… the way she holds her body,"" said Cruddas.  ""There are a few moments where they talk about Anne clasping her hands in front of her or lifting her eyes skyward. I can use those moments from the book in my movement. That was my research.""    Cruddas isn't the only cast member who discovered the book as a kid. Hiroto Saito, who is working on the roles of Matthew Cuthbert and Mr. Phillips, remembers reading the story growing up in Japan. His mother is such a huge fan of the books that she will be making the trip from Japan to Halifax to attend the show's premiere on Sept. 28.  ""It's a little different than a classical ballet because the characters are fairly young, so the movement is a little more energetic and explosive. It's very unique and it's quite exciting to see what's going on. I can't wait to see the final result,"" said Saito.     Love Anne with an E? The cast and showrunner have some book recommendations!    The famous scene    One of the most memorable moments from the book — and all its subsequent retellings — is the moment Anne loses her temper and smashes a slate over the head of Gilbert Blythe.  It's the beginning of a feud that will simmer for the rest of the story. The scene also serves as a benchmark for how much room Anne and Gilbert have to grow as characters.  In the novel, it's a comedic moment as much as a powerful one, and that's how Ballet Jörgen has chosen to approach it as well.  Daniel Da Silva is playing Gilbert Blythe and so far doesn't mind getting hit in the head over and over again.  ""Those kinds of scenes are really hard to do because the timing is really important,"" said Da Silva, who grew up in São Paulo, Brazil.  ""If it's not quite right with the music or if I flinch before the slate hits me in the head, it doesn't work.""     75 facts you might not know about Anne of Green Gables and Lucy Maud Montgomery    The biggest tour to date  Ballet Jörgen, whose mandate is to ""tell Canadian stories,"" is comprised of young dancers from Canada, Brazil, Japan, Mexico, the U.S. and the U.K. The cast of Anne of Green Gables features 20 dancers, all of whom will play multiple roles.  Jörgen, along with stage director Heinar Piller and set and costume designer Sue Lepage, have created 22 dance scenes to tell a 342-page story.  Orchestrator Alexander Levkovich adapted Norman Campbell's score from Anne of Green Gables – The Musical™ for the ballet.    The company's tour will bring them to small towns and cities across Canada and the U.S. It's already their biggest tour ever, with plans to extend it to 2021.  Here are the Canadian dates planned so far. The complete list of tour dates is available on Ballet Jörgen's website.  Nova Scotia     Sept. 28-29, 2019 — Halifax   April 14, 2020 — Mabou, N.S.

23,Toronto Public Health calling on province to end non-medical exemptions for vaccines in schools,"Toronto's medical officer of health is calling on the province to stop allowing children in Ontario schools to skip vaccines for non-medical reasons — but so far, Premier Doug Ford's government doesn't plan on changing the approach.  In a new report released on Monday, Dr. Eileen de Villa recommends Health Minister Christine Elliott consider changing the Immunization of School Pupils Act to only accept medical exemptions from a certified health-care provider.  ""Before philosophical and religious exemption rates reach dangerously high levels in Toronto, it is important and timely for the provincial Ministry of Health to consider removing philosophical and religious exemptions from its legislation,"" de Villa wrote in the report.  It's a controversial suggestion that comes against a backdrop of plummeting vaccination rates in areas around the world and instances of disease outbreaks in cities across Canada and the United States.  For Toronto students, there has been steady increase in philosophical and religious exemptions over the last decade and a bit, de Villa notes. Those increased from 0.8 per cent for the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine in the 2006 to 2007 school year to 1.72 per cent last year.  The rising non-medical exemption rates elsewhere have led to major outbreaks of multiple vaccine-preventable diseases such as whooping cough and measles.       Several outbreaks have been reported in Canada throughout 2019, including a measles outbreak in the Montreal area in June.  And in the U.S., more than 1,200 cases of measles have been confirmed in 31 states this year alone, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) — the highest number of cases reported in the U.S. since 1992.  ""The majority of cases are among people who were not vaccinated against measles,"" the CDC noted.  Amid that outbreak, New York State eliminated the area's religious exemption to vaccine requirements for schoolchildren earlier this year, with Democratic Sen. Brad Hoylman calling the situation an ""unprecedented public health crisis.""  'No plans' to update approach: health ministry  Toronto's board of health chair Joe Cressy said de Villa's recommendations are meant to be proactive.  ""This is based on science, and it's based on population health,"" he said. ""A lot of people are at risk if we don't have herd immunity.""      But a spokesperson for Elliott's office said there are ""no plans"" to update the province's approach.  Currently, under the Immunization of School Pupils Act, children are required to have proof of immunization for certain diseases to attend school in Ontario, unless there is a ""valid medical exemption or affidavit of conscience or religious belief,"" the health ministry's Travis Kann noted in a statement.  Pushback to that policy has been rising in recent years.    In 2016, the Canadian Medical Association passed a motion to back the end of non-medical exemptions in Ontario and the other two Canadian provinces — Manitoba and New Brunswick — which have similar mandatory vaccination laws for schoolchildren.  Other provinces and territories leave those decisions up to individual schools or school boards.  Ottawa-based physician Dr. Kumanan Wilson said public health teams should be guiding the discussion, but he stressed the complicated nature of changing the rules and suggested a limited policy — one that is re-evaluated later — could be the best interim approach for the province.  ""It's not a light undertaking to remove the ability of parents to make decisions regarding the health care of their children,"" Wilson said. ""However, if public health circumstances require it, sometimes these types of decisions need to be made.""  Kann said in Ontario, helping parents make ""informed"" choices is part of the process. Since 2017, parents have been required to complete an education session before submitting a request for a non-medical exemption.      De Villa agrees education is crucial.   ""Vaccine hesitancy, the reluctance or refusal to vaccinate despite the availability of vaccines, is a growing concern in Canada,"" she wrote in the report. ""It stems, in large part, from misinformation about vaccines that spreads on social media platforms and the Internet.""  Her other recommendations include calling for major online media companies — including Facebook, Google and Twitter — to better regulate vaccine misinformation.  De Villa is also calling on the board of health to request all Toronto school boards and the Ministry of Education to adopt curriculum on vaccines and vaccine-preventable diseases for all elementary schools.  Her recommendations will be considered by the board on Sept. 23.",health
87,"Proposed settlement with U.S. opioid-maker should include Canadian claims, B.C. government says","The British Columbia government says any proposed settlement from opioid manufacturer Purdue Pharma needs to include Canadian claims for the devastation created by the overdose crisis.  Purdue, the maker of the pain drug OxyContin, has filed for bankruptcy in the United States and proposed a multibillion-dollar plan to settle with thousands of state and local governments.  B.C. Attorney General David Eby said Monday the province has been monitoring the developments, including a tentative agreement that proposes to resolve the claims with Purdue, which is owned by the Sackler family.  Purdue Pharma Canada says in a statement it is a separate company from the U.S. firm and the actions taken to settle litigation in America don't directly affect its business in Canada.    Eby said the province remains ""ready and willing'' to participate in the effort to achieve a resolution but if B.C. is not included in the process then the government will continue its lawsuit, which names Purdue and several other opioid makers as defendants.  ""To date there has been no effort on the part of Purdue entities and the Sacklers to involve Canadian jurisdictions in the discussions that have led to the rumoured settlement in the U.S.,'' Eby said in a statement.    The province filed a proposed class-action lawsuit a year ago alleging drug manufactures falsely marketed opioids as less addictive than other pain medicines, triggering an overdose crisis that has killed thousands.  None of the allegations have been tested in court.    A statement of defence from Purdue Pharma could not be found on the B.C. Supreme Court website on Monday. Purdue Pharma has previously said that it followed all of Health Canada's regulations, including those governing marketing, and it's very concerned about the opioid crisis in B.C. and across Canada.  The pharmaceutical giant filed for bankruptcy late Sunday, step one in a plan it says would provide $10-$12 billion US to help reimburse state and local governments over overdose deaths.  The plan calls for turning Purdue into a ""public benefit trust'' that would continue selling opioids but hand its profits over to those who have sued the company. The Sackler family would give up ownership of Purdue and contribute at least $3 billion toward the settlement.    It will be up to a federal bankruptcy judge to decide whether to approve or reject the settlement or seek modifications.  Two dozen states plus key lawyers who represent many of the 2,000-plus local governments suing the Connecticut-based company have signed on to the plan.  But other states have come out strongly against it, arguing that it won't provide as much money as promised.",health
24,Omega-3: The treatment in search of an illness makes a comeback,"This is an excerpt from Second Opinion, a weekly roundup of eclectic and under-the-radar health and medical science news emailed to subscribers every Saturday morning. If you haven't subscribed yet, you can do that by clicking here.    Chances are you or someone you know, at some point, has popped a few of those honey-yellow gel capsules containing omega-3 fatty acids — likely in the name of good heart health.  The nutritional benefits of eating fatty fish — such as salmon, mackerel or tuna — have long been known. And there are entire generations of people who have fond memories of downing spoonfuls of cod liver oil.  That faith in fish oils has certainly been healthy for the bottom line of producers of omega-3 supplements — a global market valued at $3 billion.  And the scientific study of the benefits of omega-3 supplements also seems like an industry in itself, with more than 3,000 clinical trials alone registered at the esteemed Cochrane Library, a collection of medical and health-care databases.  This body of research tests hypotheses that the anti-inflammatory benefits of omega-3 could be used to treat or prevent an incredibly wide range of conditions, including ADHD, breast cancer, heart disease, high cholesterol, HIV, diabetes (Types 1 and 2), Tourette's syndrome, suicide and mania.    But when teams of researchers scrutinize the most reliable of these studies and put them together — known as meta-analyses — they conclude the treatment potential of these supplements is minimal to nil. Or, in a few cases, inconclusive.  (Reducing the risk of preterm births is perhaps the exception.)  But the 10 per cent of Canadian adults who take an omega-3 supplement might feel some vindication after a new review of all these meta-analyses concludes omega-3 can further reduce the symptoms of depression when taken in conjunction with antidepressants.  'Wasting money' on supplements  This ""meta-analysis of meta-analyses"" of randomized controlled trials — published in the journal World Psychiatry — examined the efficacy of the most popular and promising nutritional supplements, such as vitamins B, D, E, zinc, omega-3, probiotics and magnesium.  All of these are supplements targeted in a scathing 2013 editorial published by high-profile medical researchers in the Annals of Internal Medicine, titled Enough Is Enough: Stop Wasting Money on Vitamin and Mineral Supplements.  And it's likely no surprise that most supplements didn't fare as well as omega-3, which had ""the most consistent evidence we found across all the different supplements,"" said study co-author Brendon Stubbs, of King's College London.  But how did Stubbs and his colleagues find a new treatment potential for omega-3, when past reviews didn't?  ""There's rapidly growing interest in the field … so the evidence is constantly evolving,"" said Stubbs, adding that his team reviewed the most up-to-date studies in the field.    But he also noted more research is needed to determine what exactly is at play when it comes to omega-3.  The last five years have seen a resurgence of interest in fish oils, largely in a specific fatty acid found in omega-3 — eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). University of Toronto nutrition sciences professor Richard Bazinet said this latest review has validated that emerging literature.  ""When they separated the studies out by the ones that use mostly EPA, they are the ones that seem to be showing promise or are working,"" he said. ""That's what the study is reconfirming.""    EPA's most exciting development came in January, when a five-year study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that heart patients who were taking a prescription form of EPA, along with their other medications, lowered their risk of a cardiovascular event, such as heart attack or stroke.  The manufacturers of omega-3 supplements were more than just cheering from the sidelines; they used the findings to promote their own products.  'War' over omega-3  ""It created a bit of a war because a lot of the supplement companies said, 'Hey, look what EPA does. Our product has EPA.' And the drug company turned around said 'No, no, no. We're a drug. We're FDA approved. You can't use our research to support your product,'"" said Bazinet.  The pharmaceutical company which produced the EPA-derived drug, Amarin, had a point. Its product wasn't straight-up EPA from omega-3 supplements that could be bought from your local store: it was a concentrated derivative of EPA.  Amarin took two supplement-makers to court and eventually settled.    So that's the catch, so to speak, with fish oils. It's likely these pure forms of EPA that are the future of omega-3 research, Bazinet said, and not necessarily over-the-counter supplements.  It's also worth noting that any benefit demonstrated by EPA — be it cardiovascular or psychological — has only happened when it's taken alongside conventional pharmaceutical drugs.  Still, omega-3 isn't likely to win over physicians who often find themselves deprescribing supplements for their patients.    Dr. Samir Sinha, a Toronto geriatrician, said omega-3 is one of the most popular supplements he's regularly telling his elderly patients they can stop taking.  ""When I tell them these haven't been shown to be helpful, a lot of patients thank me,'' Sinha said. ""Because I say, 'By getting rid of all of these things, I've just saved you a bucket-load of money.'""  As for Bazinet, whose own nutrition research examines aspects of fish oils' effects on the brain, he also doesn't bother with omega-3 supplements, preferring to get his intake straight from the source.  ""I happen to walk by a fish shop every night on the way home,"" he said. ""[Sometimes] I enjoy a nice fish meal.""

58,Reaction to Trudeau's blackface runs from 'This can't be real' to 'I didn't really care' ,"Toronto resident Marcus Vanderwyck, a first-time voter, was set to walk into a voting booth next month and pencil an X beside the Liberal candidate in his Toronto riding, a show of support for Justin Trudeau.  But since the photos of the Liberal leader dressed in brownface and blackface emerged on Wednesday night, he has changed his mind.  ""It's changing my whole perspective,"" he said. ""I'm probably going to vote NDP.""    He learned about the pictures while on Instagram, saying that at first, he didn't believe what he was seeing.  ""I was like, this can't be real. Then it started getting into the news more and more and I was like 'Wow,  this is unbelievable'.""  'I really didn't care'  But not everyone interviewed by CBC News in St. James Town in Toronto shared Vanderwyck's views.   ""Personally for me, I really didn't care,"" said Lance Manning,  who works in the area but lives in Brampton. ""Some of my friends were really offended, but when it comes to my mindset, I focus on intent. How he dressed, was there any malicious thought behind it? And my conclusion is, that it isn't.""    Trudeau has publicly apologized twice since three pictures and a video of him in either brownface or blackface have come to light.  On Wednesday night, Time magazine published an article showing Trudeau wearing brownface makeup and a turban for a 2001 Arabian Nights gala at the Vancouver private school where he taught. Since then, CBC News obtained another photo of Trudeau from that event.  Meanwhile, another picture shows Trudeau at a talent show when he was in high school, wearing black makeup and singing the Banana Boat Song (Day-O), a Jamaican folk tune made famous by black American singer Harry Belafonte   'Making things hard on himself'  Then, on Thursday, the Liberal Party confirmed Trudeau appeared in a short amateur video in blackface.  Manning hadn't seen that image of Trudeau, until shown it by CBC News.     ""Oh boy,"" he said, after studying the image. ""He's making things hard on himself. He definitely should be more mindful of that kind of stuff.""  While he's still undecided as to who he will vote for and has voted Liberal in the past, Manning said the pictures won't likely affect his decision.  ""I like the Liberal party, I like the Trudeau family. His father did a lot for the black community and immigrants migrating to Canada, so I take all that stuff into consideration.  ""Will do more researching, but I'm always open to forgiving. People make mistakes in life.""    Muhammad Suhail, shown the pictures for the first time, said he couldn't understand why they had generated so much controversy and condemnation.  ""Why are people upset from that? Maybe he was trying to play, like an actor on stage. I'm OK with that.""  Bhavani Mohanadhas also said that she believes Trudeau is a ""good Liberal"" and that she doesn't feel he's ""doing any racism"".  I have been following [him]. He is everywhere supporting other people, different races.""     Brooks Smith said he was surprised by Trudeau's past behaviour, calling it ""a little disgracing.""  ""That really hurts, that really hurt, because I'm black. And you'd think he''d have more sense than that. You'd think he'd be a little smarter than that.""  Still vote for Trudeau  But Smith said he will still vote for Trudeau, that people make mistakes when they're younger.   ""If this were recently, I'd feel more against him.""    However, Andrew Ravindran wasn't as forgiving, saying that when he learned the news from Facebook, it was an ""Are you kidding me?"" moment.   He said he believes many people continue to dress in ""Arabian Night"" or Aladdin costumes.     It's really annoying,""he said.  ""I 'm brown so it's a little hard to be used to it. It's just stupid.""  Ravindran said he believes Trudeau has likely learned his lesson, but should have known better.  Asked to explain why he found Trudeau's brownface costume so offensive, Ravindran gave a succinct answer:   ""He's not brown.""",politics
239,Conservative riding association takes down fake meme of Rick Mercer endorsing party,"A Facebook post by a Conservative riding association in British Columbia spreading disinformation about Canadian comedian Rick Mercer has been removed.  The meme took an authentic Mercer quote about the importance of voting, but changed the final part of the quote from ""Vote"" to ""Vote Conservative.""  If the intent of the post was to trick people into believing Mercer was rooting for the party's candidate in Burnaby North—Seymour, it might have worked on some voters. But if the goal was to make Mercer laugh, it definitely worked.  ""It's completely bizarre,"" he told CBC News on Tuesday evening. ""I'm not angry. I was more amused than anything.""  Mercer took to Twitter to ask the party to remove the post. As of Tuesday evening, it was no longer showing on the Burnaby North Seymour Conservative Constituency Association page.  Before it was deleted, the caption on the post said ""wise words.""    Mercer said he was alerted to it by some friends and other people on social media who spotted the dishonesty in the quote.  ""I was always careful not to say, you know, which party you should vote for. I would never do that,"" Mercer said in an interview. ""It's weird that people will think in this day and age that you can get away with that.""  In a federal campaign where people have gotten in trouble for far more controversial social media posts, Mercer said he's not upset about it and he doesn't expect a response from Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, or anyone else for that matter.      I don't know what I'd be doing weighing into the local politics in Burnaby.  - Rick Mercer     He's just left scratching his head about who thought it would be a good idea to manipulate his quote.  ""There's a lot of very odd people running in this election for all the parties. I mean that's what you've gotta ask yourself, like what kind of person does that? It's just a very strange thing to do.""  It's especially strange given the fact he's from St. John's, on the opposite end of the country.  ""I don't know what I'd be doing weighing into the local politics in Burnaby, British Columbia.""  Heather Leung is the Conservative candidate for the riding. She's going up against Liberal Terry Beech, the Green Party's Amita Kuttner, New Democrat Svend Robinson and People's Party of Canada candidate Rocky Dong.

209,Millions in 150 countries protest for climate action,"Millions were taking to the streets in roughly 150 countries around the world on Friday for a global strike demanding world leaders gathering at a UN climate summit adopt urgent measures to avert an environmental catastrophe.  The protests kicked off in the Pacific islands — some of the nations most threatened by rising sea levels — and Australia, where social media posts showed huge demonstrations around the country, from the big coastal cities of Melbourne and Sydney to outback towns such as Alice Springs.   The worldwide strike was inspired by 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg.  Thunberg, who soared into prominence after sailing across the Atlantic in an emissions-free yacht ahead of the summit, was in New York to headline a massive rally in Lower Manhattan ahead of next week's climate summit at the headquarters of the United Nations.    The co-ordinated student ""strike"" culminated in New York's financial centre, Wall Street, where some investors have embraced the fossil fuel industry.  Massive crowds overwhelmed the streets of lower Manhattan, letting out roars of ""Save our planet,"" while anticipating an address by Thunberg.  ""Right now, we are the ones who are making a difference. If no one else will take action, then we will,"" Thunberg told demonstrators in New York.  ""We demand a safe future. Is that really too much to ask?"" she said.    New York City officials estimated that 60,000 people marched there.   Global climate campaign group 350.org said Friday afternoon that organizers estimated more than four million people had taken to the streets. About 3,000 companies closed their doors in support of the climate strikes, it said.  The protests, in advance of a UN summit Monday aimed at accelerating action to tackle global warming, kicked off a week in which more than 5,800 climate change-related strikes and other events are set to take place in 163 countries, 350.org said in a statement.  Britain's Opposition Leader Jeremy Corbyn tweeted that 100,000 people joined the demonstration in London.    ""Our future on your shoulders,"" read one banner stretched across a street by students in Berlin.    Protests extended beyond student-led demonstrations, with hundreds of Amazon workers walking out of their offices in Seattle, Wash. The employees held signs, some made from recycled Amazon boxes, that urged the company to stop dealing with oil and gas companies and to not make political contributions to people who deny climate change.  Amazon, which ships more than 10 billion items a year, vowed Thursday to cut its use of fossil fuels. It said it had ordered 100,000 electric vans to deliver packages beginning in 2021.  Employees of Google also participated in demonstrations, as about 60 gathered in downtown San Francisco and marched to join a larger, student-led climate strike in the city. One held a sign reading: ""Google Do Better.""     In Brazil, thousands mounted climate demonstrations of their own, largely aimed at President Jair Bolsonaro, whom they say is allowing fires to destroy the Amazon rainforest and worsen the environmental crisis. On Twitter, Brazilians tweeted #EleNao and #ForaSalles, calls to reject Bolsonaro and oust Environment Minister Ricardo Salles. Protesters criticized and mocked the two leaders with signs and costumes.  A few dozen people, mostly students, gathered on the steps of Rio de Janeiro's state assembly behind a banner reading ""climate justice.""  Global anxiety has focused on Brazil since August, when it was revealed fires in the Amazon have surged to their highest level since 2010. Many environmentalists blame Bolsonaro for policies they say favour development over environmental protections, and which have led to deforestation.  Salles told Reuters on Thursday that the majority of the Amazon remains intact, showing that Brazil is doing an ""excellent job"" to preserve the environment. He acknowledged the existence of manmade climate change, and said protesters are right to be concerned about the future.  ""I have children, and I am concerned about their future, too,"" he said in an interview.    In Europe, German Chancellor Angela Merkel unveiled a major new climate protection package thrashed out by parties in her coalition in all-night talks.  Meanwhile, on the streets of the capital, Berlin, crowds gathered at the Brandenburg Gate, where three activists stood on blocks of ice beneath a mock gallows.  ""A lot of people support our movement, but we want to go a step further, because politicians decide on our future,"" said Janik Oswald, a German spokesperson for Fridays for Future, the school strike movement started by Thunberg in Sweden last year. ""We urgently demand that something happens.""  'Not at all a nuisance,' Thai official says  The UN summit brings together world leaders to discuss climate change mitigation strategies, such as transitioning to renewable energy sources from fossil fuels.  The issue is vital to low-lying Pacific islands, which have repeatedly asked wealthier nations to do more to prevent rising sea levels.    Children in the Solomon Islands rallied on the shoreline wearing traditional grass skirts and carrying wooden shields in solidarity with the global movement.  In Thailand, more than 200 young people stormed into the Environment Ministry and dropped to the ground feigning death as they demanded government action on climate change.  ""This is what will happen if we don't stop climate change now,"" said 21-year-old strike organizer Nanticha Ocharoenchai.    The Thai Environment Ministry's deputy permanent secretary, Adisorn Noochdumrong, supported the students.  ""This is how the young people express their concerns, which we deem as a good sign and not at all a nuisance,"" he said.    In Palangka Raya, in Indonesia's Central Kalimantan province, youths carrying placards marched through heavy smog caused by forest fires.  In the eastern Indian city of Kolkata, around 25 school children handed out flyers at busy bus terminals and held placards that read ""Save Our Planet. Save Our World.""  ""This is the only planet we have. We wanted to stand for it before we went to school for the day,"" one of the children said.  'Chinese youth have their own methods'  Global warming caused by heat-trapping greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels has already led to droughts and heat waves, melting glaciers, rising sea levels and floods, scientists say.  Carbon emissions climbed to a record last year, despite a warning from the UN-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in October that output of the gases must be slashed over the next 12 years to stabilize the climate.    No protests were authorized in China, the world's biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions, but Zheng Xiaowen of the China Youth Climate Action Network said Chinese youth would take action one way or another.  ""Chinese youth have their own methods,"" she said. ""We also pay attention to the climate, and we are also thinking deeply, interacting, taking action, and so many people are very conscientious on this issue.""",technology
168,"Jeff Bezos makes climate pledge, after revealing Amazon emits as much carbon as a small nation","Online shopping giant Amazon revealed a carbon footprint Thursday that rivals that of a small country and CEO Jeff Bezos vowed to reduce the damage to the planet by cutting its use of fossil fuels.  The company, which ships more than 10 billion items a year on fuel-guzzling planes and trucks, said it has ordered 100,000 electric vans that will start delivering packages to shoppers' doorsteps in 2021. It also plans to have 100 per cent of its energy use come from solar panels and other renewable energy by 2030. That's up from 40 per cent today.  ""We've been in the middle of the herd on this issue and we want to move to the forefront,"" said Amazon founder Bezos. Bezos, who is also publisher of the Washington Post, made the climate pledge before the National Press Club in Washington.  The announcement came ahead of a walkout Friday by about 1,500 Amazon workers concerned over the company's impact on the climate. They are joining the Global Climate Strike, a worldwide climate change protest.  As much carbon as a small nation  Amazon said it emitted 44.4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide last year, a number that comes close to pollution rates of some small nations.  ""Its greenhouse gas emissions are about 85 per cent of the emissions of Switzerland or Denmark,"" said Gregg Marland, a professor at the Research Institute for Environment, Energy and Economics at Appalachian State University.    Amazon's employees have pressured the company to do more to combat climate change. Earlier this year, more than 8,000 Amazon staffers signed an open letter to Bezos, demanding that Amazon cut its carbon emissions, end its use of fossil fuels and stop working with oil companies who use Amazon's technology to find drillable oil faster.  Amazon plans to be carbon neutral by 2040 and wants other companies to join it. Bezos unveiled a climate pledge and said he would talk with CEOs of other large companies to get them to sign it.  ""We want to use our scale and our scope to lead the way,"" Bezos said.  Employees laud climate pledge  A climate change advocacy group founded by Amazon workers said the company's announcement amounted to a ""huge win"" and proved that employee pressure works. In a statement, Amazon Employees For Climate Justice said that it would keep pushing the issue as long as Amazon continues working with oil and gas companies and donating to politicians who deny climate change.  Bezos defended Amazon's work with the oil and gas industry, arguing that ""we need to help them instead of vilify them,"" and said Amazon would take a ""hard look"" at campaign contributions to climate deniers. However, he stopped short of saying such donations would stop.  Employees from other big tech giants, including Google and Microsoft, also planned to walk out on Friday. Their gripes mirror those of Amazon's employees, including that their companies provide technology to the oil industry. Ahead of the strikes, Google made its own announcement Thursday, saying it would buy enough renewable energy to spur the construction of millions of solar panels and hundreds of wind turbines across the world.  'Comprehensive' carbon accounting  To measure its carbon footprint, Amazon looked at emissions from all of its businesses, including the planes it operates and the energy it uses to make Echos, Kindles and its other devices. Amazon even included customers' trips to Whole Foods, the grocery chain it owns.  ""It's very comprehensive,"" said Beril Toktay, professor of operations and supply chain management at Georgia Tech's Scheller College of Business. She said she would like to see Amazon include the carbon footprint of the products it sells on its website, which could help drive people to shop for items that are less damaging to the environment.    Robin Bell, a research professor at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, said it was exciting to see Amazon taking meaningful steps to reduce its carbon footprint.  ""They're blazing a trail for other companies to follow suit,"" Bell said.",business
215,"Emmy Awards: Surprises, upsets and memorable moments","A new queen of comedy, surprising upsets, a history-making award and the inevitable win for Game of Thrones: the 2019 Emmy Awards offered night of wins as fractured as the current TV landscape.  The hostless, three-hour show was both funny and head-scratching, depending on what point you tuned in.     Producers won some solid laughs by putting reliable performers such as Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Maya Rudolph and late-night hosts Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel onstage, but the decision to dispense with traditional voiceover narration and orchestra playing people onstage (in favour of comedian Thomas Lennon's commentary and contemporary tracks) made for some awkward moments.   Here are some Emmy highlights in a night dominated by wins for cable network HBO and streaming platforms Amazon and Netflix:  Fleabag's wins  Phoebe Waller-Bridge was the giant-slayer Sunday night, with the British writer, performer and creator scoring three trophies for her critically acclaimed Amazon series Fleabag, a dark comedy centred on what she called a ""dirty, pervy, messed up,"" London woman navigating life after tragedy.    Waller-Bridge won best writing in a comedy series early on, and eventually added best comedy and best lead actress in a comedy. The latter two categories were widely expected to go to the beloved and recently concluded satire Veep and its star Louis-Dreyfus. Waller-Bridge's wins in those categories blocked the Seinfeld alum from becoming the most decorated Emmy winner ever. Fleabag also won for its direction.   ""This is just getting ridiculous,"" the thoroughly delighted Brit declared upon winning the penultimate award of the night.    She also gets bonus points for her ties to another surprise winner: Waller-Bridge got a shout-out from Killing Eve's Jodie Comer (who won over her co-star, Canadian Sandra Oh, in the best lead actress in a drama category). Waller-Bridge served as head writer of the spy thriller's first season.  'I have the right to be here'  A striking addition to any red carpet, Billy Porter from FX's ball culture drama Pose made history as the first openly gay man to win the Emmy for best lead actor in a drama series. In his acceptance speech, he delivered a message that was both exuberant and powerful.    ""It took many years of vomiting up all the filth I'd been taught about myself, and half-believed, before I was able to walk on the earth as though I had a right to be here,"" Porter said, quoting writer and activist James Baldwin.  ""I have the right. You have the right. We all have the right.""  Sunday night's Emmy also puts the previous Tony- and Grammy-winner on the path toward EGOT status, with just an Academy Award left for Porter to win.  [PHOTOGALLERY]  'Listen to her'  It wouldn't be an award show without performers making impassioned pleas (Patricia Arquette took time to call out the persecution of trans people, while RuPaul urged Americans to vote). Fosseu002FVerdon star Michelle Williams addressed the issue of pay equity in accepting her award for best actress in a limited series or TV movie.  ""I see this [award] as an acknowledgement of what is possible when a woman is trusted to discern her own needs, feels safe enough to voice them, and respected enough that they will be heard,"" she said, adding that Fosseu002FVerdon's network FX ""understood that when you put value into a person, it empowers that person to get in touch with their own inherent value.    ""And where do they put that value? They put it into their work. And so when the next woman and especially a woman of colour — because she stands to make 52 cents on the dollar compared to her white, male counterpart — tells you what she needs in order to do her job: listen to her. Believe her.""   In 2017, the four-time Oscar nominee made headlines when it emerged that her All the Money in the World co-star Mark Wahlberg received $1.5 million (all figures U.S.) to do re-shoots for the drama, while she received less than $1,000.   ""The discrepancy … was so huge that it really illustrated a larger point. Not just for myself, obviously, but if it was this difficult for me — a white woman in a privileged industry — how difficult is it for women of colour across all industries?"" Williams added backstage in the Emmys press room.  ""While tonight is a kind of fairy-tale ending for me and for my own personal story, there really won't be any satisfaction for me until the larger message is heard.  The Exonerated Five  The Microsoft Theater erupted in cheers and a standing ovation when Jharrel Jerome was announced winner of best lead actor in a limited series for When They See Us, Ava DuVernay's series on the infamous Central Park Five case, in which five black and Latino teens were coerced into confessing to a rape they didn't commit.    The memorable Emmys moment acknowledged both young rising star Jerome's performance in the searing Netflix four-parter as well as the five exonerated men, who attended the awards show alongside Duvernay.  ""This is for Raymond, Yusef, Antron, Kevin, and King Korey Wise,"" Jerome declared.     'We shall never see its like again'  Perhaps an acknowledgement of the divisive final season of Game of Thrones, the sprawling fantasy epic didn't set a new record with how many trophies it added to its already mammoth haul for the previous seven seasons. Its dozen wins this year, largely awarded during last week's Creative Arts Emmys, tied the show's previous record for most Emmys won by a series in a single season.  Best writing and direction in a drama series — two major awards Game of Thrones has claimed in the past — went to HBO's Succession and Netflix's Ozark (respectively) in 2019.    Even the decision to unite the cast as Emmy presenters didn't go over as well as expected, with superfans noting the clutch of GoT actors at the ceremony not invited to share the stage.     Still, the legacy of the game-changing HBO series (and Peter Dinklage's indelible performance) proved insurmountable: the show was crowned best drama series and Dinklage picked up a fourth acting Emmy.  ""These last ten years have been the best years of our lives,"" showrunner David Benioff declared onstage.  ""I can't believe we finished it. I can't believe we did it all together and it's over. We shall never see its like again.""  And while ""You know nothing, Jon Snow"" became a popular Game of Thrones meme, the actor behind that character says he and his castmates knew the ending was right.    ""Everyone put all of their love and effort into [the final series],"" Kit Harington noted backstage.  ""I think for us, we knew what we were doing was right, story-wise. And that it was right for the characters because we lived with them for 10 years.""",entertainment
158,'We're ready for them:' Texans see opportunity in western Canadian malaise,"The brochure's cover has the Texas flag as a backdrop and shows an arrow pointing from Alberta to the Lone Star State.  ""Arrowstar Realty invites you to relocate to Texas,"" reads the mailer sent to businesses across Western Canada recently. ""Join the 100s of companies that have already made the move!""  Inside is a letter — beginning ""Dear Canadian Neighbour"" — boasting of Montgomery County's ""BOOMING"" economy, tax incentives and ranch-style properties. It offers to link prospective clients with banks, accountants and lawyers to ease their move.  Realtor Robert Graham says 15,000 brochures have been delivered in Alberta, Saskatchewan and British Columbia so far. Another 50,000 are coming.  40 companies in the past year and a half  He says Arrowstar has helped about 100 western Canadian companies move north of Houston in the last decade, and 40 of them were in the last year and a half.  The majority of newcomers have been Canadian oil and gas drillers.  ""I definitely want Canada to pick back up. I would love for that more than anything,"" says Graham.  But for now, he says, a lot of Canadian businesses need help to keep going.  ""We've got doors open and we're ready for them.""    Krisjan Jones, operations manager at livestock feed supplement maker Canadian Bio-Systems, says Lubbock's economic development agency recently made an enticing pitch to move his business to the west Texas city.  It was offering land at no cost with utilities and rail access.  ""So essentially you get a blank canvas for free,"" says Jones, who adds he's waiting on the outcome of the Oct. 21 federal election before pulling the trigger. He cites the federal carbon tax as a major issue for him.  Clogged railways that make it difficult to get international shipments out on time are another big knock against Canada, he says.  John Osborne with the Lubbock Economic Development Alliance says pitches are centred more on the long-term business case than politics or potential perks. When benefits are discussed, it's more of a problem-solving exercise.  ""We look at it as, 'What's stopping you from saying yes to coming to Lubbock right now?""'  Free land, road paving, sewer and water  That could mean free land, sewer and water hookups or road paving.  Osborne says his group has been doing Canadian outreach for about a decade, but it's gone from sporadic to regular in recent years.  Most trips are to Calgary and Toronto and have been with companies in oil and gas, manufacturing and agriculture.  Precision Drilling CEO Kevin Neveu moved to Houston from Calgary three years ago with the rest of the company's management team. It has about 250 employees in each city now.  Neveu says 2017 was the first year Canada made up less than half of Precision's activity and this year it's at 30 per cent.  Alberta's oil curtailments, trouble building new pipelines and cooling investor sentiment have depressed the Canadian industry, he says.  ""It's those three factors that are really starving our customers for capital, which means they're not reinvesting in drilling, which means that our business here is just really slow — brutally slow.""  Mark Scholz, head of the Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors, says every member he's spoken to has at least seriously considered moving people or equipment out of Canada.  The association represents more than 100 companies that drill or service oil and gas wells.  He says moves from Alberta's new United Conservative government to lessen the regulatory and tax burden are helping with competitiveness, but the southbound exodus is a wake-up call.  ""The Americans are playing a very strategic game and quite frankly I think they're winning at that.""",business
76,'This is really upsetting': Inconvenienced airline passengers struggle to get compensation under new rules,"Canada's new air passenger protection regulations promise up to $2,400 in compensation for customers denied boarding; however, some passengers have found that they need to do battle with their airline to collect their cash.   That was the case for Chelsea Williamson who finally got her denied boarding compensation from WestJet one week ago — only after complaining to the Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA).   ""[WestJet] called me, and they did say that they made a mistake,"" said Williamson, who lives in Edmonton. ""It stinks that they weren't willing to co-operate with me this way before I actually filed a complaint.""  The CTA reports it has received 147 passenger complaints concerning denied boarding issues since the new rules came into effect on July 15. Sixty-seven of the complaints involve Air Canada and 24 involve WestJet, while the rest are scattered among 27 other airlines.  Consumer advocate John Lawford said the complaints are inevitable, both because of airlines adjusting to the new rules, and what he believes is a reluctance among some carriers to embrace the regulations — which include hefty compensation for mishaps, such as lost baggage and flight delays.       It's early days, but I still see some reticence on the part of the airlines.  - John Lawford, executive director of Public Interest Advocacy Centre     ""It's early days, but I still see some reticence on the part of the airlines,"" said Lawford, executive director of the Public Interest Advocacy Centre.  'We failed to meet our obligations'  All the major Canadian airlines have told CBC News they intend to fully comply with the regulations.   But Williamson felt WestJet wasn't playing fair after she and her husband were bumped from their flight on July 22. Instead of receiving the $900 each in compensation they believed they were owed, the airline offered them $250 in travel vouchers.  The couple's journey began when they tried to board the first leg of their flight from Edmonton to Venice and were told that WestJet had switched the aircraft to a smaller one, so they had lost their confirmed seats.     ""We must have been at the bottom of their boarding priority list,"" said Williamson.   The newlyweds were on their honeymoon and, because they were put on a later flight, they arrived in Venice around five hours later than expected.    Under the new regulations, denied boarding passengers are entitled to $900 for a delay under six hours.  But when Williamson complained to WestJet by email and demanded compensation, she was told the couple didn't qualify because their rebooking was a pre-planned schedule change.   When Williamson argued that their ""schedule change"" occurred last-minute, the airline responded that it was actually classified as a flight delay or cancellation.      I was getting a different answer from WestJet every time I contacted them.  - Chelsea Williamson     ""I was getting a different answer from WestJet every time I contacted them.""  After filing the complaint, WestJet eventually paid Williamson and her husband $900 each and offered an apology.   ""Following an internal investigation, we recognized that we failed to meet our obligations to these guests,"" said spokesperson Morgan Bell in an email to CBC News.   Williamson's case has triggered a CTA investigation into whether WestJet's policies on flight changes comply with the new regulations. The airline said it's co-operating with the inquiry.     Show me the money  Marc Belanger of Prince George, B.C., also discovered collecting his compensation wasn't an easy process.   He and his wife were denied boarding on the first leg of their Air Canada flight from Prince George to Quebec City on July 19.  Because the plane was overbooked, and the two were put on a later flight — delaying their arrival by more than 13 hours — Air Canada promised them each $2,400 in compensation: the amount that must be paid when denied boarding passengers are delayed by more than nine hours.   ""I said, 'Oh, that's nice,'"" Belanger said.     But he began to lose faith when the money didn't materialize the following month. In mid-August, he said he complained by phone and by email to Air Canada, and when the cash still hadn't arrived by September, he contacted CBC News.  ""It's such a little amount of money for a company that size. I don't understand what the problem is,"" said Belanger. ""This is really upsetting.""  According to the new regulations, passengers must receive compensation within 48 hours of being denied boarding.      With any new regulations of such complexity it is only reasonable to expect that initially, in some cases, interpretation of the new rules and processing may sometimes take time.  - Peter Fitzpatrick, Air Canada spokesperson     Air Canada told CBC News that the compensation had been sent. Belanger did finally receive two cheques totalling  $4,800 on Monday — more than eight weeks after he and his wife were denied boarding.     ""I don't think it's acceptable,"" said Belanger, who believes that he may never have received the cash if he hadn't complained.  When asked about the delay in compensation, which contravenes the new rules, Air Canada responded that it's committed to full compliance, but that, inevitably, there'll be some hiccups as airlines adjust to the long list of regulations.   ""With any new regulations of such complexity it is only reasonable to expect that initially, in some cases, interpretation of the new rules and processing may sometimes take time,"" said spokesperson Peter Fitzpatrick, in an email.  More complaints to come?  Lawford believes the CTA will be swamped with complaints from passengers following the new regulations, the second part of which, covering delays and cancellations, take effect in mid-December.  To cope, he believes the agency needs to create a streamlined process to handle the deluge of unhappy passengers trying to collect their cash.  ""There has to be a very efficient, call-centre based, neutral section that does these complaints and is sitting there, waiting for them,"" Lawford said.",business
56,Justin Trudeau — a self-appointed moral steward in blackface: Robyn Urback,"It is almost too obvious now to point out the rank hypocrisy of the Trudeau brand: one that has zero tolerance for inappropriate touching, except for his own; one that preaches respect for Indigenous Canadians, except when you can get a cheap laugh at a Liberal fundraiser.   One that claims to run government differently, but uses the same old tactics to get its way; one that lectures about standing up to oppression, except oppression in certain ridings.   One that insists it is working in the interests of the average Canadian, but tries to curry favour with the above-average Canadian in private. One that renounces the politics of fear and division, except when the politics of fear and division can be politically advantageous.    And one that has spent its entire political existence proselytizing about tolerance, inclusivity, sensitivity and acceptance, all the while knowing — and hiding — a past that includes multiple instances of dressing up in blackface.   'Arabian Nights'  Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau made one good point while delivering his apology Wednesday, after Time magazine published a 2001 photo of him wearing brownface as a 29-year-old teacher at an Arabian Nights-themed school party.   ""If everyone who is going to be standing for office needs to demonstrate they've been perfect every step of their lives,"" Trudeau said, ""there is going to be a shortage of people running for office.""  Putting aside the enormous chasm between being ""perfect"" and wearing blackface three times, Trudeau makes a valid point about the need for a political machine that makes allowances for human flaws. If we don't allow people to grow and change, we end up with slates of sanitized candidates who planned their political careers from birth and wore suits to middle school, which is, without a doubt, a most hellish version of politics.   But Trudeau's argument would carry more weight had his war room not spent the week prior furiously digging up reasons why his opponents should be disqualified — reasons that include what they once said, once advocated for, or with whom they previously associated.  None of those claims were close to as bad as a grown man wearing blackface on multiple occasions. Had Trudeau been a regular candidate of any party, including the Liberals, he would've been closing up his campaign office by now.       Blackface scandal a 'painful' reminder of racism in Richmond, Va. — a city filled with reminders     Virginia's attorney general latest to admit to wearing blackface     Earlier this year, the United States was grappling with a political blackface scandal of its own: Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam was accused of wearing blackface in a 1984 yearbook photo.  That was the time, if ever, for Trudeau to own his actions, instead of being cornered into acknowledging them, as he has been now.  Instead, Trudeau carried on as if — to borrow his own words — he had been perfect every step of his life, with the Liberals then launching a co-ordinated attack on the Conservatives, accusing them of being soft on white supremacy.  Knowing what we know now, if you imagine Trudeau wearing black makeup and singing Day O while accusing Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer of refusing to take racism seriously, the attack loses its potency.     There is no question that the revelations of the last 24 hours are shocking, and that they could very well shift the direction of the federal election campaign.  But at the same time, for those familiar with the ways the karma gods of politics operate, they are wholly unsurprising, particularly considering the cracks in the Trudeau brand that have given way thus far.  It follows that the politician who preaches most about loving his wife probably loves his mistress more, and the one who rails against gay marriage would never do so in front of his secret male lover. The most sanctimonious of leaders are so often the sinners.   And Justin Trudeau is a perfect example: a self-appointed moral steward in a turban and dark makeup.  When you run on sanctimony, govern on arrogance and expect perfection, you find yourself in an awful quandary when you fall short of your own standards.  Each Canadian will decide for themselves whether Trudeau's actions — and failure to disclose those actions — warrant forgiveness. But his days as a progressive icon — the one who quipped ""Because it's 2015"" when asked why he prioritized gender parity in his cabinet, and boasted that ""Canada is back"" after his election — are over.   Trudeau truly has done some important, progressive things for Canada: from opening the door to those fleeing violence and persecution, to putting climate at the forefront of our national agenda (however lacklustre his actual policies might be). But from now on, Trudeau will never be able to separate his record from a few photos of him participating in a racist, ignorant, foolish act.   Maybe that's unfair.

In 2016, the Prince Albert, Sask., nurse was found guilty of professional misconduct by the Saskatchewan Registered Nurses Association after a 2015 post she made on Facebook, criticizing the health care her grandfather received.  She was ordered to pay a $1,000 fine and $25,000 to cover the cost of the tribunal.  ""It's been a roller-coaster,"" said Strom. ""It's been really stressful. I didn't ever imagine that it would go on this long.""  On Tuesday morning, Strom will be at the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in Regina to fight the association's decision as well as a provincial Court of Queen's Bench decision that ruled against her last year.   The professional charges stemmed from a February 2015 Facebook post in which Strom criticized the care her grandfather received while in palliative care at St. Joseph's Integrated Health Centre in the town of Macklin, about 225 kilometres west of Saskatoon.  ""It is evident that not everyone is 'up to speed' on how to approach end of life care ... or how to help maintain an aging senior's dignity (among other things!),"" read part of the Facebook post.  ""To those who made Grandpa's last year's less than desirable, please do better next time!""     Some of the nurses in the hospital felt Strom's post was a personal attack and complained. The SRNA ruled the post brought the nursing profession into disrepute and violated its social media policy.  Strom refused to drop the case and held to it as a matter of principle. She was ordered to write an essay explaining what she did wrong, and refused to do so.  She believes her case has had a chilling effect on other nurses speaking out across the province.  ""My fear is that things aren't getting reported. Things aren't changing,"" she said.   ""People are afraid to to address concerns, and that's not helping anybody, especially the people with family members that are in hospital.""  'Don't speak out'  The case generated public outrage, with many advocates speaking out on Strom's behalf.  ""If what she said is deemed by the regulator to be somehow crossing a line, then I think we're all in pretty deep trouble,"" said Steven Lewis, a Saskatoon-based health-care policy analyst.  ""They're essentially sending the message, 'Don't speak out on anything.'""    Several groups, including the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association and the Canadian Constitution Foundation, have received intervenor status in the case, testifying on Strom's behalf.    Lewis noted that Strom's comment did not single out any particular person, and was talking about the care her grandfather received in a facility hundreds of kilometres away, not her individual workplace.  ""If the message is that you can't criticize anything about the health-care system then, among other things, the public is deprived of an independent voice from within the profession,"" he said.   ""If we're seeing, as a blanket principle, that no person who works in health care should be able to say anything publicly in a general way about the quality of care, then I think society is in pretty big trouble.""  Public stain  However, the nurses association believes it's important that Strom be held to account.  In its court submission, the association said Strom should have taken any complaint through official channels and should never have talked about the situation in public.  ""Even though she did not name names, a reasonable person who read the [Facebook] post could easily come to the conclusion that the majority of the small number of nurses who work at this institution are incompetent, lack compassion and don't care about their patients,"" read the submission.  ""It is impossible for a person who works there to distance themselves from this stain.""  The court document also said Strom never brought her concerns up to staff at the health centre, and staff could only remember a handful of times she had ever attended the facility.  ""Do Canadians not care about professional reputations?"" it read. ""Is it not reprehensible to anyone to carelessly use your professional status to harm reputations without getting all the facts or following the proper channels?""  However, Strom's lawyer, Marcus Davies, said the legal challenge has far-reaching applications beyond his client's case, especially for anyone in a profession under professional regulations.  ""There are sort of professional implications here for all of us, whether you're a lawyer, doctor or a chartered accountant,"" he said. ""It's sort of an infringement on our rights by delegation.""   Davies said the Court of Queen's Bench judge erred when he wrote that a professional body's decision should trump the court.  ""We feel that in this case, a panel of nurses does not have the expertise in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms that the court has,"" he said. ""The court should have exercised its discretion to test that.""  The right balance  Keir Vallance, a law professor at the University of Saskatchewan, said courts have generally shown deference when it comes to rulings from professional bodies.  However, he also said the nurses association's decision could be seen as heavy-handed in this instance.  ""The interesting question is whether the regulator found the right balance between their power to regulate their members' speech versus the right of nurses to speak their minds.""  He said there's a good reason associations want to monitor what members say.  ""You don't want, as an example, nurses spreading health disinformation or undermining confidence in the health-care system without some good reason,"" he said.  ""The real question here is, did this particular regulator in this particular instance go too far? Did they go beyond what the public interest requires?""",health
208,"How hi-tech sensors on buildings, cars and in the sky could help keep Toronto's air clean","High tech ""super sniffers"" using next-generation sensing technology and high-powered data crunching could help Toronto track down sources of odour and pollution, according to experts at a conference on air quality this week.  Some of the new systems were on display at the third annual Air &amp; Odour Management Conference and Technology Showcase held at Hart House at the University of Toronto.  Recent U of T grad Omid Youssefi is a research and development engineer at Scentroid, a company that specializes in the manufacturing of odour sensing and analysis equipment. He says right now there are only a handful of monitoring stations sniffing Toronto's air. What's more, the air quality monitoring stations are typically large and expensive.   ""We need enough mobile stations that can be mounted on buildings or poles near schools or other locations of interest to measure the air quality and pollution levels in many locations,"" he said.  Youssefi envisions public-service vehicles, such as police cars, equipped with pollution sensors measuring the quality of the air as they patrol the streets and drones criss-crossing over the city sniffing the atmosphere.  Such a network could provide much-needed real-time data on the toxic cocktail of air pollutants such as carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and ozone. That would help provide a precise forecast about what's in the air we breathe in various areas of the city.    Youseffi says that kind of information could be used by people in their daily commute, which could help them choose different activities or locations during periods of high pollution.  ""Say you are bicycling down the road and you are breathing in lots of air and you want to know what's in the air,"" he said.    The World Health Organization estimates that air pollution contributes to the deaths of seven million people a year, and according health officials in Toronto, fatalities due to poor air quality number in the hundreds annually.   Stephanie Gower of Toronto Public Health says bad air quality can be dangerous to vulnerable populations, and typically children and the elderly bear the brunt of the effects.    ""In the city of Toronto, the latest figures we have is that air pollution contributes to 1,300 premature deaths and 3,500 hospitalizations each year,"" she said.   She says researchers need more sensors in more places providing data from around the city to find the causes.  ""I think of the end of the day, the better the evidence we have the more we have an understanding of what interventions will work the best in terms of improving air quality and improving health,"" she added.  While factories, waste treatment facilities and traffic gridlock are usually blamed for pollution and nuisance odours, Dr. Ardevan Bakhtari, president of Scentroid, says researchers have found new sources.     ""A lot of people associate the cannabis odour with when it's being consumed. But the growing of cannabis and the extraction of oil has a huge odour that is completely different,"" Bakhtari said.  ""It hasn't been really studied for health effects, but for sure it can have a negative impact on your enjoyment of such things as being outdoors.""    Dr. Marianne Hatzopoulou, a Canada Research Chair in Transportation and Air Quality, says it's important to understand what people are inhaling. But the leader of the Transportation and Air Quality research group at the U of T's Department of Civil &amp; Mineral Engineering says it can't be done without more data.  ""We need sensors and instruments that are able to penetrate within what we call urban micro environments into citizens' homes and into very small spaces, so that we can really understand what people are exposed to,"" she said.",technology
104,Canada banning Christian demonstrations? How a private member's bill sprouted fake news,"Imagine scrolling through Facebook when you come across this headline: ""Canada Moves to Ban Christians from Demonstrating in Public Under New Anti-Hate Proposal."" If you think it reads too shocking and absurd to be true, that's because it is.   But this exact headline appeared atop a story that was shared more than 16,000 times online since it was published in May, according to social media tool CrowdTangle. The federal government and Justin Trudeau, who is pictured in the story, are not seeking to ban Christians from demonstrating. In fact, the bill the story is based on was introduced in the Ontario legislature, by a Conservative MPP, and never made it past a second reading.   Incorrect and misleading content is common on social media, but it's not always obvious where it originates. To learn more, CBC News tracked this particular example back through time on social media to uncover where it came from and how it evolved over time.   March 20: Private member's bill introduced in Ontario  In this case, it all started with a bill. In March, Roman Baber, a freshman member of the Ontario provincial legislature introduced his very first private member's bill. Had he known how badly the bill would be misconstrued online, he might have chosen something else, he later told CBC News.   ""I expected that people would understand what prompted the bill, as a proud member of the Jewish community who's been subjected to repeated demonstrations at Queen's Park by certain groups that were clearly promoting hate,"" said Baber, Progressive Conservative member for York Centre.   The bill was simple. It sought to ban any demonstrations on the grounds of Queen's Park, where Ontario's provincial legislature is located, that promote hate speech or incite violence. Baber said the bill was prompted by previous demonstrations that occurred at the legislature grounds.    ""In 2017, we saw a demonstration that called for the shooting of Israelis. We saw a demonstration that called for a bus bombing and murder of innocent civilians,"" he said.   The bill went through two readings at Queen's Park and was punted to the standing committee on justice, where it's languished since.   March 27: Canadian Jewish News covers story  At first, the bill garnered modest attention online. The Canadian Jewish News ran a straight-forward report on the bill that included an interview with Baber shortly after he first introduced it. It was shared only a handful of times.    But a few weeks after the second reading, the bill drew the attention of LifeSiteNews, a socially-conservative website. The story was shared 212 times, according to CrowdTangle, including to the Yellow Vests Canada Facebook group.   In its story, LifeSiteNews suggested that a bill banning hate speech might be interpreted to include demonstrations like those that opposed updates to the province's sex education curriculum.  Baber said this isn't the case, because hate speech is already defined and interpreted by legal precedent.  ""The words 'hate' and 'hate-promoting' have been defined by the courts repeatedly through common law and is enforced in courts routinely,"" Baber said. ""So it would be a mistake to suggest that the bill expands the realm of hate speech.""  April 24: The Post Millennial invokes 'free speech' argument   But the idea stuck around. A few weeks later, on April 24, the Post Millennial posted a story labelled as news that argued the bill could infringe on free speech. The story was, however, clear that the bill was only in Ontario and had not yet moved beyond a second reading. It was shared over 200 times and drew nearly 400 interactions — likes, shares, comments and reactions — on social media, according to CrowdTangle.  May 6: Powerful emotions evoke response on social media   On May 6, a socially conservative women's group called Real Women of Canada published a news release on the bill calling it ""an attack on free speech."" In the release, the group argues that hate speech isn't clearly defined in Canadian law, and draws on unrelated examples to claim that Christian demonstrations, in particular, could be targeted.   For example, the group pointed to the case of British Columbia's Trinity Western University, a Christian post-secondary institution that used to require all students sign a covenant that prohibited sex outside of heterosexual marriage. A legal challenge around the covenant and a potential law school at Trinity Western occurred last year, but it had nothing to do with hate speech.   May 9: LifeSiteNews republishes news release  Though this news release itself was not widely shared, three days later it was republished by LifeSiteNews as an opinion piece. That post did better, drawing 5,500 shares and over 8,000 interactions, according to CrowdTangle It also embellished the release with a dramatic image and sensational headline: ""Ontario Bill Threatens to Criminalize Christian Speech as 'Hate.'""    At this point, the nugget of truth has been nearly entirely obscured by several layers of opinion and misrepresentation. For example, the bill doesn't specifically cite Christian speech, but this headline suggests it does.  These tactics are used to elicit a strong response from readers and encourage them to share, according to Samantha Bradshaw, a researcher on the Computational Propaganda project at Oxford University.  ""People like to consume this kind of content because it's very emotional, and it gets us feeling certain things: anger, frustration, anxiety, fear,"" Bradshaw said. ""These are all very powerful emotions that get people sharing and consuming content.""  May 11: Big League Politics publishes sensational inaccuracies   That framing on LifeSiteNews caught the attention of a major U.S. publication known for spreading conspiracy theories and misinformation: Big League Politics. On May 11, the site published a story that cited the LifeSiteNews story heavily.     The headline and image make it seem like Trudeau's government has introduced legislation that would specifically prohibit Christians from demonstrating anywhere in the country, a far cry from the truth.   While the story provides a few facts, like the fact the bill was introduced in Ontario, much of it is incorrect. For example, in the lead sentence, the writer claimed the bill would ""criminalize public displays by Christians deemed hateful to Muslims, the LGBT community and other victim groups designated by the left.""   The disinformation and alarmist headline proved successful: the Big League Politics version of the story was shared more than 16,000 times, drew more than 26,000 interactions and continued to circulate online for over two weeks.  This evolution is a common occurrence. Disinformation is often based on a nugget of truth that gets buried under layers of emotionally-charged language and opinion. Here, that nugget of truth was a private member's bill introduced in the Ontario legislature. But that fact was gradually churned through an online network of spin until it was unrecognizable in the final product.       At the end of the day, democracy is really hard work. It's up to us to put in that time and effort to fact check our information, to look at other sources, to look at the other side of the argument and to weigh and debate and discuss.  - Samantha Bradshaw, researcher at Oxford University     ""That is definitely something that we see often: taking little truths and stretching them, misreporting them or implementing commentary and treating someone's opinion about what happened as news,"" Bradshaw said. ""The incremental changes that we see in these stories and these narratives is something very typical of normal disinformation campaigns.""    Bradshaw said even though disinformation is only a small portion of the content online, it can have an outsized impact on our attention. With that in mind, she said it's partly up to readers to think critically about what they're reading and sharing online.   ""At the end of the day, democracy is really hard work,"" Bradshaw said. ""It's up to us to put in that time and effort to fact check our information, to look at other sources, to look at the other side of the argument and to weigh and debate and discuss.""

100,Here's what our ancient cousins the Denisovans looked like,"Scientists say they've deciphered features of the skull and some other details of a mysterious extinct cousin of Neanderthals by analyzing its DNA.  The genetic material came from the finger bone of a female member of the Denisovans, a population known mostly from small bone fragments and teeth recovered in Siberia's Denisova Cave.  Denisovans may have occupied that cave from more than 200,000 years ago to around 50,000 years ago. Recently, a Denisovan jaw fragment at least 16,000 years old was reported from in China. But that still gave scientists very little sign of what Denisovans looked like.  Modern-day people did not evolve from Denisovans or Neanderthals, although our species interbred with both and picked up genetic markers that are still detectable in some populations.  The new work used DNA data from two Neanderthals and five ancient and 55 present-day members of our own species, as well as five chimps, in addition to the Denisovan finger bone. Results were reported Thursday in the journal Cell by Liran Carmel of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and others.  They looked for differences in activity levels for specific genes that could affect anatomical traits, which in turn hinted at differences in appearance for those traits. They identified 32 traits that gave clues to the Denisovan skeleton.  As expected, most were shared with Neanderthals, including robust jaws, a low forehead, a large ribcage and a wide pelvis.    The analysis also indicated Denisovans had a wider face than Neanderthals and our own species, and a more protruding face than our own species but less so than Neanderthals, for example. The calculations could not tell how big such differences were.  Such DNA analysis can teach scientists about how our forerunners evolved and how their development differed, Carmel said in an email.  The method showed good accuracy in predicting known physical traits of Neanderthals and chimps, the researchers said. Carmel said the Denisovan jaw fossil matched the method's predictions ""almost perfectly.""  'Brilliant and original'  Experts not connected to the work were impressed.  While it's impossible to know how accurately the study estimated Denisovan traits, its approach is ""brilliant and original,"" said Benedikt Hallgrimsson, of the University of Calgary.  Once the appropriate fossils are found, the study's specific predictions can be tested, said Hallgrimsson, who studies evolutionary aspects of how genes influence physical traits in mammals.    Bence Viola of the University of Toronto, who studies Denisovan fossils, called the work ""a huge step forward.… This would have been called science fiction five years ago.""  The overall picture it gives of the anatomy is ""invaluable,"" although some details are probably incorrect, he said.  Viola said he was skeptical about an artist's renderings that added skin, eyes and hair to the skull produced by the study. Scientists don't know enough about Denisovans to ensure such renderings are accurate, he said.  Carmel, who commissioned the renderings, said they were as anatomically precise as possible but necessarily ""also represent some artistic interpretations.""",technology
113,"You're not trying hard enough on climate change, Greta Thunberg tells U.S. lawmakers","Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg offered a blunt message to Congress on Tuesday as she brought her campaign for urgent action on climate change to the U.S. Capitol.  ""I know you're trying,"" she told Democratic senators at an invitation-only forum, ""but just not hard enough. Sorry.""  Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey thanked the 16-year-old activist for her advice and her activism, which has gained worldwide attention by inspiring a series of protests and school strikes, including one set for Friday.  Thunberg and other young activists bring ""moral clarity"" to the fight against global warming, Markey said.  ""We hear you,"" he told her, vowing that lawmakers ""will redouble our efforts to make sure that we inject this issue into the politics of this building and this country because time is running out.""  Markey and other lawmakers hailed Thunberg as a ""superpower,"" noting that her activism has drawn a passionate following of children essentially challenging their elders to take action.  ""Save your praise,"" Thunberg replied. ""We don't want it,"" she added, especially if officials intend to talk about climate change ""without doing anything about it.""  Thunberg was in Washington ahead of a global strike planned for Friday. Activists are calling for immediate action from the world's governments to halt global warming, reduce fossil fuel consumption and avert environmental catastrophe.    Instead of listening to her and other teenagers, lawmakers should invite scientists to the Capitol to listen to their expertise on ways to slow a rise in global temperatures, Thunberg said.  ""This is not about us. This is not about youth activism,"" she said. ""We don't want to be heard. We want the science to be heard.""  Despite Thunberg's request, lawmakers bombarded her and other youth activists with praise, saying they had sparked a global movement that is already being felt in the 2020 presidential campaign and in the halls of Congress, where lawmakers are debating proposals such as the Green New Deal.  Markey is a co-sponsor of the Green New Deal, which would shift the U.S. economy away from fossil fuels such as oil and coal and replace them with renewable sources such as wind and solar power.  ""We need your leadership,"" he told Thunberg and other activists. ""It's creating a new X-factor"" to boost efforts to fight climate change.    Last month, Thunberg crossed the Atlantic Ocean in a solar-powered boat, landing in New York City on Aug. 28. She's in Washington for several days of rallies and lobbying efforts ahead of Friday's global climate strike.  Thunberg will testify before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday and address the U.N. Climate Action Summit in New York next week.",technology
9,Fed takes action to control short-term interest rates,"The U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of New York carried out $53 billion US in transactions known as repurchase agreements Tuesday as a way to relieve upward pressure on interest rates in overnight money markets.  Economists do not see the action as a signal about where the Fed plans to move its key policy rate, known as the federal funds rate, but rather as a technical exercise to keep the rate in the range set by the central bank.  The Fed is expected to cut this benchmark rate for a second time this year at its meeting this week.  The target for the funds rate, which is the interest rate banks pay each other for overnight loans, currently stands in a range of 2 per cent to 2.25 per cent after a quarter-point cut in July.  On Monday, the funds rate was trading at 2.25 per cent, at the top of its current range. In an effort to move it back into the current range of 2 per cent to 2.25 per cent, the New York Fed announced Monday it planned to conduct a repurchase operation for up to $75 billion on Tuesday morning.    The Fed's operation, which ended up being for $53 billion, was aimed at keeping the Fed's policy rate from trading outside of its range.  Analysts were not certain what had caused higher demands for repurchase agreements to push the trading range higher but said it did not seem to be signalling any fundamental problem with credit markets and could have been tied to an adverse reaction to a jump in oil prices after Saudi Arabia's production facilities were attacked over the weekend.  ""This is a technical exercise and has no implications for Fed policy at all,"" said economist David Jones, the author of four books on the Federal Reserve.",business
97,Hybrid-powered electric cruise ship navigates Northwest Passage ,"A Norwegian company says it has navigated the first hybrid-powered cruise ship through the Northwest Passage using a combination of massive batteries and diesel engines.  The company claims it's the first time a vessel of its kind and size has sailed the route.  Hurtigruten, a cargo, ferry and cruise company from Norway, designed MS Roald Amundsen.  The boat, which is named after Norway's famed polar explorer, completed a more than 3,000-nautical-mile voyage from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean, ending in Nome, Alaska, on Sept. 10. Nearly 500 people were on board.  ""No one even thought it was possible a couple of years ago, including all the biggest cruise lines in the world,"" said John Downey, president of Hurtigruten's American division, about building a hybrid electric-powered cruise ship.   ""This had never ever been implemented before ... we're very proud of her.""    The ship's hybrid technology involves four diesel engines and two large battery packs. Daily emissions from one single cruise ship can be equivalent to one million cars, said the company  The new system, combined with the design of the ship's hull, reduces the ship's emissions by about 20 per cent.  When the ship needs a boost of power, the captain has the option of drawing electricity from the battery packs rather than starting another engine, said Downey.  In some scenarios, like when observing wildlife, the ship can run solely off battery power for about an hour.  The ship also has energy recovery systems, such as using water that cooled engines to help heat the spa and pools. All grey water and waste is stored on board.    ""For this to be happening, it's really delighting to hear,"" said Pam Gross, mayor of Cambridge Bay, Nunavut. Located on the Dease Strait, the hamlet was one of the stops on MS Roald Amundsen's recent voyage.  ""[I] hope it sets a precedent for other ships that are coming through,"" she said.  The community is still weighing the pros and cons of having cruise ships come to town, Gross said.    A cruise ship went aground near Kugaaruk, Nunavut, in 2018. People are worried about emissions, pollution, oil spills and invasive species coming into their waters, said Gross.    ""You know we want to ensure that our waters are being protected and our precious ecosystems underwater.""    Hybrid technology a step in right direction  The Clean Arctic Alliance calls the hybrid technology a good step if it's viewed as a ""transition fuel"" until technology advances to renewable forms of propulsion.  Just under half of the ships in the Arctic still use heavy fuel. The non-profit is campaigning to ban the use of heavy fuel oil from shipping in the Arctic, reducing pollutants including black carbon — an accelerator of climate change — said the alliance.       It's not where we ultimately want to see shipping get to.  It's got to go even further.  - Sian Prior, Clean Arctic Alliance     ""It's a move in the right direction. But it's not where we ultimately want to see shipping get to. It's got to go even further,"" said Sian Prior, the alliance's lead adviser.   She said the industry is at least 10 years away from seeing battery-operated cruise ships.  Hurtigruten along with the Clean Arctic Alliance launched the Arctic Commitment in 2017 to phase out the use of heavy fuel in the Arctic.  ""We think it's completely unnecessary for cruise lines to use [heavy fuel oil]. There's lots of alternative available,"" said Downey.  The company is investing in designing liquid natural gas and biofuel engine supports into retrofitting current ships and future builds.  ""We're continuing to drive toward a point where ... we can eliminate carbon emissions all together. That is our ultimate goal, "" said Downey.",technology
29,Good faith or unfair attack? Saskatchewan appeal court to rule on nurse's Facebook posts ,"The nurse who was found guilty of professional misconduct over a Facebook post will soon learn whether she had the right to make those comments.  Three judges of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal reserved their decision Tuesday on the matter until a later date.  The court heard the Facebook post was made in good faith and was an exercise of her free speech.   Court also heard that the post may constitute fake news, although that wasn't discussed at a lower court hearing, and that there are no charter rights that protect unprofessional conduct.  Post violated social media policy  In 2015, Carolyn Strom wrote a post on Facebook criticizing the health care her grandfather received while in palliative care.   In the post, Strom said staff at St. Joseph's Integrated Health Centre in the town of Macklin, about 225 kilometres west of Saskatoon, needed to do a better job of looking after elderly patients.  ""It is evident that not everyone is 'up to speed' on how to approach end-of-life care ... or how to help maintain an aging senior's dignity (among other things!),"" read part of the Facebook post.  Some of the nurses in the hospital felt Strom's post was a personal attack and complained. The Saskatchewan Registered Nurses Association ruled the post brought the nursing profession into disrepute and violated its social media policy.  Strom was found guilty of professional misconduct and given a $1,000 fine by the association and was ordered to pay $25,000 in tribunal costs.   She appealed the ruling but her appeal was dismissed because the judge could find no reason to interfere with the association's decision, setting the stage for Tuesday's appeal hearing.  'Made in good faith'  On Tuesday, Strom's lawyer Marcus Davies argued her comments never mentioned nurses — just staff.  He said there were roughly 40 staff at the health centre, and it's hard to know specifically who Strom was referring to.   Davies also argued the comments were made in good faith, and that she exercised her right to free speech.  ""In the discipline committee, it says, 'It is accepted that Ms. Strom was not driven by malice,'"" Davies said. ""Well, that means her comments were made in good faith, if she was not driven by malice, then she was driven by good faith.""  The nurses association argued Strom should have gone through the correct channels and lodged an official complaint.   'Fake news'  Roger Lepage represented the Saskatchewan Registered Nurses Association at Tuesday's hearing.  He took the position that there is no charter right protecting unprofessional conduct and that there is no right for individuals to harm the reputation of other individuals.  Lepage argued that Canadians would be harmed if nurses would be able to say whatever they wanted about the health-care system.   He argued Strom's post qualifies ""fake news,"" but the judges presiding stated the previous hearing never found Strom's comments to be untrue, and said Lepage himself shut down that argument then.  Lepage argued Strom's post amounted to venting on social media and that other staff members ""had their hands tied"" by professional ethics.  Lepage also argued that Strom's post was not free speech or part of the public discourse, but rather an attack on an individualized group.  ""If you read her post, it's very personal, she's zeroing in on St. Joseph's, she's zeroing in on Macklin, she's zeroing in on identifiable people who work there, the staff,"" Lepage said.   ""That's what takes this out of the protection that Ms. Strom would ask of this court and was asking of the discipline committee.""  Lepage said that Strom should have filed a formal complaint with the Saskatchewan Health Authority, but didn't.  'I wish it didn't have to be this hard'  Strom spoke with reporters outside court on Tuesday, after the judges decided to reserve their decision.  When asked if she regretted making the posts on Facebook, Strom said she will always stand up for her family and she had no regrets about it.     ""What I don't think is fair is ... what this has turned into,"" Strom said. ""I didn't expect this… I wish it didn't have to be this hard.""  She said she was shocked to hear Lepage comment Canadians would be hurt if nurses were able to say what they want, when they want.   Strom responded to accusations that she was a liar and didn't have her facts right, made by the Saskatchewan Registered Nurses Association's legal representation, and said they were false.  ""I just cannot believe that, that was low, that was false, and I just don't understand how people get away with that,"" Strom said. ""There was absolutely no reason for that to have been said.""  Strom, who is working as a nurse part time in Prince Albert, Sask., said the court case has led her to question whether she wants to be a nurse.   Strom said she couldn't decide today whether she would carry on the case if the judges don't rule in her favour.  ""It will depend; every step is different and it gets harder every time, with respect to the toll that it takes to recover from all of this,"" she said. ""It's just so hard to stay composed when you're so involved.""  3 groups intervene  Three groups have applied for intervener status in the case, including the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association, the Saskatchewan Union of Nurses and the Canadian Constitution Foundation.  The Saskatchewan Union of Nurses (SUN), represented by Ronni Nordal, was the first group to speak on behalf of the interveners.  SUN argued the post was directed specifically at the St. Joseph's Integrated Health Centre, not at the nurses generally.     SUN argued there was no factual basis for which a finding of professional misconduct could be found.  SUN also argued that one of Saskatchewan Registered Nurses Association's statutory mandates is to promote the standing of the registered nurse professionally, not to defend or protect individual nurses, and the organization's argument was not rationally connected to its mandate.  The B.C. Civil Liberties Association, represented by Greg Fingas, argued the informal nature of social media meant that speech should not be compared to a letter from a judge.    The Canadian Constitution Foundation argued citizens should be allowed to express opinions and criticize health care and services without punishment and noted that because public health care dominates public policy, people should be allowed to speak about it.   The federation also asked the court to consider what kind of precedent this decision sets for all professionals who want to share their opinions or concerns.",technology
123,"Handmaid's Tale, Mrs. Maisel guest stars capture early Emmys","A trio of Emmy-honoured actors are winners again for their guest performances in TV series, joined by an awards newcomer.   Bradley Whitford and Cherry Jones received trophies for their The Handmaid's Tale roles at Sunday's creative arts Emmy ceremony.  Jane Lynch and Luke Kirby won on the comedy side, both for The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.  Game of Thrones led with 10 Emmys in technical and other categories at the two-night weekend ceremony, which is the precursor to the main Emmy Awards that will air Sept. 22 on Fox.     The 10 wins included a trophy for Halifax's Paula Fairfield in the sound editing category as part of the team on the HBO drama. It's Fairfield's second win after nabbing a trophy for the same series in 2015. She's been nominated for Game of Thrones in four other years, and received three previous nominations for work on ABCu002FCTV's Lost.    Meanwhile, Montreal-based Elisabeth Williams was among the team of winners for best production design for The Handmaid's Tale, which airs on Crave. She also won last year for the series, and earned a nomination in 2016 for FX's ​​​​​​​Fargo.  The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel was the top comedy series winner, with six awards.  Stage and screen star Jones, who previously won for 24, heaped praise backstage on fellow nominee Phylicia Rashad (This Is Us), calling it ""absurd"" that Rashad has yet to win an Emmy despite four nominations, and saluted Cicely Tyson, nominated for How to Get Away with Murder.  ""I got to tell Ms. Tyson tonight that watching the Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman. is one of the things that made me want to be an actress, and I tell her that every time I see her and she always rolls her eyes,"" Jones said.  Whitford has an Emmy for The West Wing and one for Transparent — the latter for guest actor in a comedy, making him the first actor to win comedy and drama guest star Emmys.    In his acceptance speech, Whitford struck a political note as he thanked Margaret Atwood for the titular novel that is the basis of the dystopian The Handmaid's Tale.  Atwood is ""giving us perspective in this disorienting moment as we are inundated and undermined by a misogynistic, radical, right-wing ideology,"" he said.    ""She understands three things: Despair is not an option. Our children can't afford it. Action is the antidote to despair.""  'They inspire me'  Lynch, who added to her four previous Emmys for series including Glee and Hollywood Game Night, said she based her portrayal of a 1950s comic on the women she grew up watching.  ""I went right to the source: Phyllis Diller, Totie Fields, Moms Mabley,"" Lynch said.  ""Back then, in order for a woman to be in comedy, she had to have a gimmick. Usually that meant cracking wise about her own looks, her bad body, how she can't hold on to a man . but these women did it with such panache and style and such self-possession, and they inspire me.""    Canadian actor Kirby, who played Lenny Bruce on The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, has also appeared in The Deuce and Rectify.    The British marital comedy State of the Union won the Emmy for best short-form comedy or drama series, with short-form acting honours going to its stars, Chris O'Dowd and Rosamund Pike.  Leaving Neverland, which details two men's allegations that pop star Michael Jackson sexually abused them as children, was honoured at Saturday's ceremony as best documentary or nonfiction special.    Before his 2009 death, Jackson denied repeated, similar allegations against him, and his estate has denounced the documentary.    Beyoncé, whose 2018 Coachella festival concert film Homecoming went into Saturday's ceremony with six Emmy nominations, was beaten in all categories.  James Corden's Carpool Karaoke special with former Beatle Paul McCartney returning to his Liverpool hometown won over Homecoming for pre-recorded variety special, while the filmed version of Bruce Springsteen's acclaimed one-man Broadway show triumphed for variety special directing.      Among other awards presented:     Animated program: The Simpsons: ""Mad About the Toy.""   Character voice-over performance: Seth MacFarlane, Family Guy: ""Con Heiress.""   Host for a reality or competition program: RuPaul, RuPaul's Drag Race.   Unstructured reality program: United Shades of America with W. Kamau Bell.   Documentary or nonfiction series: Our Planet.   Commercial: Dream Crazy, Nike.   Music composition for a limited series, movie or special (original dramatic score): Hildur Gudnadottir, Chernobyl: Please Remain Calm.

222,From YouTube to mainstream TV: Lilly Singh and Issa Rae's unconventional paths to success,"In an opening musical rap number for her new show, Lilly Singh poked fun at being a different face of late-night TV.  ""I know you're used to only Jimmys in the spotlight, but I'm gonna throw some melanin up in your late night.""   The 30-year-old YouTube star turned television host is the first bisexual woman of colour to host a late-night show on a major TV network — a point she cleverly joked about in her opening monologue during her show's debut on Monday.  Singh, a native of Scarborough, Ont., is making headlines this week with A Little Late with Lilly Singh, which replaced Last Call With Carson Daly on NBC after 18 seasons.  Sticking true to her internet roots, A Little Late's first-ever episode was streamed on YouTube a few hours before its cable-TV debut — a strategic decision by NBC to tap into the online fan base Singh steadily has built over the last decade through her channel, Superwoman.    Nearly 15 million subscribers follow the YouTube account, where she uploads videos of original skits, interviews and monologues about everything from pop culture to her experience as a child of immigrant Indian parents.  Her brand of comedy resonated with an online audience and helped her land on Forbes' list of highest paid YouTube stars in 2017. It wasn't long before big names, including Dwayne (The Rock) Johnson and Michelle Obama, made appearances on her channel.     ""She essentially has been doing the job on YouTube for like the last 10 years,"" said John Irwin, the executive producer of A Little Late with Lilly Singh, in an interview with CBC News.  That experience self-producing sketches and engaging interviews makes her a natural fit to host a talk show, he added.  Irwin said he first learned of Singh a few years ago, because his daughter used to watch her videos.   ""YouTube and all of these various platforms have opened the door for basically … anybody to be a star. There's just so many ways to now find new talent,"" he said. ""It's going to be interesting to watch how our business continues to morph.""    Singh's talent and charisma sets her apart from traditional comedians who enter late-night and struggle to find their sweet spot, said Irwin, who has worked for Saturday Night Live's Lorne Michaels, as well as produced for Conan O'Brien and Mad TV.   ""There's just that, like, uncomfortableness, where you're watching the host trying to procure an interview, and feel natural and be funny  — and Lilly just, like, had it.""   Singh's first episode Monday featured comedians and stars of The Office, Rainn Wilson and Mindy Kaling. Saturday Night Live funnyman Kenan Thompson, sitcom star Tracee Ellis Ross and comedian Chelsea Handler also made appearances.    While A Little Late boasts a gender-balanced and inclusive writers' room, another distinct feature is Singh's decision to steer away from politics — a topic that dominates late-night TV.  ""[It's] sort of a refreshing sort of stance right out of the gate, because I think you can turn on any one of these shows right now and, for the most part, you're getting the same messaging every single day,"" said Irwin.    Marty Younge, a Toronto-based arts and culture writer, has been watching Singh's career over the years and says her versatility and existing fan base is a huge plus for NBC.  ""She has tremendous crossover potential, because she's already demonstrated, as a YouTuber, the ability to make a lot of content … content that resonates with a large fan base and a younger fan base that is advantageous to them.""     Younge also points to the changing nature of late-night TV, with hosts creating catchy, viral videos that live beyond the early-morning audience and rack up millions of views online. It's likely another reason NBC plans to make sure A Little Late has a strong online presence.  ""Who better to make that digital content other than Lilly Singh?"" she said.    Still, Singh, who is used to working with a small team, will have to adapt to performing in front of a studio audience and working with a large team of writers. ""It will be interesting to see how she transitions into the new medium without alienating her old fans,"" said Younge.  One of the first examples of someone who has successfully made the transition from YouTube to mainstream television is Emmy-nominated actress Issa Rae.  Rae is the star, executive producer and writer of HBO's Insecure, now headed into its fourth season. But Rae got her start on YouTube, where she launched her comedy web-series Awkward Black Girl in 2011.    The show soon caught the attention of comedian and producer Larry Wilmore, who gave Rae her first break and helped her write and create her first TV pilot.  ""I'm here because the internet,"" Rae said in an interview with CBC News, talking about her unconventional path. ""There wasn't a blueprint for getting your show on television.""  Watch Issa Rae talk about paving a new path in Hollywood:    Since the success of Insecure, Rae has starred in a number of film projects, including Little and The Hate U Give. She's also the executive producer behind HBO's A Black Lady Sketch Show, a sketch-comedy late-night series that features a black female director, cast, and writers' room. It was recently renewed for a second season.  Rae says it's inspiring to see how talent born out of the digital space can break barriers in film and television today.  ""I see a lot of leaders, I see a lot of people opening doors,"" she said. ""I see us taking the reins on a lot of our content.""",entertainment
133,Are Quebecers hypocrites when it comes to climate change?,"When they step into the voting booth, will Quebecers put their votes where their mouths are when it comes to climate change?  By many measures, the environment is an issue that matters to Quebecers.  Later this week, tens of thousands are expected to take part in a march through Montreal calling for concrete action on global warming. Polls routinely put the environment at the top of Quebecers' lists of most pressing issues and, according to research at the Université de Montréal, climate change is as important in many rural areas as it is in cities.  Quebecers who took part in CBC's Vote Compass also prioritized the environment as an election issue more than citizens of any other province.    ""The people of Quebec feel a lot more ownership for Quebec than, I think, the rest of Canada feels for their own local environment,"" said Ben Clarkson, English spokesperson for La Planète s'invite au parlement, one of the groups organizing the Sept. 27 climate protest.  ""Quebec sees itself as having a relationship to the land.""  'Like any other North American'  But that isn't quite how they behave, said Prof. Pierre-Olivier Pineau, chair of energy sector management at the business school HEC Montréal.  While Quebec is the province with the lowest per capita emissions, that's largely due to the fact that the province's electricity is produced without fossil fuels — and not because Quebecers are inherently more environmentally friendly, Pineau said.  ""Quebecers behave like any other North American,"" he said.  ""They will eat meat — that has a higher greenhouse gas impact. They travel about more and more by SUV. That also has a big impact. There is no difference in terms of behaviour between Quebecers and other Canadians.""    Pineau co-authored a 2018 study that found Quebec SUV and truck sales have climbed 246 per cent since 1990, while the number of car sales has fallen by 28 per cent.  According to Statistics Canada, Quebecers bought approximately 3,387 light trucks (which includes SUVs and minivans) per 100,000 people in 2018. The Canadian average is 3,796.  The Conference Board of Canada, a non-profit and non-partisan think tank, gave Quebec a ""C"" grade on waste generation and a ""D-"" on energy consumption and intensity.  However, Pineau said there is general agreement among Quebecers that climate change is an issue that needs addressing.  ""Maybe it's hypocrisy, maybe a misunderstanding of what's needed,"" Pineau said. ""But Quebecers do have the aspiration to fight climate change and be good from an environmental perspective.""    He said that even if Quebecers are not, individually, acting to reduce their emissions, the sentiment does ""translate into some political support for big goals.""  Choices, choices   But does that mean environmentally conscious parties will win big in the voting booth?  Not necessarily, said Jean-François Daoust, a post-doctoral fellow at McGill's Centre for the Study of Democratic Citizenship. Daoust, who studies voter behaviour, said it's rare to see a correlation between an issue's importance and voting patterns.  ""For example, 62 per cent of Canadians said that they attribute a lot of attention to the environment in 2015,"" Daoust said. ""But that did not reflect at all at the voting booth as an advantage for the Green Party.""  He pointed out that during the 2018 provincial election, the environment ranked as one of the top issues for Quebecers. Voters still went on to elect a majority Coalition Avenir Québec (CAQ) government, ""which is not necessarily the party that is associated with proactive environmental action,"" he said.  The CAQ scored the lowest among the province's major parties on a report card prepared by environmental groups.     Why the difference? Even for voters passionate about the environment, Daoust said, the issue isn't necessarily top of mind when it comes time to vote.  And Clarkson said focusing on individual actions doesn't help in the fight against climate change.  ""What individual actions can I take to stop the burning of the Amazon?"" he asked.  ""Individuals don't achieve things. Movements achieve things. The banning of child labour was not ended by an individual.""    Clarkson said that, regardless of how many people come out to protest on Sept. 27, he will only consider the event a success if the government meets their demands by creating ""enforceable laws to transform society"" and limiting greenhouse gas emissions.  ""We have a long, long journey ahead of us to create an industrial system where we can live on this planet long term,"" he said.  ""It's not going to be won in a day. But we can get started now.""",politics
92,"1 in 5 people without a family doctor in N.L., says medical association","A lack of family physicians is a growing problem, and the province needs to rethink how it delivers health-care services, says the Newfoundland and Labrador Medical Association.  ""It's a complex situation that's been going on for a long time,"" says Dr. Charlene Fitzgerald, head of the NLMA.  The association commissioned Narrative Research, formerly Corporate Research Associates, to conduct a phone survey, asking people how many of them are currently under the care of a family doctor.  That phone poll was conducted from Aug. 8 to 25, with a random sample of 400 adults. Results are accurate to within 4.9 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.  Of those asked, 81 per cent of people reported that yes, they do have a family doctor, while 19 per cent said they did not. The percentage of people without a doctor amounts to as many as 99,000 residents, the NLMA said.      You can't walk in and have your congestive heart failure, diabetes, emphysema and depression managed in a walk-in clinic.  - Charlene Fitzgerald     For the people who responded they do not have a family doctor, most people reported attending a walk-in clinic service to get their required medical care. Another 42 per cent said they go to the emergency room, while 13 per cent said they go to a general hospital intake for medical services.  ""The first step to finding solutions to a problem is really seeing what the problem is,"" said Fitzgerald, adding that the NLMA has hired a consultant to look into how many family doctors are practising on the ground, how many will be needed in five years, and how many will be needed in 10 years.  ""This is foundational work that needs to be done, and we're going to be releasing it to government once it's done and obviously to the public.""  The NLMA is meeting with Health Minister John Haggie and department officials on Wednesday to discuss the latest poll numbers.  Exodus of family doctors  In the meantime, Fitzgerald said the ""erosion of family medicine in Newfoundland and Labrador is not news,"" adding it's been ongoing in rural parts of the province for years.  ""Rurally, we've seen for many, many years a rotation of family physicians who come and serve for short periods of time and go out, leaving again a new family physician to come back in — if the patients are lucky,"" she said.  ""Now the problem is even inside the overpass, where recent retirements, as well as difficulty in recruiting new-to-practice family physicians, has led to a crisis in family medicine, to the point where patients are adrift.""    Fitzgerald said family practice is a fairly popular discipline at Memorial University's medical school, with more and more students opting into it.  ""However, our numbers show that at the end of their residency training, very few of those actually go into comprehensive community-based family practice,"" she said, adding that many of those who finish their residency here often opt to leave.  Boosting that retention rate, she said, should be the first priority addressed by the province.    ""It's sad to think that they're leaving and working in practices elsewhere, after we've spent a lot of effort and resources in training them, so the recruitment and retention has really got to bump up,"" Fitzgerald told CBC's St. John's Morning Show.  Another rung on the ladder to improving the delivery of health care in the province is reconsidering the current approach.  Walk-in clinics not the answer  Fitzgerald said the family practice of old is a model that doesn't serve the needs of modern patients, and instead, a collaborative, team-based approach is better for everyone.  In addition, she said, consideration should be given to changing the way doctors are paid, and structuring it around the concept of a patient roster, where a physician is caring for and ensuring the good health of a list of regular patients.  That's the kind of care people going to walk-in clinics won't get, she said.  ""Most patients come in on multiple medications, with multiple problems, and they need time and effort and co-ordinated effort. This can't be performed in a fee-for-service system,"" Fitzgerald said.  ""Walk-in clinics are designed to provide one service quickly, and patients nowadays don't need one service quickly, or if they do, many more need comprehensive continuous family medicine care.""  Fitzgerald said more patients now than ever have multiple lifelong conditions that need regular care and attention, and a family physician and team-based approach can be addressed only with consistent care.  ""That kind of problem can't be addressed as a walk-in — you can't walk in and have your congestive heart failure, diabetes, emphysema and depression managed in a walk-in clinic.""

163,"Rising home prices encourage consumers to borrow and spend, giving economy a boost","As Canadian home prices rose from 2014 to 2017, many households tapped the growing value in their homes for other spending, according to study by Bank of Canada economists.  About two million households used home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), but another 380,000 got mortgage financing to raise equity, taking advantage of interest rates that fell in 2015, the researchers say in an analysis released Friday.  That led to an increase of 0.5 per cent in GDP annually because of increased spending, proving the importance of home values to boost consumption and renovation spending, according to researcher Anson Ho.  ""Total equity extraction peaked at $89 billion in 2017. Of this, $49 billion was through HELOCs and $40 billion through mortgage refinancing,"" the study found.  It's generally been a good thing for the economy. Household spending would have been materially lower without equity extraction, the researchers say.  Where the money goes  About 25 per cent of the spending went to home renovations and another quarter went to consumption of other big-ticket items, including cars and furniture. Only about 28 per cent went to debt consolidation, with another 22 per cent going to investments.  The study found household spending tends to rise with home prices. Canadians find it easier to borrow against their homes as values rise.  In 2017, household spending jumped 3.5 per cent, while house prices rose an average of 13 per cent across the country.    Starting in 2015, Albertans were big on tapping HELOCs and refinancing mortgages to tide them over the drop in oil prices.  Conversely, house prices stalled or fell in 2018 and stock markets stumbled. That led to a decline in consumer spending and in borrowing against homes. That could have had a negative impact of 0.1 per cent on the GDP, the researchers found.  ""If this collateral effect is strong, it could leave the economy more vulnerable to adverse events, such as a large decline in house prices,"" the study said.",business
135,Former military ombudsman claims DND vendetta drove him into retirement,"The Department of National Defence conducted a closed-door, wide-ranging review of complaints of mismanagement, nepotism and misuse of public funds in the Office of the Canadian Forces ombudsman last year, CBC News has learned.  The review was instrumental in the early retirement of former watchdog Gary Walbourne, according to recently released Federal Court documents.  In an interview with CBC News, Walbourne said the internal review was a flawed, politically-motivated inquiry intended to isolate and silence him. He also said the process gained significant traction only after a major, private falling out between him and Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan.  Walbourne refused to disclose the substance of his disagreement with the minister in the late winter of 2018, but said it was serious enough that Sajjan refused to speak or even meet with him for the remainder of his tenure.  ""It was a stiff conversation between adults that got a little heated,"" he said. ""Going into detail may breach some of the oaths I've taken as Order in Council appointee.""  Walbourne said that after his clash with Sajjan — which took place in a private meeting on March 1, 2018 in the minister's Parliament Hill office — he quickly found himself out of the loop.  ""Every meeting from that meeting forward was cancelled. There were dozens of them that were set and cancelled over a period of time,"" he said. ""The authorities granted to the ombudsman by the deputy minister's office were altered, changed, truncated, and it just went on and on.""  The conflict, he confirmed, led to him asking for early retirement.  ""For about the last eight or 10 months I was in office, I sat there without financial or human resource authorities signed off by the deputy minister,"" Walbourne said.  ""So when you take away the tools that allow you to do the job, you can't get an audience with the minister to talk about subjects that are of importance ... So there comes a point in time when you have to consider whether I could do any further good.""    Documents, obtained by CBC News through both the Federal Court and independent sources, corroborate Walbourne's statements about the meeting date and the limits placed on his powers.  The apparent falling out with Sajjan was also the culmination of rising friction between the hard-charging, blunt-spoken ombudsman and the defence department, which had grown increasingly irritated with his repeated public criticisms on a number of topics.  The tension in the relationship spilled out into the public in early 2017, when Walbourne complained of ""insidious"" behind-the-scene attacks by DND officials. The relationship was so sour, according to a report at the time by The Canadian Press, that Sajjan wrote to the ombudsman in an attempt to smooth things over.  Walbourne's persistent complaints before parliamentary committees — particularly about the problems of transition to civilian life experienced by military members — were greeted with visible irritation by both military and civilian defence officials.  No answers from Sajjan  Sajjan refused to answer questions about Walbourne's allegations and the revelations in the Federal Court records.  The minister's office released a written statement that did not address the issues and said only that he valued ""the substantive input, mandate and independence"" of the ombudsman's office.  ""I am committed to maintaining a positive and productive working relationship with the Ombudsperson and have encouraged him to come to me should he be facing issues in carrying out his mandate,"" the statement said. ""I will continue to value the work being done by the Office of the Ombudsperson and look forward to continuing to work with the current Ombudsman.""  Gregory Lick was named to replace Walbourne in November of last year.  The review of Walbourne and three other staff members, according to Federal Court records, was carried out by the defence department's assistant deputy minister of review services.  Probe launched after staffer suicide  It was initiated in response to an eight-page written complaint by an investigator on the ombudsman's team after another long-time staffer killed himself in April 2017.  The former ombudsman was accused under the Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act of misuse of public funds, inappropriate hiring practices and promotion without competition, failure to accommodate a mental health disability in relation to the death of his staff member, and failure to create a safe and healthy workplace.  Four of the five complaints against Walbourne were deemed ""founded.""  The allegation of misuse of public funds, involving the hiring of a former journalist to write reports for the office, was thrown out.  Walbourne challenges the remaining findings and denied any wrongdoing.  He said that one of the complaints — of inappropriate hiring — is blatantly false because, while he knew one of the eight applicants for the job in question, he had recused himself from the selection process.  In fact, the staff member, hired in 2014, was vetted by a multi-departmental committee that included an acting assistant deputy minister, a director general from the Public Service Commission and a Department of National Defence human resources executive, according to documents (separate from the court filing) obtained by CBC News.    The defence department was unable to explain how that information was not taken into account in the findings of the investigation against Walbourne.  A former ombudsman's staff member, who left before the complaints were filed, said the watchdog routinely faced pushback from long-time members of the team when he tried to overhaul the office after he took over in 2014.  ""Gary sought to professionalize the investigation teams with mandatory training and the standardization of the way systemic investigations were handled, and how the reports were written,"" said retired lieutenant-colonel Jamie Robertson.   ""This rankled some members of the investigations team — the very same members who were also discontented with the previous ombudsman.""  'No-nonsense, Newfoundlander-direct'  The revamp was a priority following a scathing report by the auditor general, who in 2015 criticized the previous military ombudsman, retired major-general Pierre Daigle, over a host of spending and hiring decisions.  Walbourne's approach ""was always no-nonsense, Newfoundlander-direct,"" and that ruffled feathers, said Robertson.  Other staff members under Walbourne faced similar but separate complaints of misconduct.  Melanie Chapman, Nadine Parker and Robyn Hynes were also faulted by the defence department review.  Chapman, the ombudsman's director of investigations, contested the findings against her. She took her case to Federal Court, saying the independent investigators and senior defence officials who sat in judgment never told her the substance of the complaints and denied her the opportunity to properly defend herself.  A Federal Court judge ruled her treatment by defence officials was unreasonable.  ""She was not given procedural fairness in the investigation process,"" Judge Russel Zinn wrote in a July 23 ruling.  ""She was not clearly apprised on the alleged wrongdoing, and she was not informed what evidence had been gathered by the investigator. In short, she was not given a meaningful right to be heard or given the opportunity to know the case against her at any stage of this process.""  The judge ordered the department to re-examine her case.  'Collateral damage'  Walbourne said he believes the complaints against him and the rest of the staff were handled in the same arbitrary manner.  The investigation, which was conducted by an outside agency before being handed to the head of the defence department's review services, was formally launched in the fall of 2017.  Walbourne said he believes officials seized upon the complaints and made them part of a systematic campaign to discredit his office within the federal government after a series of hard-hitting reports on the transition issues facing members of the military.    ""I do believe the object of the investigation was me, but this investigation was not just about me,"" he told CBC News. ""There were other members of my staff who I consider to be collateral damage.""  The former ombudsman made his concerns about the investigation known to Sajjan when he decided to retire ahead of schedule.  ""The process has been flawed from the beginning and activity throughout has been suspicious,"" he wrote in his March 2, 2018 resignation letter, which was obtained by CBC News. ""The names of those accused have been released and are being shared across the environment. A direct attempt to discredit and defame.""  Court records filed in connection with the Chapman case make reference to a whisper campaign and show a senior staffer in deputy minister Jody Thomas' office acknowledged discussing the investigation of the ombudsman and his staff with at least nine senior defence bureaucrats.    The revelation, according to the court papers, cost Chapman a shot at the leadership of the military's newly created sexual assault response centre.  The court documents also spell out how the defence department altered and limited the financial and human resources powers of the ombudsman while Walbourne was still in charge.  Robertson said that, throughout his time serving two ombudsmen, he saw both examples of extraordinary cooperation and closed-door bureaucratic rebukes.  It is time for change, he said.  ""To be an effective ombudsman you are unlikely to win a popularity contest with the organization you are overseeing,"" said Robertson.  ""Each and every (CAF) ombudsman since 1998 has strongly recommended that the office should report directly to Parliament and should be administratively de-coupled from DND as this gives the department de facto control over financing, [human resources] and other elements that can impact the day to day functioning of the office.""",politics
170,Thomas Cook travel on verge of collapse,"Thomas Cook, one of the world's oldest and largest travel companies, is facing a race against time to stay afloat and ensure that around 150,000 British travellers can get home.  The debt-laden tour operator confirmed Friday it was seeking £200 million ($330 million Cdn) in extra funding to avoid its collapse. If Thomas Cook goes under, Britain's Civil Aviation Authority would likely be ordered to launch a major repatriation operation to fly stranded vacationers home.  The company says it is in talks with stakeholders such as leading Chinese shareholder Fosun to bridge a funding gap. The money required would be a ""seasonal stand-by facility"" and come on top of the £900 million ($1.4 billion) of new capital already raised, Thomas Cook said in a statement Friday.  ""The recapitalization is expected to result in existing shareholders' interests being significantly diluted, with significant risk of no recovery,"" it said.  In May, Thomas Cook reported in half-year results that it had a net debt burden of $2 billion. It said political uncertainty related to Britain's departure from the European Union had led to softer demand for summer holidays. The company said higher fuel and hotel costs also were weighing on business.  A spokesman for Royal Bank of Scotland, one of Thomas Cook's lenders, said the bank ""has provided considerable support"" to the tour operator over many years and ""continues to work with all parties in order to try and find a resolution to the funding and liquidity shortfall.""  Any failure to raise the required capital would elicit questions about the jobs of the 22,000 staff Thomas Cook employs around the world. It sold the Canadian branch of its travel service to Air Transat in 2006.  ""It is appalling that banks that owe their very existence to handouts from the British taxpayer show no allegiance to a great British company, Thomas Cook, when it needs help,"" said Brian Strutton, general secretary of the British Airline Pilots Association.  ""If Thomas Cook goes into administration it will cost the taxpayer as much to repatriate holidaymakers as it would cost to save Thomas Cook,"" Strutton added.

The shop was there when player pianos and gramophones were the only way to play recorded music in your home. It was there as vinyl rose to prominence, fell out of favour, and then rose once again.    It has been a fixture in the community for almost a century — but now, what is undoubtedly one of the oldest music shops in the country is closing its doors in December.  The music business just isn't what it once was, and so co-owners Bill and David Wilson feel the time is right to hang it up.  ""I've had a few people trying to talk me into another three years to make it 100, but I'm ready to go,"" Bill Wilson told CBC News at the shop on 87 Simcoe St. N.  ""We're just feeling a difference now. And that's why we're going.""  History stretching back to 1922  The two brothers are the last of three generations of family who have been running the business.  It was started by their grandfather, William George Wilson, way back in 1922. He was a piano tuner who trained at the Canadian National Institute for the Blind and started out fixing up old pianos in a room in his home.  Two years later, he moved into his first shop on Simcoe Street and started bringing in player pianos and piano rolls. Gramophones and record players came next.    William Wilson died in 1941, but Bill and David's father, William Sr., kept things going. The business really flourished when he returned from the service after the Second World War.  The current shop was built in 1953. It's a throwback to the golden age of music stores, full of tapes, CDs, records, sheet music and instruments.    The brothers still show up to work each day neatly dressed in suits. There's no computerized inventory on site — instead, they rely on a borderline encyclopedic knowledge of music and their products.  Standing in the store's vinyl section is where Bill always felt the most at home, surrounded by scores of 45s, 78s and LPs.    ""That's my love. I know this stuff pretty well inside out,"" he said. ""I'm getting a little bit loosey goosey on the new guys, but, you know, I'm not dealing with those people anyone. The kids are streaming and downloading, not buying CDs.""  David, who handles the bulk of the store's instrument sales, has seen similar trends.  ""You can just see it. We're ready to go,"" he said.  'Part of my life'  The shop has meant a lot to people over the years. Sharon Hudson visited on Saturday because she heard it was shutting down.  ""I've been coming here since I learned piano at a very young age. This is where I got all my sheet music when I was learning to play,"" she said.  Now, she brings in her son to pick up his guitar strings, and her daughter for drum sticks. The knowledge the Wilson brothers have at their disposal was just invaluable, she said.  ""They just seem to know everything about everything.""    Though the end is creeping up, it's still tough for David and Bill to fully reflect on just what the store has meant to them all these years.  ""Since the time I've been 14, this has been part of my life,"" David said. ""I've never not done this. I don't know what it's going to be like until I've stopped.  ""[So] ask me that another year from now.""  adam.carter@cbc.ca",entertainment
229,"Céline Dion talks Courage, life after René Angélil and her new outlook","Céline Dion has been reinventing herself ever since she got her first taste of stardom in Quebec at age 12.  At 22 years old, the Charlemagne, Que.-born artist released her first English-language album, Unison, and not long after that she burst into the English-speaking world with a cascade of massive hits, including Beauty and the Beast, The Power of Love and My Heart Will Go On.    In 1994, Dion married her longtime manager, René Angélil, in a lavish ceremony that was one of the biggest celebrity events in Canada's history. Less than a decade later, in 2003, she headed to Las Vegas where her theatrical, explosive concert residency transformed the city.   Today, Dion is evolving again. She's been emerging from the passing of her husband in 2016, she wrapped up her 16-year residency in Las Vegas this summer, and the word that seems to define her the most right now is ""courage."" Beyond describing her current outlook on life, Courage is also the name of her new album and world tour that just kicked off this week in Quebec City.     The Canadian music icon sat down with q host Tom Power in Montreal to tell us more about this new chapter in her life.  Here is part of that conversation.  On her final residence show in Las Vegas  If I recall correctly, people thought that it was going to be very emotional for me, and that it was going to be really hard for me, but I knew what I was getting myself into probably the next day or a couple of days after that. Of course, don't get me wrong, I stayed so long in Vegas ⁠— actually, I still live in Vegas and I raised my kids in Vegas ⁠— it will always be a home for me because this is where I still live. Even though I am in Montreal right now where my roots are and this is really home.  To make a long story short, I felt very strong. When I did the live show, even though there were a lot of butterflies, I did not want to cry. I love what I do and when I get embraced by the audience, I get taken by the emotions. So I said to myself, I want to have a good time, especially tonight, because it's my last show, so let's make it like a party. I have to say, I don't remember if I cried, I don't think I did. If I did not cry, I'm very proud of myself. Everything that I've done for so long there with my team, we have accomplished so much and I'm proud of that.  On what the word ""courage"" means to her  Well, it means that everybody is going through things in life. I would say when something bad happens to you in life, you have to find a way to overcome these obstacles and find a way to find inner strength. To say, that's part of life, this is not something that you choose. This is something that is imposed on you by life. It's up to you to go through these obstacles, and you have the options, if you're going to need help or not, or how you're going to go through this. We all do have good moments and bad moments. And we all lose people.    On the loss of her late husband and longtime manager, René Angélil  Losing the father of my children, my husband, my manager, the person that I love the most in the world and the person that I can rely upon without questioning anything since I was 12 years old — losing that person was a big deal for me. It reflected on a lot of people that I've been surrounded by for 20 years. We are still missing him tremendously, believe it or not.  It takes courage because I'm a single mom and I don't want my kids, my entourage and the people that I love to feel that because I have lost the man of my life that I'm going to lose the essence of what I love, my passion.  I really believe that through all the years with René, who gave me so much, who taught me so much, who gave me so much luggage, that when he left for his new chapter, his new life, he gave me the rest of his luggage. I feel him through the eyes of my kids and inside of me. I felt very, very, very strong, probably stronger than ever before.  On the evolution of her career and younger generations discovering her music for the first time  Well, I don't know. Don't make me blush. I'm happy. I see it. Don't get me wrong, you cannot please everybody, but I don't care. I've done everything that's needed to be done to have an international career because this is what I wanted. I don't need to prove to my family, my friends, the industry or myself anymore. I did that. They gave me a spot and I took it. I never wanted to have a hit, I wanted to have a career.    On working with producer David Foster on All By Myself  David and I had taken a whole day with the piano on a speakerphone to choose the key. I arrived in L.A. and he says, ""You're gonna freak out. I'm so happy about my production. I'm going to play you the track. Let's do this. It's going to be amazing. It's going to be big."" I mean, with David, everything's going to be big, you know? So it was amazing, but then I said, ""David, is that the final key?"" I think it was like a key and a half higher, and I'm like, okay, why did we spend a whole day on the key that works and now I'm over here? I think everything exploded, my pants, my bra, my shirt. When I hit that note, what you hear in the back is not the drums, it's my clothes that exploded. People stop breathing when I hit that note.    On how it feels to be back home in Quebec  It's amazing. To see my kids enjoy where I grew up, where they don't come enough, and to see their uncles and my mom, and to play outside in their bare feet and they don't burn their feet. Vegas has given us a lot over all these years, but when you go outside in bare feet in Vegas, you might come back with melted toenails. So here it's like the weather, and the nature, and to pick tomatoes from our little gardens. For the kids to just play badminton, and ball, and bicycle, it's like I said, these are the moments that they will never forget. This is a heritage that I give them and I'm so lucky that I was born here. This is the blood that's going through my veins mixed with some maple syrup. So that's why I'm a sweet girl.  Dion just launched a world tour called Courage. Her latest album, also called Courage, will be released later this year. Below are three songs from the new album.

72,More Fed cuts expected to push Canadian interest rates lower: Don Pittis,"A weakening global economy and continued trade fears — and emphatically, he said, not angry words from U.S. President Donald Trump — convinced U.S. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates on Wednesday for the second time this summer.  And for Canadians waiting for lower rates, those same global forces are on their way, and will likely force Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz to follow suit.  Despite the fact that the quarter point cut was widely expected, the move had an immediate effect on the Canadian dollar which fell promptly after Powell's announcement.   While Powell said shrinking industrial activity justified the cut, he insisted that he and his advisers expect the economy to continue to grow, and predicted there would likely be no more interest rate cuts this year.  Markets — which have been predicting a series of cuts and, until recently, expected a larger half point cut — tumbled on the news.  After repeated attacks on Powell and the central bank, whom Trump recently described as ""boneheads,"" it was hardly surprising that the president expressed his unhappiness with the Fed chair's mild rate cut.    ""Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve Fail Again. No 'guts,' no sense, no vision!"" tweeted the U.S. president.  Powell insisted that such insults were not going change the bank's outlook, and that despite the repeated attacks morale within the organization remains strong.  ""I assure you that my colleagues and I will continue to conduct monetary policy without regard to political considerations,"" said Powell.  He said the bank's decision not to make the kind of deep cuts Trump has been demanding is because much of the economy remains robust.  ""The consumer is spending at a healthy clip,"" said Powell. ""The labour market is still strong.""  'Good solid year'  Powell sees growth for 2019 and 2020 coming in at two per cent, which he described as ""a good solid year,"" and the purpose of the two rate cuts this summer, he said, have been to keep the economic expansion alive.   ""If you look at things that are happening in the economy, I personally see a high value in sustaining the expansion because we really are reaching, this positive economy is reaching, communities that haven't been reached in a long time,"" said Powell.  If that stimulus acts as intended, the economic boost is likely to work its way across the border into Canada, perhaps delaying the need for rate cuts here.  ""Global capital markets are highly integrated and our long rates are definitely pulled down by the very, very low rates that are abroad,"" said Powell. Those low overseas rates are one of the reasons for the inverted yield curve — a potential recessionary indicator from the bond market — and are a sign that parts of the global economy are on the rocks, he said.     The Bank of Canada always insists it is not directly affected by U.S. interest policy moves, says Scott Aquanno, a political economist at Ontario Tech University, in Oshawa, Ont., who studies central banking.  But just as Powell fears possible contagion from the struggling economies of China and Europe, Canada will also feel the effects of U.S. moves.  ""The domestic conditions that the Bank of Canada references when they say they are going to act on their own terms are set, in many respects, by what the Federal Reserve does,"" said Aquanno. And that means lower rates are coming to Canada too, he said.  ""It won't act immediately because these kinds of things take a little while to trickle through the economy and to play out, but this does indicate … that the long-term trajectory for the Bank of Canada is a rate cut not a rate increase.""    Market disruption  At Wednesday's news conference Powell was asked about this week's credit crunch in short-term money, in what is called the repo market, when a shortage of lenders in the market for overnight money pushed rates far above the central bank's interest rate range, indicating the Fed had been caught short.   Because something similar happened before the 2007-08 credit crunch that led to the Great Recession, online chatter worried this week's market jolt was a symptom of something worse. That was a view Powell was anxious to dispel.   ""We don't see this as having any implication for the broader economy or for the economic outlook,"" Powell told reporters.  But when the central bank began its emergency lending this week, banks came cap in hand for $53 billion US on Tuesday and another $80 billion on Wednesday.    ""That's $130-plus billion the banks have asked the Federal Reserve for, so that's not insignificant, and in many respects it's starting to feel like a mini, kind-of crisis within short-term funding markets,"" said Aquanno.  The Fed is expected to release another $75 billion today in an attempt to steady the market, and Aquanno says it is crucial that they do for not just the U.S. but the Canadian and the global market.  ""Once the Fed loses the capacity, or is perceived to have lost capacity to manage short-term rates, then that introduces tremendous volatility into the system because the Fed remains the global central bank, even more so that it did 15 years ago.""

214,Why a 'just transition' doesn't have to pit jobs against the environment,"This story is part of a CBC News series entitled In Our Backyard, which looks at the effects climate change is having in Canada, from extreme weather events to how it's reshaping our economy.    One of the recurring themes among some politicians and business leaders is that climate change presents a binary choice between preserving jobs or the environment.  But that's not the way Dwaine MacDonald sees it. MacDonald is one of the co-founders of Trinity Energy Group, a company based in Stellarton, N.S., that makes commercial and residential buildings more energy-efficient, through better insulation and thermal barriers. And business is very good.  To give a sense of Trinity's expertise, in 2010, the company worked on a 14-bedroom farmhouse that every year required 14 cords of wood and two barrels of oil for their heating needs. Trinity's retrofit brought it down to four cords of wood and half a barrel of oil.    This example shows why the International Energy Agency has identified energy efficiency as one of the most effective ways of reducing carbon emissions. It also shows why a concerted transition to a low-carbon economy can be beneficial to both the environment and blue-collar and unionized workers, including those in the fossil fuel industry.  Since MacDonald and his partners launched the company in 2006, Trinity has grown to 80 full-time employees — and he estimates that about a quarter of them are people who were let go from, or simply left, jobs in the Alberta oilsands.  ""I could be hiring more people if I could keep up with the demand,"" said MacDonald. ""It's slowing us down right now, just trying to find the right people.""  As a sign of labour's stake in the environmental challenge, Unifor, the largest private-sector union in Canada, voted to join the global climate strikes scheduled to take place across the country and around the world, on Sept. 20 and Sept. 27.  Major unions in France, Germany and Italy have also announced their intent to join the climate strikers.  Changing tone  The working class is increasingly on-side with climate action, said Jamie Kirkpatrick, program manager at Blue Green Canada, an organization that advocates for workers and the environment, and is aligned with Unifor and the United Steelworkers.  But Kirkpatrick acknowledges there is ""fear and concern"" among some workers about what a transition to a low-carbon economy means for them. Part of that has to do with the sometimes abrasive tone of climate activists.    ""I think a lot of environmental efforts were focused on 'shut this thing down,' 'phase this out,' 'get rid of that dirty, nasty industry,'"" said Kirkpatrick. ""And I think we've learned a lot about how everybody involved is a human being, and we could talk about [a transition] in a more human way.""  You can see that more measured tone in the messaging of the federal Green Party, for example. The party's platform includes halting federal subsidies to the oil sector and cancelling the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project as part of a larger effort to drastically reduce Canada's greenhouse gas emissions.  But Green Party Leader Elizabeth May has stressed ""we are not at war with fossil fuel workers. We are not at all willing to leave any part of Canada or any community behind.""  Kirkpatrick said his organization strives to ""make the connections, and make it true that you can have a good job and a healthy environment.""    'We're missing half the picture'  Kirkpatrick said it has been hard for a lot of workers to visualize the employment possibilities in what's become known as a ""just transition."" Some of that has been down to a lack of data about the size of the green sector.  Earlier this year, Clean Energy Canada, a think-tank at Simon Fraser University, put out a report that quantified the number of clean-energy jobs by combing through the latest available data from a variety of sources, including Statistics Canada.    Clean Energy Canada found that in 2017, there were almost 300,000 jobs in the clean-energy sector — more than the approximately 200,000 positions in the petroleum sector.  ""When we talk about energy, we really all think about oil and gas,"" said Merran Smith, executive director at Clean Energy Canada. ""But we're missing half the picture.""    Clean Energy Canada's research also seeks to expand the understanding of what ""green jobs"" even means. Smith points out it can include everything from energy efficiency to installing solar panels to companies building electric buses, such as New Flyer in Winnipeg and the Lion Electric Company in Quebec.  Personal challenges  Unifor and the United Steelworkers have both passed resolutions on the need for Canada to meet the emissions reductions targets in the Paris Agreement. But acknowledging the need to preserve the environment doesn't mean there aren't significant personal challenges.  Roy Milne, who has worked at the Highvale Coal Mine near Wabamun, Alta., since 1983, has seen how rocky this transition can be. Operated by TransAlta, Highvale has supplied coal to the Sundance and Keephills power stations for decades. As part of government efforts to draw down coal power, the plants are moving to cleaner-burning natural gas within the next few years.    Milne, who is president of United Steelworkers Local 1595, understands the need to reduce carbon emissions and attended last year's international climate conference in Katowice, Poland, to learn about how other countries were managing the transition.  He said TransAlta ""got a big chunk of change"" from the provincial government in compensation for an early shutdown of the Keephills 3 plant and the cancellation of power-purchase agreements. This, combined with the federal government's extension of operating licences for switching from coal to natural gas, is resulting in hundreds of layoffs.    Milne, who is 60, said he's less concerned about his own future than that of younger union members considering their options in the cleantech sector. He said that an electrician working at Highvale currently makes between $120,000 and $150,000 a year. If that person were to switch to installing solar panels, after taking a government-sponsored course, they could expect to make about $40,000-$60,000.  ""It's pretty hard to get workers enthused about a transition to a green economy when it means the reality, at least for us out here, is cut my wages in at least half and take away all my benefits and pension and make it precarious employment,"" Milne said.  Ensuring a just transition  Given that government is setting these environmental goals, Milne said government should also provide a blueprint and the necessary training to ensure a transition is indeed ""just.""  Dwaine MacDonald can certainly attest to this. Trinity Energy Group benefited from Efficiency Nova Scotia (formerly Conserve Nova Scotia), a program that aligned utilities with local contractors in a concerted bid to improve energy efficiency provincewide.  ""That support from the province was instrumental,"" said MacDonald, who points out that Efficiency Nova Scotia's operating model has garnered interest from other provinces, U.S. states and even Bermuda.  ""It's doing good for the environment and it's doing good for the residents of the province,"" said MacDonald. ""It's mind-boggling the spinoffs we see.""",technology
51,Trudeau faces friendly crowd at Saskatoon town hall after a day of damage control over blackface photos,"A day after Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau's campaign was knocked off balance by several photos and a video that showed him in blackface, he faced questions from a relatively friendly Liberal crowd at a town hall event in Saskatoon, Sask. on Thursday evening.  The event, originally billed by the Liberal campaign as a rally, attracted around 500 people, and saw Trudeau questioned about his plans for combating climate change, advancing reconciliation and helping small businesses.  He also faced, for the first time directly from Canadians, questions on the blackface photos that have upended his campaign.  Minutes after Trudeau delivered his opening remarks, Trudeau was asked whether, if he couldn't recollect the precise number of times he's worn blackface makeup, he could ""round to the nearest five.""  ""It's not something we should make light of,"" said Trudeau, who declined to offer a number.    ""What I did was inexcusable and wrong and hurt a lot of people who considered me to be an ally and that was wrong. And I am deeply, deeply sorry.""  In the next comment from the crowd, a man in a yellow vest — who was wearing it not as a statement but because it is part of his safety gear for his job as a fuel distributor — told Trudeau he didn't think he should apologize.    ""Please do not apologize. When you were young, you were in school,"" he said.  ""I appreciate that and I appreciate the sentiment — but there was no excusing what I did and I'm sorry that I did it,"" Trudeau said.  ""And the same time yes, we do need to focus on how we move forward as a country on many big issues … one of those issues is making sure we have leaders that don't hurt people who face discrimination in their daily lives.""    Trudeau was also asked about his plans to de-escalate the tensions between India and Pakistan, fight fires in the Amazon rainforest and invest in science and technology.  One woman, who said she was a single mother and award-winning photographer ""drowning"" in debt, asked whether Trudeau would hire her as his personal photographer or accept ""a free photo session as payment for my accumulated government debt.""    Trudeau answered by touting his government's Canada Child Benefit and promising that a newly elected Liberal government would increase that benefit by 10 per cent per child in the first year after they're born, and suggesting a Conservative government led by Andrew Scheer would mean cuts to services and to the middle class.  Asked about climate, Trudeau spoke about his party's carbon tax, an issue of contention in Saskatchewan, saying ""Scheer's 'make pollution free again' is a real problem.""  ""During the (Stephen) Harper years, their desire to focus only on the economy and not on the environment actually didn't help the economy at all,"" he said.    While the Liberal campaign was temporarily on hold Thursday morning as Trudeau spoke to MPs and others by phone and his team worked to control the damage caused by the blackface photos, the itinerary for Friday shows an announcement and media availability planned for 10:30 a.m. ET in Toronto.",politics
47,NDP candidate urges Elections Canada to ensure smooth vote in remote First Nations ,"The federal NDP candidate running in the Ontario riding of Kenora has written Elections Canada urging it to ensure voters in remote First Nations in the riding don't face the same obstacles to casting ballots that surfaced in the 2015 election.   Grassy Narrows First Nations Chief Rudy Turtle sent a letter to Canada's chief electoral officer Stéphane Perrault on Thursday asking how the electoral agency plans to avoid issues like shortages of ballots and the delayed opening of voting stations in the upcoming vote.   ""First Nations living in the electoral district of Kenora have faced serious barriers to exercising their democratic rights in the past, especially during the 2015 election, as a result of administrative failures,"" said the letter, provided to CBC News.   ""I look forward to hearing how Elections Canada plans on addressing these issues in the current election.""  Turtle could not be reached for comment.     The NDP said in a statement that the party raised voting issues in the region with Elections Canada during the last election.   ""[The] letter is both a call to ensure that Elections Canada does what it takes and an opportunity for them to share with us the work they may have already done to ensure that every First Nations person in the riding gets the chance to make their voice heard,"" said the statement.  Turtle raised concerns over the shortage of ballots in the First Nations of Eabametoong, Onigaming, Whitefish Bay and Shoal Lake 40 in the riding in the last election.   ""In two communities this shortfall was addressed by photocopying ballots, however these kinds of situations undermine confidence in the electoral process and can result in excessive wait times,"" wrote Turtle.   ""In some instances where such additional ballots were produced, voters faced long lines and confusion, ultimately resulting in disenfranchised voters leaving the polling station before being provided the opportunity to cast a ballot.""  Polling station closed after running out of ballots  During the 2015 election, 14 on-reserve polling places in nine electoral districts ran low on ballots, according to Elections Canada.  In most cases, voting was interrupted from a few minutes to about a half hour, with one station in Lake St. Martin, Man., shutting down before the polls closed because it ran out of ballots, preventing about 13 voters from casting a ballot, according to Elections Canada.    Turtle's letters raised concerns about the situation in Northwest Angle 37, where parts of the community had no polling station, and in Windigo Island where voters would have to travel over an hour by boat to vote.   One of the issues that also surfaced was over information given to First Nations voters, said the letter. A voter in Big Trout Lake received a voter information card telling him to vote in the community of Wawakapewin, despite there being a polling station in his own community, wrote Turtle.   The letter said there were also concerns about the delay in opening polling stations in the last election in places like Eabametoong and Turtle suggested Elections Canada should provide advance polling in larger rural and remote First Nations and provide mail-in ballots to smaller communities.  Elections Canada says it's working to remove barriers  Elections Canada said in a statement that it had received Turtle's letter and that the agency conducted a ""thorough administrative review"" following the last election and made several changes.   The statement said the agency has improved its ballot forecasting formula to increase the ""cushion for extra ballots in remote areas,"" along with upping its registration rates on reserve and maintaining continual outreach to First Nations.   ""We are aware that Indigenous electors face more barriers to registering and voting in federal elections,"" said the statement.  Elections Canada has also sent a team to Kenora-area First Nations three times since February 2018, running workshops and hosting activities on the electoral process and to improve ways of sharing election information.     The agency is now shipping information packages in English and Ojibway to the Treaty 3 organization to distribute to communities at the upcoming fall assembly in early October.  Five Kenora riding-area First Nations are also among 87 Indigenous communities, across 27 electoral districts, that are part of a recently-created pilot project to deal with specific demands and barriers to voting.   Kenora is one of the ridings identified by the Assembly of First Nations where the Indigenous population could tip the electoral outcome. The riding has an Indigenous population of about 25,162 eligible voters.  The 2015 election saw a spike in on-reserve voter turnout, which hit 61.5 per cent. The on-reserve turnout in 2011 was about 47 per cent, according to Elections Canada data.",politics
140,"Parties are promising to spend spend spend, but details scarce on how they'll pay for it","Vassy Kapelos, host of CBC News Network's Power and Politics  I ran into former Conservative staffers the other day who had worked for Brian Mulroney, some of whom had also worked for Stephen Harper.  No shocker — they're not fans of Justin Trudeau.  But they also don't understand Andrew Scheer and the current Conservative campaign.  ""It's a spend-a-palooza,"" one former staffer remarked to me. ""I just don't get it — they're out of control!""  He was referring to announcements the Conservatives have made over the first 10 days of the campaign: tax credits if you have a kid enrolled in a fitness or arts program, a tax credit if you use public transit, a universal income tax cut, money for medical equipment, expanding RESP grants and making parental benefits tax free.  According to The Canadian Press, the grand total for those promises? About $9 billion — a mix of spending and federal treasury money foregone. Offsetting that, the party so far has said it will review corporate subsidies and come up $1.5 billion of savings.   Don't worry — they're not alone. Every party is willing to spend your money like I spend at Sephora on a Saturday morning.   The Liberals will boost the Canada Child Benefit, also make parental leave benefits tax free and expand them, increase old age security, give money for startup businesses and spend about a half a billion dollars a year to create up to 250,000 more before- and after-school child care spaces.  The NDP and Greens' promises aren't cheap either. Take pharmacare for the NDP, coming in at $10 billion (they say they'd do it within the first year elected), and the Greens promise a guaranteed basic income, which outside estimates have pegged at more than $70 billion.    Don't mistake the math for judgment. These are all worthy proposals for Canadians to consider and they could make a material difference to our lives (I should also point out the Conservatives and NDP provide independent costing of their proposals in real time, while the Liberals and Greens will only do so with their full platforms — date TBD).  But largely absent in the conversation up to this point is that fulfilling those promises will involve trade-offs.

""There's an opportunity cost when we're giving something up; whether it's our money or whether the government is going to give up money… we really need to be careful, and to think about how all of these things fit together and what that means for the government's bottom line.""  The spend-a-palooza could mean one of three things. Either the deficit gets bigger (because revenue is down or spending is up), spending gets cut or the government finds new ways to raise revenues (because no party will dare say they're raising taxes on the average voter).    I was terrible at math (there's a reason I'm a journalist), but even to me that's obvious.  So what will the parties do? Will the deficit increase or will spending slow down? The either-or has informed the political discussion for the last four years and especially since Ontario Premier Doug Ford's budget in April.   You remember it: spending slowed or was cut in a bunch of areas — and then there was a backlash and many of those decisions were reversed. Within a few months, prior to a lot of it being reversed, Ford's popularity plummeted and the federal Liberals started using his name as much as I eat carbs — which is a lot.   The debate, if you can call it that, then became: the Liberals will spend all your money and your kids will pay for it, or the Conservatives will cut everything so your kids won't even have pens at school.  I'm doubtful either is true, but the politics of the months following the Ontario budget have obviously affected the way this campaign is being communicated. Yes, Andrew Scheer talks about balancing the budget, but there's no real focus on it. At each of his stump stops, there's not much about how it would happen (yet) or where spending could slow.   Again — that's not unique to the Conservatives. The Greens also promise to get back to balanced books, but we're still waiting for the details. And how much are the Liberals or NDP willing to add to the deficit? Is there a limit to how much they're willing to pile on? I have no clue because ain't nobody talkin' 'bout it.   Politicians have apparently made the determination it wouldn't be popular to do so.    Power Lines  The Power &amp; Politics Power Panelists on where the big parties will be focused this week  Amanda Alvaro  president and co-founder of Pomp &amp; Circumstance The Liberals will be seeking as many opportunities as possible for Canadians to connect with the leader in order to air their concerns and hear from him directly. Expect the Liberals to continue to contrast their approach of progress and investment for the middle class against some of the expected Conservative cuts to services families rely on.   Rachel Curran senior associate at Harper &amp; Associates Consulting Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer will continue to reveal elements of his plan next week to put more money back in the pockets of Canadian taxpayers., including introducing a Universal Tax Cut for all taxpayers worth up to $850 per year and reintroducing the Children's Fitness and Arts Tax Credits. At the same time, he will argue that Liberal leader Justin Trudeau has lost the moral authority to govern, on the heels of the bombshell ""blackface"" revelations this week.  Kathleen Monk principal at Earnscliffe Strategy Group New Democrat Leader Jagmeet Singh showed this past week what authentic leadership looks like. He spoke from the heart directly to those hurt by experiences of racism. As the climate strike builds and protests happen around the globe, New Democrats will continue to show the importance of matching strong words with a commitment to real action to fight the climate crisis.    Poll Tracker Takeaway   Éric Grenier's weekly look at key numbers in the political public opinion polls.   It will take a while for the polls to begin registering the fallout from last week's revelation that Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau was photographed wearing blackface makeup on several occasions.  We'll start seeing data reflecting people's opinions over the next few days - but it could take a week or two before we can truly gauge the longer-term impact.  What's unlikely to change is the general make-up of the electorate — and a recent poll by the Innovative Research Group takes a fascinating approach to analyzing voters.  The poll, conducted over the first week of the campaign, included a breakdown of respondents divided between those who were committed to voting for one party and those who were still considering their options.    Reading this online? Sign-up for the newsletter to get it delivered to your inbox every Sunday – then daily during the campaign.    Outside of Quebec, the poll found that 29 per cent of the electorate is unaligned — that's the biggest single chunk of voters. These people are undecided or not yet committed to one party or another.  The next biggest group were ""Core Conservatives""; they represent 17 per cent of the electorate. The next biggest group, at 13 per cent, were those classified as ""Core Liberals.""  The other parties and swing voters made up smaller slices of the pie.  What's interesting about this poll is how it shows that the electoral playing field is far more nuanced than it might seem. For instance, outside of Quebec there are as many Liberal-Conservative swing voters as there are voters considering both the Conservatives and either the New Democrats or Greens.  There are more NDP-Conservative swing voters than Conservative-People's Party swing voters. There are twice as many Liberal-Green voters as there are Green-NDP swingers.  In Quebec, the Liberals appear to be competing for more voters with the Conservatives than with any other party. The Bloc Québécois needs to worry more about bleeding support to the Liberals or the Conservatives than to the New Democrats.  The biggest takeaway is that there are a lot of voters out there considering their options. Throughout the country, only 39 per cent of the electorate is considered ""core"" to one party or another. That means the rest is up for grabs — but in a way that's not as simple as we might think.

159,Nearly 700 workers temporarily laid off at St. Catharines GM plant,"Union officials say nearly 700 workers at the General Motors propulsion plant in St. Catharines were handed temporary layoff notices Friday.  Tim McKinnon, unit chairperson for Unifor Local 199, said the majority of the plant's workers will be off the job as of Monday.  About 450 workers will continue working on the transmission line, but their future is uncertain, too.  ""At the end of next week, if nothing changes with the UAW, it will probably put the entire plant out.""  The St. Catharines workers join thousands of others in Ontario's auto industry who have been temporarily laid off after United Auto Workers members at GM's U.S. operations walked off the job for the first time in more than a decade Monday. They walked out over issues that include wages, health care and job security.  GM has also halted production at its Oshawa Assembly Plant, leaving about 2,000 hourly employees off the job and creating a ripple effect among the suppliers who depend on it.    In an email to CBC News, a GM spokesperson confirmed the company had seen a ""disruption"" at its assembly plant in Oshawa due to the UAW strike, but that stamping operations in Oshawa and operations in Ingersoll and St. Catharines continued Friday.  ""We plan to resume these operations as quickly as possible upon resolution of the UAW strike,"" wrote Jacqueline Thomson.  McKinnon said the problem for workers in St. Catharines is that the V8 and V6 engines they produce at the plant ship to the U.S.  ""We don't have anywhere to ship"" during the strike, he explained.  The union representative said laid off workers will be able to access unemployment insurance — about 50 per cent of their wage.  Those who have been employed at the plant for six years or more qualify for supplementary pay that's about 65 per cent of their wage.  McKinnon added so far the situation has been going better than he anticipated.  ""People have resigned themselves to the fact this is what's going on. They're still pretty supportive of the UAW,"" he said, but noted that depends how long the strike drags on.  ""The only frustrating part is we're not in control of this, so you have no idea when it's going to end.""",business
129,"Andrew Scheer promises to review mortgage 'stress test,' allow for longer mortgages","Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer is promising that, if he's elected, he'll review the so-called ""stress test"" to help first-time homebuyers get approved for mortgages and allow people to take out longer mortgages for lower monthly payments.  The stress test, introduced by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) last year, is a financial bar that any Canadian looking to take out a mortgage must pass.  It requires that prospective homebuyers prove they can service an uninsured mortgage at a higher rate than they qualify for, in order to receive a loan from a federally regulated lender. The idea is to protect borrowers from taking on more debt than they can handle and ensure they have some financial leeway if rates rise.  The Conservatives are promising to review the application of the test for new buyers and are vowing to work with OFSI to eliminate it altogether from mortgage renewals.  Scheer said the test goes too far and has unintended consequences.  ""A new Conservative government will fix the stress test to make sure first time homebuyers can get access to a mortgage,"" he said while unveiling a housing plan Monday during a campaign stop in Vaughan, Ont. about 40 kms north of Toronto.    CIBC published a report earlier this year calling for a review of the stress test. In 2018, the total value of new mortgages fell by eight per cent, or $25 billion, it said. The report estimates the impact of the new stress test accounted for $13 billion to $15 billion of that drop — or 50 to 60 per cent.  But Ben Rabidoux, president of the market research firm North Core Advisors, said getting OSFI to change course is out of the government's hands.  ""There's some concern any time a politician talks about leaning on an arm's-length financial regulator, because they are supposed to be independent,"" he said.  ""I think that there's a valid criticism around that one piece of the stress test, this idea that it creates these captive borrowers. But to the extent that the promise is, 'We're going to really lean on OSFI,' I just think that's a bad precedent and a really bad look.""  Amortization changes  Scheer said a Conservative government also would allow people to take out 30-year mortgages, up from the current 25-year limit.  ""It is important that we have strong regulations around the financial sector to ensure that our housing industry and our mortgage industry is strong and robust, but we believe that for first-time home buyers a 30-year amortization period is appropriate,"" he said.  ""Young first-time home buyers often have their highest earning years ahead of them. And so, as they get promoted and as their incomes go up, they'll be able to carry the mortgages that they've gotten into.""  Former prime minister Stephen Harper initially raised the CMHC's mortgage amortization period to 40 years in 2006, before shortening it to 35 years in 2008, reducing it again to 30 years in 2011 and returning it to 25 years again in 2012.   Former finance minister Jim Flaherty said at the time that he was making the change in an effort to encourage Canadians to borrow responsibly.   'There is no silver bullet here'  The Conservative Party is also promising to launch an inquiry into money laundering in the real estate sector and make surplus federal real estate available for development.  The moves drew praise from some industry associations.  The Canadian Real Estate Association said the longer mortgage element would ""ultimately [provide] greater flexibility for home buyers looking at financing to purchase a home of their own.""  The Canadian Home Builders' Association, which had been pushing for changes to the stress test, said the announcement would help ""well-qualified first-time buyers that have been locked out of home ownership in recent years.""  Rabidoux said the Conservatives' plan has some good ideas but it's not clear if it would change the housing scene in Canada.  James Laird the President of CanWise Financial, a mortgage broker, welcomed the changes, saying that changing the mortgage to a 30-year amortization will allow Canadians to pay 10 per cent more for a house without their mortgage payments increasing.   Laird also applauded the move to scrap the stress test from mortgage renewals, saying ""There was no logic to the existing lender not having a stress test and the new lender having a stress test.""     ""There's no silver bullet here. But I mean, this is kind of what you'd expect a politician to say. They don't really move the needle,"" he said.  The Liberals revealed their housing plan on the first full day of the campaign, pledging to expand the First Time Home Buyer Incentive program introduced with this year's budget.  The program is available to first-time homebuyers who earn less than $120,000 a year, but under the expanded program those with incomes up to $150,000 would qualify.  In February, the Liberals announced plans to turn surplus federal properties into new affordable housing.  ""Andrew Scheer's only plan is a reckless recipe to increase the debt of Canadian households — and to hurt families by taking money out of their pockets and cancelling the Liberal First-Time Home Buyer Incentive,"" said Eglinton-Lawrence Liberal candidate Marco Mendicino in a statement.",politics
15,What the attack on Saudi oil facilities could mean for Canada's oilpatch and Keystone XL,"The secure supply of Canadian oil to the United States could recapture the attention of American decision-makers following the recent attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities, experts say.     Industry and government leaders around the world are still assessing the impact of Saturday's drone strikes on the state-owned Saudi Aramco facilities.   The attack disrupted about five per cent of global crude supplies, sending oil prices soaring.  The news also saw Canadian energy stocks surge by double digits during Monday's trading amid concerns the impact on oil markets could last months.     Canadian crude — overshadowed by soaring U.S. shale oil production in recent years — could receive greater focus with renewed discussion about secure energy supplies, said Rory Johnston,  a commodity economist at Scotiabank.    ""Historically, we've seen more of the sentiment toward the Canadian oil sector as being couched in terms of oil security, which as a concept has kind of fallen by the wayside,"" Johnston said.   ""This will likely raise that energy security narrative back to the forefront of public discussion, which all else equal, should benefit the Canadian oilpatch as a source of secure supply — politically secure and right next door to the United States.""  While Canadian pipeline constraints make it difficult for oil companies to get more Alberta oil to market currently, Johnston said, a shift in the conversation could fuel further political pressure to build projects like Keystone XL, which has struggled in the face of legal, environmental and political challenges in the U.S.     Drone attack in Saudi Arabia hits world's largest oil processing facility    ""It wouldn't necessarily accelerate the timeline of these types of projects being built,"" he said.   ""I think what this does is just lessens the risk that we're going to see further delays.""  Alberta 'the most secure major source of energy': Kenney  Aberta Premier Jason Kenney, who was in New York on Monday to meet with institutional investors, also emphasized the message that Alberta is ""the most secure major source of energy"" in the world.  ""The strike on Saudi refineries should be a wake-up call,"" he posted to social media.  Kenney was also reported Monday to be looking at easing mandatory oil production cuts in Alberta following those attacks.  American interest in secure supplies of oil from Canada was particularly strong after the terror attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, said Christopher Sands, an expert on energy policy at Johns Hopkins University in Washington, D.C.    That changed during the Obama administration, he said, with greater emphasis on the environment.  Sands said the situation with Saudi Arabia may have Americans looking at Alberta, but it could underscore for some lawmakers how important it is Canada build on its own pipeline capacity and ensure security of its oil.  ""You don't have enough capacity, and this makes us think you need redundant capacity because what if something goes wrong?"" said Sands, adding that ensuring the security of existing energy infrastructure is key.  Tim McMillan, president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, said the current situation in Saudi Arabia may provide more incentive to expedite projects like Keystone XL and Enbridge's Line 3, which would carry more oil from Alberta to the U.S.     Expect to feel oil price spike at the gas pumps    But he added that even with President Donald Trump ""pushing these projects, it has been a challenge with the U.S. court system and some of the other delay tactics that opponents are using.""  Though McMillan said he's confident those projects will be built, he added he was ""less confident"" that the U.S. legal system will move any faster.  ""But why on earth is Canada so beholden to the United States when we have the world's second-largest coastlines, where we have a close connection to the growing markets in Asia?"" he added.    While Canadian producers still face challenges in getting oil to market, whether by pipeline or by rail, Ian Nieboer, managing director at RS Energy Group, said they should benefit from higher oil prices.   The question everyone is trying to answer, he said, is how long will the situation last.  ""The outage itself and its duration is probably the first and most pronounced fundamental impact,"" he said.  ""The longer term and more structural piece is, is there some sort of risk premium [on oil prices] that maybe enters the market as you think about the politics of the Middle East and now really the circumstances that led to this weekend's attack,"" Nieboer said.  As for gasoline prices, Roger McKnight, chief petroleum analyst at En-Pro International, says it likely means higher gasoline prices in Canada as early as Wednesday. He said it's unclear how long it's going to last.      We have no idea … where this thing is going to go because it's completely out of anyone's control.  - Roger McKnight, chief petroleum analyst at En-Pro International     ""We have no idea … where this thing is going to go because it's completely out of anyone's control,"" McKnight said.  ""And the Saudis are going to keep things kind of close to the vest because they don't want to really upset the market completely. But the facts are facts. Five per cent of crude supply goes off the market, and prices have to go up.""",business
152,Where are Thomas Cook travellers stranded? Here's how 17 countries are responding,"British travel operator Thomas Cook ran hotels, resorts and airlines ferrying 19 million people a year to locations all around the world. But it went bankrupt over the weekend, and since it currently has 600,000 people abroad, that has forced governments and insurance companies to co-ordinate a huge operation to bring them all home.  Here is a summary of official responses to the Thomas Cook collapse:  United Kingdom  The U.K.'s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and government has lined up flights in order to begin bringing an estimated 150,000 Britain-based customers back home from vacation spots around the globe in what was called the biggest peacetime repatriation effort in the country's history.  British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was traveling to New York for a meeting at the United Nations, said the government was right not to bail out the company, arguing that doing so could have led other businesses to expect the same treatment.   France  French organization Entreprises de Voyage said that about 10,000 French tourists could be affected by the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook.  Norway  Norwegian subsidiary Ving said that currently 8,685 Norwegians are on its tours.  The Norwegian Travel Guarantee Fund, an insurance scheme that is compulsory for tour operators, issued a statement saying it will ensure any passengers traveling with Thomas Cook's Norwegian unit will be repatriated.  Denmark  Danish subsidiary Spies said that none of its planes will be leaving, and about 1,400 travelers are affected. A press contact in Thomas Cook said that affected travelers will get their trips refunded.  Finland  Thomas Cook unit Tjäreborg said it has 2,884 passengers traveling. ""We are currently doing all we can to arrange return flights for passengers and will provide more information during the day,"" the company said on its website.  Sweden  The Swedish unit Ving said the number of Swedish passengers currently away came to 16,956. ""We are now working intensely to ensure that all affected travelers are flown home with as little disruption as possible,"" the company said on its website.  Russia  The Russian tour operator subsidiary Intourist expects the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook will have no impact on clients, Russian executive director Sergei Tolchin told Interfax.  Germany  Thomas Cook holiday airline Condor says it will continue its flight operation despite its parent company's insolvency.  ""Condor … is continuing operations,"" the German airline said in a statement.  Thomas Cook says there are roughly 140,000 vacationers currently traveling with its German units.  The Netherlands and Belgium  As of Monday morning, the Netherlands and Belgium units of Thomas Cook were still operating.  Poland  The Polish unit Neckermann said its financial condition is stable and it continues to operate normally, with holidayers unaffected.  Greece  A Greek tourism ministry official told Reuters that about 50,000 tourists are stranded.  ""The top priority now is to get them back home,"" the official said, declining to be named.  Cyprus  Cyprus's deputy minister for tourism said arrangements are underway to ferry back home the 15,000 Thomas Cook travellers — half being U.K. citizens, 40 per cent hailing from Scandinavian countries and the rest being from Germany — on the eastern Mediterranean island nation.  ""We will work intensively …. I believe that a large portion of the arrivals we stand to lose will somehow be regulated by the market and other travel agencies,"" said Savvas Perdios, deputy minister of tourism to Reuters.  The company's clients represent about six per cent of Cyprus's annual tourist arrivals, or around 250,000 people.  Spain  Spanish Airport operator Aena says 46 flights operated by Thomas Cook have been cancelled in Spanish airports. Between 25,000 and 30,000 tourists are affected in the Canary Islands, according to local media.  Turkey  The Turkish Ministry of Tourism said more than 21,000 stranded travellers are now in Turkish hotels.  The ministry tweeted Monday that guest payments were guaranteed by the U.K.'s Air Travel Organiser's Licence. The statement warned there would be legal proceedings against hotels demanding payment from guests or forcing them to leave.  The Hotelier Federation head said about 45,000 tourists from the UK and Europe are in the country.  Egypt  Thomas Cook operator Blue Sky Group said that 25,000 reservations in Egypt booked up to April 2020 had been cancelled. Blue Sky currently has 1,600 tourists in Egypt's Hugharda resort  Tunisia  Tunisian tourism minister Rene Trabelsi told Reuters that 4,500 Thomas Cook customers are still on holiday in Tunisia. Meanwhile, Tunisia's government offered assurances that Thomas Cook clients won't be prevented from leaving the country, following British media reports that the Les Orangers beach resort in Hammamet, near Tunis, initially refused to let Thomas Cook clients leave.  A British vacationer told BBC radio on Sunday that security guards shut the hotel's gates, for fear it wouldn't be paid what it is owed by Thomas Cook.    But Tunisia's Tourism Ministry, cited by Tunisia's TAP news agency, denied Sunday that British tourists were sequestered at a Hammamet hotel. It said instead that ""checkout procedures were delayed for a while at the request of the hotel keeper.""   It said the British group later checked out and flew home ""after being given apologies for the delay.""   Gambia  Gambian Tourism Minister Hamat Bah told The Associated Press the government convened an emergency meeting to deal with Thomas Cook's collapse. People in the tiny West African coastal nation say the shutdown could have a devastating impact on their tourism, which contributes more than 30 per cent of GDP.",business
115,"Anti-carbon-tax stickers falling off gas pumps, Ford vows to fix the problem","Ontario Premier Doug Ford says the government's provincewide campaign to criticize the federal carbon tax just isn't sticking.  That's because the stickers decrying the tax, which gas stations are required by law to post on their pumps, were produced using the wrong adhesive and are falling off.  Ford joked about the issue at the International Plowing Match in Verner, Ont., on Tuesday, quipping that the stickers may have worked if they'd been produced by the label company owned by the Ford family.    But the premier acknowledged that the stickers were somehow botched and vowed to fix the problem.  He says the specifications were all accurate for the stickers, which became mandatory in Ontario gas stations at the end of August.    He offered few details, but said he would be discussing the matter with Energy Minister Greg Rickford.  ""It's like the shoemaker's daughter not getting shoes,"" Ford said of the mixup. ""They have to pull me off the ceiling when I hear they are coming off.""  Ford jokes Deco Labels should have made stickers  Ford later joked that the issue wouldn't have surfaced if the stickers had been produced by Deco Labels and Tags, the company co-founded by the premier's father. He said he would have happily donated Deco's services to produce the stickers, but that he was not allowed to do so.  Rickford's office did not immediately respond to request for comment on the situation.    The stickers are part of an aggressive campaign to critique the federal carbon tax, which Ottawa imposed on Ontario earlier this year after the province failed to come up with its own comparable regime.  The stickers show the amount of money the carbon tax is expected to add to a tank of gas over the next three years, but makes no mention of rebates the feds have put in place to offset the impact.  Opponents of the sticker campaign have accused the government of spreading propaganda.  The Federal Carbon Tax Transparency Act, which took effect on Aug. 30, said gas station operators who refuse to post the stickers could face daily fines. Ontario's Chief Justice set the fine amount at $150 per day.  Earlier this month, the Canadian Civil Liberties Association launched a legal challenge of the law alleging it violates free speech provisions of the Constitution.",technology
38,Model Naomi Campbell takes spotlight at London Fashion Week,"Model Naomi Campbell took centre stage at London Fashion Week on Saturday night with a gala charity benefit at the impressive setting of the world famous British Museum.  The Campbell-hosted event was the latest ""Fashion for Relief"" fundraiser organized by the well-known model, whose efforts are supported by a wide array of friends and designers. The first charity show was in 2005 in support of victims of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans.    At the event, the British Museum's steps and foyer became a red carpet staging area for fashionable elite who passed the time drinking chilled champagne and margaritas while last minute checks were made on the models' makeup and outfits.  Campbell said this year's benefit was to raise funds to protect vulnerable children throughout the world and help provide education and skills development. The black-tie event drew a huge and enthusiastic crowd, including many who stayed for a private dinner after the runway performance.    Actor Pierce Brosnan and actress Naomie Harris were among the star contingent, and the show was supported by a wide array of global fashion houses including Gucci, McQueen, Marc Jacobs and Vivienne Westwood.  Some of the outfits were clearly meant to be over the top, including mens' looks that seemed to bare all: many outfits did not cover the chest and most of the tops were sheer. Double-breasted suits were meant to be worn without shirts and costumes paired white vinyl shorts with clear tops.    Women were given more variety, including floral jumpsuits, beautiful black, tight-fitting dresses, one dramatic black pantsuit with puffy pink sleeves and shoulders, and Conehead style veils. There were also spiky overcoats, kimono-inspired ensembles, Russian-styled Rasputin outfits for men and glittery silver elbow-length gloves.    The gala capped a warm day filled with shows and presentations, including runway offerings by Alexa Chung and House of Holland and millinery by master hatter Stephen Jones.  Chung attracts adoring fans  An early start couldn't deter Chung's legions of loyal fans, who flocked to a Saturday morning show which included outfits that offered variations on her classic feminine themes.  Chung greeted fans with a video message featuring a montage of what she described as ""AC World."" She described the new styles as ""clothes to feel empowered in"" with a theme of ""female solidarity"" and said they were designed to ""get over heartbreak.""    The TV personality also offered a pep talk to her mostly youthful audience. ""Enjoy life, kids,"" she said. ""It's great.""  The collection featured a number of longer coats, including belted variations. Some were worn over slip dresses or beautifully constructed longer dresses. The colours were muted, with many variations of green and gray, and Chung paid homage to the American West with a denim dress that seemed to conjure up open skies and endless vistas.    There was a well-tailored double-breasted suit and some 60s-style jumpsuits, but no sign of Dynasty-style shoulder pads or power-dressing. Chung doesn't do flash, but she couldn't resist a few faux-snakeskin pieces.  Models wore mostly light makeup and flowing hairstyles to allow for a style that looked simple, easy and elegant rather than fussy or overdone.  Big names are still coming up, with shows scheduled by Burberry, Victoria Beckham, Christopher Kane and Julien Macdonald as Fashion Week reaches its glittery climax.",entertainment
49,Trudeau says he never told candidate-vetting committee about blackface because he was embarrassed,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says that when the Liberal Party was vetting him as a candidate, he never owned up to  the documented cases of blackface in his personal history.   ""I never talked about this. Quite frankly, I was embarrassed,"" Trudeau told reporters in Winnipeg Thursday. ""It was not something that represents the person I've become, the leader I try to be and it was really embarrassing.""  Trudeau offered no further details on how he navigated the party's process for vetting candidates or how he continued to hide his embarrassing past.   According to the party's rules for vetting candidates, a qualified nomination contestant ""has a continuing obligation to disclose to the national campaign chair any information that could impact upon their acceptability as a qualified nomination contestant or as a candidate of the party.   ""Failure to disclose such information constitutes non-compliance with these rules … and may result in the disqualification of a qualified nomination contestant.""    Trudeau said he did not tell his staff about his history of blackface until Time magazine told him it was about to reveal that in 2001 he attended an Arabian Knights gala at a private school in B.C., where he was a teacher, dressed in a turban with his skin darkened. The story included a photo from a school yearbook.  ""Ultimately, the call is mine on when to talk to people, when to act on things, and the buck stops with me and I take responsibility,"" he said.   All parties vet candidates  In an effort to avoid embarrassments like Trudeau's, candidates for all parties are vetted to unearth anything that could possibly derail their campaign or hurt the party.   The Liberal Party says its ""Greenlight Committee"" scrutinizes each prospective candidate to ensure a clean slate and its rules stipulate that candidates must not have ""engaged in any claim, litigation or dispute of any sort which is liable to bring controversy or disrepute upon the qualified nomination contestant or the party.""  Kaveh Shahrooz failed to secure the Liberal nomination for the Toronto-area riding of Richmond Hill in the 2015 federal election, losing out to Majid Jowhari, who went on to win the seat.       We don't have people going to campuses. That just doesn't happen.  - Michele Cadario     Shahrooz told CBC News that the committee had him fill out an extensive questionnaire detailing his background, views, education and financial information. After that, researchers for the party reviewed his social media history and then conducted a telephone interview.   ""Something like an old yearbook? I don't think that would have been caught in that greenlight process,"" said Shahrooz. ""If they don't offer up the information, I don't think that vetting 338 candidates it's possible to go and look at everyone's old yearbooks. At the candidate level it's hard to do.""  From vetting to crisis management  Jowhari may have won his seat, but within a year he was forced to apologize for misrepresenting his professional credentials as an engineer during the campaign. While he had qualified as an engineer, he was no longer licensed. To make amends he had to apologize and donate $5,000 to the Ontario Professional Engineers Foundation for Education.  Michele Cadario, the former federal campaign director for Paul Martin, helped oversee the vetting process for Martin's prime ministerial campaign. She said that unless a candidate freely reveals they have an embarrassing incident in their past that would not be picked up with a social media search, credit check or internet search, it's very hard to get a complete picture.   ""Unless something got flagged in that research. The idea of tracking down a yearbook or a newsletter or anything that's written, unless it's anything that's like a published article or a published book, or anything like that which would absolutely be read, but we don't have people going to campuses. That just doesn't happen.""    Cadario said that all issues that arise in vetting are dealt with on a case-by-case basis. If, for example, someone made a racist comment a year ago on social media, it would be treated differently than a drunk-driving conviction that was decades old and where candidate had worked hard to make amends.   ""We have a candidate survey that's fairly exhaustive that they have to go through,"" she said. "" A lot of it is based on asking them what they have been involved in, and what they've done and would be embarrassing to the party. We wanted them to acknowledge it.""  Cadario said that when candidates do not reveal past transgressions, such as Trudeau's blackface incidents, and those incidents are revealed after the candidate has been elected, it is no longer about vetting. The issue then becomes crisis management.",politics

31,Green Party told Elections Canada some voters' personal information was temporarily visible on party website,"The Green Party says it has notified Elections Canada that some voters' personal information was temporarily visible in internal training videos that were publicly accessible on the party's website.  According to a written statement from the party, the error was the result of an ""oversight.""

It said the information primarily pertained to names and addresses and included only a small number of voters.  CTV News first reported the problem after it said it discovered videos on the website used to train party workers on the party's voter data system, GVote.    The Canada Elections Act requires Elections Canada to make voter information available to political parties to communicate with voters, recruit party members and raise funds. Under the act, party staffers are allowed to use voter information for training purposes.  ""The act contains prohibitions and strict penalties for misuse of the lists of electors,"" Elections Canada said in an email to CBC News.

157,"U.K. tour operator Thomas Cook collapses, cancels all bookings","Veteran U.K. tour operator Thomas Cook has collapsed after failing to secure rescue funding, and travel bookings for its more than 600,000 global vacationers were cancelled early Monday.  The U.K. government said the return of the firm's 150,000 British customers now abroad would be the largest repatriation in its peacetime history. On Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said they have already begun a ""huge effort"" to bring home stranded tourists and passengers. He said future steps need to be taken so ""you don't end up with a situation where the taxpayer, where the state is having to step in and bring people home.""  The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said Thomas Cook has ceased trading, its four airlines will be grounded, and its 21,000 employees in 16 countries, including 9,000 in the UK, will lose their jobs.     Britain's CAA said it had arranged an aircraft fleet for the complex British repatriation effort, which is expected to last two weeks.  ""Due to the significant scale of the situation, some disruption is inevitable, but the CAA will endeavour to get people home as close as possible to their planned dates,"" the aviation authority said in a statement.  The 178-year-old company said Friday it was seeking £200 million ($331 million Cdn) in emergency funds to avoid going bust, and was in weekend talks with shareholders and creditors to stave off failure. The prominent firm, whose airliners were a familiar sight in many parts of the world, also operated around 600 U.K. travel stores.  Thomas Cook's struggle to adapt  Thomas Cook, which began in 1841 with a one-day train excursion in England and now operates in 16 countries, has been struggling over the past few years. It only recently raised £900 million ($1.5 billion), including receiving money from leading Chinese shareholder Fosun.  Analysts said Thomas Cook, which rode a package holiday boom that started in the mid-1980s, was too slow to react as consumers moved away from buying trips at bricks-and-mortar stores.   It has been overtaken by online services like Airbnb and internet travel companies who may separate or combine hotel, rental car and flight offerings, which puts pressure on prices through comparison shopping.   ""The company has struggled to adapt to a changing travel and retail environment,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK.   The company did push into online business, with 48 per cent of its bookings from the internet as of last year. But it wasn't fast enough. Online rivals didn't have to bear the costs of owning 200 hotels, 500 travel agency shops and 105 airline jets, but acted as middlemen.    Thomas Cook Group PLC isn't alone in facing such pressures. Competitor TUI Group AG, based in Hannover, Germany, has shifted its focus from tour operators to its own cruises and hotels.   But other factors laid into the British travel company.   Company officials have cited uncertainty over Brexit, both from consumers worried about its impact on their finances and from the timing, given that one unfulfilled deadline for Britain to leave the EU fell on March 31, just days before the heavy European Easter holiday travel season this year. Travel agents had to issue guidance on what would happen in case of a no-deal Brexit.  Brexit has meanwhile sent the pound lower, giving British travellers less purchasing power.     As the company struggled to reshape its business in the new environment and cut costs, it was hit with an unusually warm summer in 2018, which it said led travellers from the U.K. and Scandinavia to put off plans to head for warmer destinations. When they did decide at the last minute, the sector of the market that focuses on late decision makers turned out to be fiercely competitive on price.  ""The group, like its peers, has suffered from a perfect storm of turbulence, from political unrest and terrorism at some of its most popular destinations, to unusual weather patterns seeing travellers taking 'staycations' and the ever-present Brexit uncertainty devaluing the pound and putting consumers off from booking holidays,"" said Helal Miah, investment research analyst at The Share Centre.   In May, the company reported a debt burden of £1.25 billion ($2.07 billion), which gave the company less breathing room to manoeuvre.  ""While other travel groups have suffered from these factors, Thomas Cook's pile of debt is the differentiating factor,"" said Miah.  Most of Thomas Cook's British customers are protected by the government-run travel insurance program, which makes sure vacationers can get home if a British-based tour operator fails while they are abroad.  Like 'being held hostage'  The company's troubles had already started to affect those travelling under the Thomas Cook banner before the firm announced its collapse.  A British vacationer also told BBC Radio on Sunday that the Les Orangers beach resort in the Tunisian town of Hammamet, near Tunis, demanded that guests who were about to leave pay extra money for fear it wouldn't be paid what it is owed by Thomas Cook.  Ryan Farmer, of Leicestershire, said many tourists refused the demand, since they had already paid Thomas Cook, so security guards shut the hotel's gates and ""were not allowing anyone to leave.""  It was like ""being held hostage,"" said Farmer, who is due to leave Tuesday. He said he would also refuse to pay if the hotel asked him.  The Associated Press called the hotel, as well as the British Embassy in Tunis, but no officials or managers were available for comment.  Julie Robsson and her seven friends are due to fly out of Spain on a chartered Titan Airways plane to Manchester following the cancellation of their Thomas Cook flight earlier in the day.  The 58-year-old retiree from Yorkshire was ending a weeklong holiday on the Balearic Islands, about 250 kilometres south of Barcelona, and part of a group of some 300 tourists who were waiting on Monday for replacement flights.    Robsson said she was satisfied with the information received on the ground from the CAA and the British Consulate in Palma, the capital of the autonomous Spanish archipelago, but Thomas Cook's representative had not appeared in the group's hotel since the first rumours of the financial difficulties emerged last week.  ""I'm quite sad because it's an old company. The prices were all reasonable. The planes were clean,"" Robsson said, adding that after having used Thomas Cook's services for package holidays in Spain, Greece, Mexico and India, she was considering other alternatives now.",business
30,"Researchers using drones to document, study impact of Dorian on P.E.I. ","Researchers with the UPEI Climate Lab are using drone technology to get a rare glimpse from high above the devastation caused by Dorian.  The drone is capturing stunning images and videos of damage to Cavendish Campground, Cavendish's main beach and farms across the province after the post-tropical storm devastated Prince Edward Island last weekend and knocked out power for many communities.  ""If something terrible like this is going to happen anyway, we should take advantage as a learning opportunity and I think most importantly, is find out as much data as we can on the impact,"" said Stephanie Arnold, lead researcher with the lab.  ""So that we can make ourselves more resilient by preventing those impacts or at least lessening the damage of those impacts.""  Drones have been in the air at various locations across the Island to allow researchers to quickly — and safely — assess damage from the storm.    ""We're trying to capture as many footage as we can of the storm so that we can help farmers and the parks manage the aftermath,"" Arnold said. ""There's only so many flying days that we have, so we have all of our teams out flying as much as we can all over the Island.""  Arnold said while the view from the ground after a devastating storm like Dorian is heartbreaking, it's the view from the sky that's more revealing, particularly in Cavendish Beach in P.E.I. National Park.  ""The dunes look completely different,"" Arnold said. ""A lot of them, it looks like it was sheared right off, it was just a straight shear as opposed to a nice, soft dune.""    Staff have also been using the drones to survey damage to crops done by Dorian.   Information collected by the team will be shared with Parks Canada and farmers to help them adapt to extreme weather events and the impacts that storms like Dorian can have.    ""There are scientists working on creating new varieties,"" said Arnold. ""In the meantime, I'm also looking at how we can maybe manage our farm practices a little bit differently to prepare for really extreme weather events. There is some ways, maybe managing water. It's something we have to get better at just because the extremes are going to swing so widely and it's so unpredictable that it's not going to be easy.""  Researchers said they plan to do a before and after comparison of Cavendish Campground and the main beach.    ""We've captured footage of Cavendish main beach prior and now we have one for after,"" Arnold said. ""We have some before and after of farms as well. We've been so busy flying drones that we haven't had time in the office to do the analysis yet, but we're all very interested in how we can assess the damage.""    The research team will also fly over agricultural fields in Kings County to see if the rain caused any wash outs.  ""It's never fun to do post-storm assessment, but the fact that we have drones that we can use to gather data, it really helps us take a look at coastal changes, changes on farms and other ways of really better managing and preparing for weather events like this,"" Arnold said.

130,Maxime Bernier says addressing Indigenous water issues a 'first priority' if elected,"The leader of the People's Party of Canada says if his party gets elected, one of the first issues it will tackle is addressing boil water advisory issues in Indigenous communities across the country.  Maxime Bernier was in northern Ontario on Saturday to visit the International Plowing Match and campaign with Nipissing-Timiskaming candidate Mark King.  According to Indigenous Services Canada, 56 advisories remain in place across the country.  Bernier says he doesn't believe it's a matter of money to get the problem fixed.  ""The federal government is spending for First Nations about $20 billion a year. We'll keep that budget,"" he said.  ""But we will work with First Nations, with people on the reserve [as] they have the solution to that. The solution is not coming from Ottawa. Let's work with them. It's a question of bureaucracy. It's a question of bureaucrats not being efficient. It's not a problem of money. It's a problem of process and approving these projects.""    Bernier also spoke about other policies in his party's platform. He says his platform includes a plan to address Canada's labour shortage.  ""The solution is not only immigration, the solution is also automatization,"" he said.  ""We will abolish corporate welfare. We'll save $5 million there. But at the same time, we will have a flat tax on business at 10 per cent. We will abolish the capital gain tax in this country. The business entrepreneur will have more money in their pockets.""  Bernier says the changes would result in businesses having more money, meaning their workers could be paid more.  He also added that he plans to reduce the number of immigrants being allowed into the country, adding the screening process would be changed.  ""We want these people to integrate into our society,"" he said.  ""We want to be sure to have a face to face interview with these people, with every newcomer that will come to this country.

121,'The person that would change things': Montreal jazz icon Vic Vogel dies at 84,"Legendary Canadian jazz musician Vic Vogel has died at the age of 84.   He passed early Monday morning at his home in Montreal, next to his Steinway piano, which he had played since he was 16, according to a post on his Facebook page.  Victor Stefan Vogel, who became a pianist, conductor, composer, arranger and trombonist, was born in Montreal on Aug. 3, 1935.  ""Jazz is the thing I love,"" Vogel told Radio-Canada in a 1960s interview. ""It's powerful; it's alive. It's so much fun; it's interesting — ah!""   His work includes more than 2,000 pieces, arrangements and compositions; his name is on more than 60 albums, and he has given more than 10,000 performances.   Vogel is remembered by his friend and fellow prominent Montreal jazz musician Oliver Jones as ""a very unique musician who deserved an awful lot of respect.""    Mostly self-taught  ""He had some training, but most of everything he figured out on his own,"" Jones told Sabrina Marandola, host of CBC Montreal's Let's Go radio program. ""It's not easy in the jazz world.""  Jones met Vogel when he was 15 and Vogel was 14, when they were both accompanying singers and tap dancers at a local YMCA.   ""From that point on we were close friends for many many years,"" Jones said. ""I just thought the world of him as one of our greatest musicians.""    The ever-colourful bandleader was a fixture on the city's music scene for decades, playing at almost every Montreal International Jazz Festival, including the very first one in 1980.  A musician with a public profile since the age of 14, Vogel was mostly self-taught. He played in several dance orchestras in the 1950s, eventually conducting his own musical ensemble in 1960 at Club Chez Parée.     He then toured with the Parisian vocal group Les Doubles Six in 1961 and later, the Société Radio-Canada's jazz orchestra in 1966.   In 1968, he founded The Big Jazz Band, which he conducted for more than 50 years.   The album Vic Vogel and the Awesome Big Band entered the American Billboard chart in 1987.   Jones said Vogel was unafraid to forge new paths in music and always wanted to do something ""a little bit different.""  ""Vic was the person that would change things and end up doing something completely new for the first time,"" Jones said. ""He was very very unique as far as writing.""     ""I know there will always be a time when we'll say, 'I wish Vic was here to do this,'"" Jones said, offering his condolences to Vogel's family and friends.   Vogel shared the stage with more than 2,000 artists, among them some of the legendary musicians of all time.   They include Paul Anka, Sammy Davis Jr., Édith Piaf, Celine Dion, Michel Legrand, Jerry Lewis, Chucho Valdés, Maynard Ferguson, Oscar Peterson, Ella Fitzgerald, Phil Wood, Gerry Mulligan, Mel Tormé and Dizzy Gillespie.  In 2005, Vogel represented the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation as the European Broadcasting Union named him to compose, arrange and conduct the European Youth Jazz Orchestra, with which he toured in Europe and recorded an album in tribute to Oscar Peterson's 80th birthday.    Concordia University presented Vogel with an honorary doctorate in 2010, calling him a ""premiere musician and key force in establishing Montreal as a world jazz capital.""  ""I'm flabbergasted,"" he told CBC Montreal's evening radio program Homerun in 2010. ""Being a bit of a rebel all my life, I guess it's a way that society is accepting me into their folds, which is quite an honour.""  Vogel had a special affinity for Cuba, and Cuban music. In 2008, he told Homerun he would collect pianos and other instruments to send them to Cuba after large areas of the island sustained damage from hurricanes Gustav and Ike.",entertainment

173,"Liberals promise improved access to family doctors, mental health care and prescription drugs","The Liberals are promising to ensure all Canadians have access to a family doctor, mental health services and prescription drugs, but have released few details about how a re-elected Liberal government would implement a national pharmacare program or how much it would cost.  Promising to take the ""critical next steps"" toward a national pharmacare program, party background materials released to journalists say the Liberals are seeking a mandate to design and implement such a program and would negotiate with the provinces and territories to improve health care outcomes.  Holding a campaign event in Hamilton, Ont., Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau said Liberals ""believe in"" universal pharmacare as laid out by the advisory council report commissioned by his government. But he said it's not a decision for the federal government alone; it requires partnerships and negotiations across provinces and territories.  He took sharp aim at Ontario Premier Doug Ford and his cuts to health care programs, billing himself as the best leader to stand tough against Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer's provincial cousin through those negotiations.  ""So the question becomes for Canadians, 'Who do you want negotiating with Doug Ford when it comes to your health?'"" he said.    Ford's office said this year's provincial budget increased health spending by $1.3 billion.  ""He wants to change the channel from his situation he's facing and he's busy campaigning and that's fine. I'm busy governing and we're doing a great job turning this province around and putting money back into people's pockets and creating 230,000 jobs in the last year and four months,"" Ford told CBC News in Toronto.  ""So he can continue doing that. I'm going to continue focusing on the province.""    A statement from Ford's press secretary Ivana Yelich said it's ""categorically untrue"" to say Ford's government is cutting health care and insisted that his government has made landmark investments in health care and mental health services.  ""Premier Ford, along with his provincial and territorial counterparts, has asked the federal government to do its fair share to put patients first and strengthen our provincial health care systems across Canada by increasing the growth rate of the Canada Health Transfer to 5.2 per cent annually,"" she said.  ""We look forward to working with the federal government to ensure Ontario gets a fair and adequate share of the funding to support our province's health care needs.""    Scheer shot back that Trudeau would continue to run the country's finances as unpopular former Liberal premier of Ontario Kathleen Wynne did, and suggested that Trudeau is trying to deflect from his own record of big deficits and scandal.  ""He's desperate to run against anyone other than me,"" he said during a campaign event in Vaughan, Ont.  Scheer said a Conservative government would increase transfers for health and education by three per cent and accused Trudeau of lying to Canadians about his party's positions.  Council recommended universal pharmacare  In June, an advisory council appointed by the Liberal government recommended the establishment of a universal, single-payer public pharmacare system.  The council's 171-page report called for the creation of a new drug agency that would draft a national list of prescription medicines that would be covered by the taxpayer, beginning with an initial list of common and essential drugs, by Jan. 1, 2022.  The council recommended that the initial list be expanded to a comprehensive plan by Jan. 2, 2027. When fully implemented, the total cost would be about $15 billion a year, the council said.    Dr. Eric Hoskins, a former Ontario health minister and chair of the advisory council, acknowledged at the time there are ""significant incremental costs"" to building a pharmacare program, but he noted that those costs are already being picked up by Canadians.  The Liberal backgrounder released Monday with Trudeau's announcement says a re-elected Liberal government would also commit to establishing the Canada Drug Agency to make drug purchasing ""more effective and efficient,"" implement a national formulary with provinces, territories and other stakeholders to lower drug prices, and introduce a rare disease drug strategy to help Canadian families save money on high-cost drugs.  Drug pricing changes on the way  The federal government is also making changes to the way it will evaluate new drug prices in a move to try to save Canadians billions of dollars over the next 10 years.  In August, the government released changes to the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board, first set up in 1987 as a shield against high drug prices, which are set to kick in next July.  Under the new regulations, the board will no longer compare prices with the United States and Switzerland (which have some of the world's highest drug prices) when figuring out what companies are allowed to charge. It will still compare drug prices to France, Germany and Italy, and has added Japan, Spain, Norway, Australia, Belgium and the Netherlands to the list.    The Liberal health care platform also pledges to set clear standards for access to mental health services, and improve access to homecare and palliative care.  ""Every Canadian, no matter where they live, who they are or what they do, should receive the care they need to stay healthy,"" Trudeau said.  The Liberal Party says these measures would represent a $6 billion federal investment — what it calls an ""additional down payment"" — with details related to costing to be released ""over the course of the campaign.""  The Liberal Party has been criticized for not having every platform promise costed and publicly released by the Parliamentary Budget Officer, as the Conservative Party and NDP have done.    Today, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said the current system, which can diagnose a patient without offering subsidized medication, is ""illogical"" and ""irrational."" He said an NDP government would bring in a universal pharmacare program within just one year.  ""We've got the courage to take on big pharma. We've got the courage to take on the big insurance companies that don't want this program. But we know it's doable and it's so important,"" he said.  While Trudeau appeared to hedge on the exact model of pharmacare that would ultimately be adopted, Linda Silas, president of the Canadian Federation of Nurses Unions, took from the announcement that Liberals would bring in a universal program, rather than a limited one. She said access to prescription medication should be guaranteed, just like access to hospitals and doctors.    ""As nurses, we've been advocating for universal pharmacare for decades, because we see first-hand how our patients are suffering and how our system is squandering precious resources that could be reinvested in home care, long-term care, primary care, mental health and acute care,"" said Silas in a statement.  ""Study after study has confirmed universal drug coverage is the most efficient, economical and equitable option for Canada.""",health

78,Ontario teen was on life-support after respiratory illness linked to vaping,"An Ontario teenager was put on life-support after using a vaping device in what public health officials say is the first reported case of illness linked to the practice in Canada.  Officials with the Middlesex-London Health Unit were alerted by a local doctor after the high school student fell ill and was sent to hospital.  ""The individual was using e-cigarettes at least daily,"" said Dr. Chris Mackie, the region's medical officer of health.  ""We have information about the brand used.""  That information is not being released but has been passed to Canada's chief medical officer of health who will be gathering systematic data to determine if one vaping device is more potent than another.  ""We're not releasing information about the brand information because that would imply that this is something coming from one brand, when clearly looking at the international evidence, that's not the case,"" Mackie said.  Mackie said the teen has been released from hospital and is doing well.      It's important that people understand vaping does create health risks.  - Dr. Chris Mackie     ""There are some who claim that vaping is not a risk in Canada,"" he said. ""That is not the case. It's important that people understand vaping does create health risks.""  There have been hundreds of such cases in the United States, but this is believed to be the first case of severe pulmonary illness linked to vaping in Canada.   ""We know very little about the long-term health effects associated with e-cigarettes, but our findings so far are enough to convince us of the need to advise the public,"" Mackie said.  Mackie did caution that it's impossible to 100 per cent confirm the youth's illness was caused by vaping, but said there was no other evidence to suggest it was caused by something else.     ""There was no other cause — no infectious cause,"" he said. ""The only issue identified is that the individual vaped e-cigarettes.  The health unit says it will not disclose the age, gender or hometown of the patient, claiming confidentiality.   The news comes on the same day as the Ontario health minister ordered public hospitals to report vaping-related cases of severe pulmonary disease.   Use 'escalating' among youth  It also follows a directive from Health Canada to health-care professionals, telling them to ask patients about their vaping use and if they have any trouble breathing or shortness of breath.   ""The use of these products is escalating at a rate we've never seen,"" said Linda Stobo, the Middlesex-London Health Unit's manager of chronic disease prevention and tobacco control team. ""Our enforcement officers have seen an exponential increase in the number of students who vape, particularly high school-aged youth, which is a major concern for us.""   Stobo said the e-cigarettes are marketed in a way that targets a young demographic including:     Sleek designs with options to customize the look, including different colours.   Hundreds of flavours of e-juice, including candy, designed to attract youth.    Marketing that uses words such as ""bold,"" ""stylish,"" ""attractive"" and ""try it.""   Some vaping devices can be charged using a computer or cellphone charger, making them enticing to a generation already enamoured with technology.     Stobo also said she's worried about the high concentrations of nicotine found in some of the products. She also said local schools are reporting students vaping in washrooms, classrooms and even buses.    Selling vaping products to those under 18 isn't allowed in Canada, but Health Canada wants to strengthen rules to limit the visibility of vaping ads to young people.   Some proponents of vaping insist it can be an effective way to prevent people from smoking tobacco, or a way to help smokers quit cigarettes.     Mackie, however, said it can often work the other way. That someone not interested in smoking may start with vaping then transfer over to cigarettes because they're cheaper.    ""If you start people on smoking e-juice … then when they run out of money the smoking behaviour starts up,"" he said.   In the United States, there have been hundreds of cases of respiratory illnesses linked to vaping and at least seven deaths. Many of those deaths were linked to vaping cannabis. Mackie wouldn't say whether cannabis was a factor in the London, Ont., case.     ""The information we have … is that there's no particular brand that has been implicated, and there's no particular link with cannabis or not,"" he said. ""There are cases where cannabis has been involved and cases where it hasn't been.   India on Wednesday moved to ban the production, import and sale of electronic cigarettes.  However, the London-Middlesex case is believed to be the first reported in Canada.",health
174,Toronto approves strategy to combat anti-vaccination as parents accuse city of 'genocide',"Tensions flared at Toronto city hall on Monday as a large group of anti-vaccination parents protested against the city's decision to adopt a new vaccination strategy.  The recommendation by Dr. Eileen de Villa, Toronto's medical officer of health, calls for a new public health strategy to address ""vaccine hesitancy."" It includes a proposal that would prevent students from skipping vaccines for non-medical reasons.  The growing movement against vaccines includes the reluctance or refusal to vaccinate due to concerns about possible side effects, including serious injuries and death.  Most of the recommendations will need to be approved by the provincial and federal governments.  The City of Toronto estimates that around 20 per cent of parents in the city are vaccine hesitant.  On Monday morning, the plan to combat that trend was unanimously approved by the Board of Health.   The decision came after several Toronto residents vociferously demanded that the board reject the plan due to concerns that vaccinations are dangerous.    'My body, my choice'  People attending the meeting shouted ""shame"" and ""genocide"" after the vote was taken.  ""I do not consent to having myself nor my children force-vaccinated, drugged and medically induced in order to attend public schools in Canada,"" said Emanuela Caires during her deputation.  ""I am not willing to subject this type of harm over benign childhood illnesses,"" added the mother of three unvaccinated children.  Catherine Condinho, an unvaccinated student, said the plan would take away her freedom of conscience and religion.  ""This is my body, my choice,"" she said to the cheers of supporters, who filled the meeting room and city hall's atrium.    De Villa's report includes a range of recommendations to ""improve vaccine acceptance,"" including removing exemptions, improving digital immunization records and developing a vaccine injury compensation fund.  The case for vaccinations  ""Vaccines work, full stop,"" said Board of Health chair Joe Cressy. ""There is an abundance of scientifically proven evidence demonstrating just that.""  Most medical experts consider vaccinations safe and effective at preventing the spread of many harmful illnesses.    ""Vaccination is one of the world's greatest public-health achievements, along with sanitation, antibiotics and clean drinking water,"" according to Health Canada.  Cressy pointed to recent measles outbreaks in Canada, the United States and Europe as proof that vaccine hesitancy has potentially dangerous outcomes.  He said the plan will help Toronto prevent similar outbreaks, rather than reacting to them after they occur.  ""People have the fundamental right to believe what they want, but they do not have the right to endanger others,"" Cressy added.    Last year, 1.72 per cent of Toronto students did not receive mumps and rubella vaccines due to philosophical and religious exemptions, up from 0.8 per cent in 2007.  While answering questions from board members, de Villa acknowledged that serious reactions can occur after vaccines are administered, though those instances are rare.  ""That doesn't take away from the fact that [vaccines] are one of the most significant life-saving interventions that has occurred in medical history,"" she said.  While the recommendations were unanimously approved Monday, the provincial government previously indicated that it has no plans to update provincial regulations.  Under the Immunization of School Pupils Act, children are required to have proof of immunization for certain diseases to attend school in Ontario, unless there is a ""valid medical exemption or affidavit of conscience or religious belief,"" said health ministry spokesperson Travis Kann.",health
181,Next frontier in medical fundraising? Toronto man turns to boot camp to help raise $3M for son's rare disorder,"The latest stop in Terry Pirovolakis's journey to cure his son's rare genetic disorder is a boot camp: an intense, all-day session on how to win grants to fund expensive medical research.  It has now become part of how the Pirovolakis care for 21-month-old Michael.  There are the conventional appointments, like physio and occupational therapy. But the disease their son has is so rare and there is no treatment, leaving his parents with only one choice: to fund research to find a cure themselves — at a cost of about $3 million.  Michael Pirovolakis is believed to be the only child in Canada diagnosed with spastic paraplegia type 50, or SPG50, a disorder caused by a missing gene.  It threatens to degenerate the toddler's brain, which could rob him of his ability to move, speak and even breathe. But gene therapy may be able to halt — maybe even reverse — the degeneration that has already set in.    There are only 57 known cases of SPG50 in the world, including Michael, according to pediatric neurologists at Boston Children's Hospital.  This week, Terry Pirovolakis was in San Diego at conference called the Global Genes Summit, learning how to raise the money he needs to fund a clinical trial.  ""If we're going to make $3 million, we need support, we need to hear from experts that have raised $20, $40, $50 million,"" he said. ""How they did it, what worked, what didn't. We almost have to become experts at fundraising.""  Community help  The Pirovolakis, who live in Toronto, have already become adept in community fundraising. Michael was diagnosed with SPG50 in April, and since then, the family has raised thousands by liquidating their savings, as well as through public events and donations via GoFundMe.  Their community has held all kinds of fundraisers big and small; their neighbourhood is blanketed in signs raising awareness of the cause.  ""[It] makes us hopeful and shows us how good people can be. The generosity is amazing,"" said Michael's mother, Georgia Pirovolakis.  People show up the the Pirovolakis's door with cash and cheques. One little girl brought her tooth fairy money. Other children have donated their allowances and set up lemonade stands.    ""The cutest is the little kids,"" Georgia said. ""It was just so heartwarming to see.  ""To see little kids helping little kids is just amazing. To those parents raising the children, I give them nothing but thanks and props for being such amazing parents and sharing the love and teaching them that they should help and give back.""  While the family tries to overcome the daunting hurdle of raising millions, the biggest enemy is actually time. The longer it takes for the treatment to be funded, the greater the risk Michael will lose the ability to move. It's why his parents are trying every avenue to raise the money.    The boot camp Terry Pirovolakis attended at the Global Genes Summit showed participants how to write proposals to get funding from foundations. It also covered partnering with companies and legal matters, including managing intellectual property.  The broader conference focused on networking, with sessions geared to helping patients and their families push research forward. There were workshops titled ""Rare Disease Research: Getting Your Disease Noticed"" and ""Developing Partnerships Among Rare Communities and Individual.""  The clinical trial  The money raised by the Pirovolakis so far — about $665,000 — is funding the first phases of a clinical trial at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, Texas.  Researchers there have created a virus that will transport that missing gene to Michael's brain. It could cure him, they say, but more testing needs to be done. So more money is needed.    Without parents fundraising to get treatments for rare diseases, the research ""just wouldn't get done,"" said Steven Gray, an associate professor and researcher at UT Southwestern Medical Center.  ""This is the only way that things move forward for a rare disease,"" said Gray. ""It makes it very personal for me and makes it worthwhile for us to go in the lab every day and do what we do.""  'Willing to go anywhere'  ""I'm willing to go anywhere,"" Terry Pirovolakis said. ""From the very beginning of this journey, I told the doctors I'm willing to do anything, give up everything, if I have to. And this is part of that journey.""  For now, what is keeping Terry going is imagining the day when they've raised enough money and Michael gets the experimental treatment.  ""I envision that day, yes,"" he said, choking back tears. ""And then that moment after, where he does the hard work to gain the stuff he's lost. Absolutely.""    Georgia Pirovolakis says it's sometimes harder for her to visualize that day, as she watches her son struggle through all the different therapy appointments.  ""I have days where I can't see it. Because I'm with him all the time, and I see him struggle, and I see him trying so hard. And sometimes it's hard for me to envision that moment,"" she said.  ""Terry is more positive than me, but $3 million is a long way away. I hope it comes, I pray it comes. But when will it come, right?  ""We'll get there. We'll get there.""",health
180,Sleep congress shines light on women's struggle with insomnia ,"Frustration: that's the word Vancouverite Jacqueline Sinclair uses most often to describe her insomnia.   There's the frustration of lying in bed, awake in the middle of the night, knowing how crappy she'll feel the next day. The frustration of struggling to relax as she lies awake. And the frustration of failing at what should be a basic life skill.   ""Knowing that the rest of the world is able to do something as simple as sleep ... it's frustrating,"" said Sinclair, 50, who works from home doing administration for the family's construction business.  Sleep has eluded Sinclair for the past 10 years. As remedies, she has cut out caffeine, sugar and gluten. She has tried herbal teas, homeopathy and vitamins. CBD oil and prescription sleeping pills have been helpful, but they each had worrisome side effects.   ""I'm not sure what's next,"" she said. ""I hope I go to bed tonight and sleep for six hours straight. Wouldn't that be fantastic?""    Dr. Ram Randhawa, a psychiatrist at the University of British Columbia's Sleep Disorders Program, says about 30 per cent of Canadians struggle with getting to or staying sleep at any given time. The prevalence of insomnia does seem to be higher among women, he said.  For most people, sleep issues are a temporary problem brought on by stress or worry. For some, they can be a debilitating, life-long problem.     Increasingly, doctors and sleep experts recognize that insomnia and other sleep disorders affect women and men differently. At the World Sleep Congress in Vancouver this week, women and sleep is one of a handful of key topics.   Dr. Ghada Bourjeily, a professor of medicine at Brown University in Rhode Island and chair of the course on sleep health for women at the conference, says women have historically been underrepresented in medical research, including research on sleep disorders.    Women face unique biological circumstances that can disrupt sleep at different times in their lives, Bourjeily says — beginning when they get their periods, to when they become pregnant and eventually go through menopause.   ""There's a lot that we seem to be learning about these things,"" she said.    Deeper understanding  Randhawa, with UBC's Sleep Disorders Program, will also be presenting at the conference.   He says UBC's sleep clinic has a long wait list of people eager to get help, and many of them are women who have trouble falling or staying asleep.   He agrees that sleep issues manifest differently in men and women. While sleep apnea is more likely to affect men, for example, women are more prone to conditions that can affect sleep like restless leg syndrome, anxiety and depression.    Randhawa says it's important for doctors to develop a well-rounded profile of a patient's circumstances and the problems they face, including family pressures like child-rearing and housework.   ""If I can develop a better understanding of that particular person's issue of what it is that they are struggling with, and how that has affected them, that will allow me to help them better,"" he said.  Randhawa says women who attend his clinic can also request one of three female psychiatrists who work there, if they prefer someone they think might be more understanding of their situation.    Validating patients' concerns  Lianne Tomfohr-Madsen, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Calgary who will present her research on insomnia and pregnancy at the congress, says some doctors can be dismissive of women's sleep issues.  Tomfohr-Madsen is working to help doctors differentiate between normal sleep disturbances during pregnancy, like physical discomfort and frequent nighttime urination, from more serious issues.   ""We often aren't differentiating what those normal changes look like from what's actually really clinically significant and bothersome to women,"" she said    Some pregnant women feel disregarded when they discuss their sleep issues with their doctor, Tomfohr-Madsen says, and that may lead them to seek remedies through alternative medicine or over-the-counter medication that could be harmful to their unborn child.   Tomfohr-Madsen advises doctors to not dismiss their patient's concerns and focus on finding solutions, of which she says there are many.  ""People often know that their sleep is a problem,"" she said. ""We want to validate that this isn't something normal, and it's a problem, and that it's something that we can work on.""",health
32,Facebook advertisers can write their own headlines for shared news stories,"Advertisers on Facebook are able to completely rewrite the displayed headline for news stories, CBC News has learned, opening the door for potential disinformation to spread on the platform while using news media branding as cover.   When placing an ad on the platform, one option is to include a link to a website, including links to news stories. The news story's real headline is auto-filled into the ad copy, but advertisers have the option to rewrite the headline. However, the article's website address still appears in the ad, giving the impression that the headline is the one written by the article's author.  This policy raises the possibility that it could be abused by political parties or third-party advertisers during the federal election campaign.  ""This is essentially, it would be a situation where Facebook is hosting and allowing and accepting monies for a misleading, essentially, political ad or a political weapon, at that point,"" said Jennifer Grygiel, an associate professor of communications at Syracuse University.  ""Any time that you can present a story as being different than it is, there's an opportunity for it to be abused,"" said Aleksander Essex, a professor of computer science at Western University in London, Ont. ""What you see and what's displayed to you online can potentially be changed in a number of ways. In this case, it sounds like Facebook is explicitly allowing it out of carelessness.""  Facebook is aware of the issue and said it is planning changes.  ""We have a system that gives publishers control over how their links appear on Facebook. We're working to put additional safeguards in place by the end of this year to make sure advertisers don't misuse this tool,"" said a Facebook spokesperson in an email to CBC News.    Before 2017, Facebook users and page administrators could change headlines of the articles they shared on the platform, allowing them to dramatically alter the way the articles were presented.   This function was abused by people looking to sow confusion and misinformation. One CBC article with a fake headline that included vulgar language circulated widely in 2015. Because the link included a CBC URL, many users believed the headline was real. A social media editor wrote a piece to clarify the headline was false.   Facebook removed the ability to alter headlines in June of 2017 as part of its efforts to limit the spread of disinformation. But there is one exception to this rule: pages which purchase ads can still modify an article's headline, as long as it's part of an advertising campaign.   In fact, this very tactic was recently used in the UK. That country's Conservative Party ran an ad in the first week of September containing a BBC article whose headline was, ""£14 billion pound cash boost for schools"".     There was one problem: the article's title had been modified by the party.  The actual BBC story is headlined ""School spending: Multi-billion pound cash boost announced,"" and instead put the number at £7.1 billion, criticizing the government's use of £14 billion pound figure as not the usual way of calculating spending.  ""Describing this as a £14bn increase would make the government seem more generous than it is in fact being"", wrote BBC head of statistics Robert Cuffe in the article.  In all, the UK's Conservative Party ran five different versions of this misleading ad, reaching a potential audience of 222,000 to 510,000 Britons. The ad is no longer active, and when searching for it in the Facebook Ad Library, users get a message that the ad did not conform to Facebook advertising standards and has been taken down. It's still possible to view the original ad.  Since then, the Conservative Party told the BBC: ""It was not our intention to misrepresent by using this headline copy with the news link, where the BBC's £7bn figure is clearly displayed, but we are reviewing how our advert headlines match accompanying links.""    According to Grygiel, this shows a failure of Facebook's ad service.   ""They should be building product in a way that is not democracy damaging,"" they said.  Grygiel said it is Facebook's responsibility to create advertising infrastructure that wouldn't allow advertisers to change headlines on articles. They pointed out that Facebook has a higher standard of what it will allow for advertising, because people can't opt out of it.  ""Because, again, these are people who are being targeted and this content is being forced on a viewer, as an ad, and so it has a higher threshold of accountability. So, they need to do better,"" they said.    A 2016 study by a team of researchers at Columbia University found that 59 per cent of links shared to Twitter had never been clicked, suggesting that a considerable number of users share articles without reading them. Another survey conducted in 2014 by the American Press Institute suggested that only four out of 10 Americans sought to ""go for more in-depth news, beyond the headlines"" in a given day.",technology
198,Scientists set sail on yearlong expedition to Arctic centre,"Researchers from more than a dozen nations launched Friday the biggest and most complex expedition ever attempted in the central Arctic — a yearlong journey through the ice they hope will improve the scientific models that underpin our understanding of climate change.  The 140-million euro ($158 million Cdn) expedition will see scientists from 19 countries including Germany, the United States, Britain, France, Russia and China work together in one of the most inhospitable regions of the planet.  ""The Arctic is the epicentre of global climate change,"" said Markus Rex of Germany's Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Ocean Research, who is leading the expedition. ""At the same time the Arctic is the region of the planet where we understand the climate system least.""  Packed full of scientific equipment, the German icebreaker RV Polarstern set sail from the port of Tromso in northern Norway, accompanied by a Russian vessel to search for a suitably large floe on which to anchor and set up base.  As the days get shorter and the sea freezes around it, the Polarstern will slowly drift off on its own toward the North Pole while rotating teams of dozens of scientists spend two months each conducting research on the ice.      The Arctic is changing pretty dramatically right now and that's something we need to get into.  - Matthew Shupe, Univeristy of Colorado atmospheric scientist     Stefanie Arndt, a sea ice physicist who has been preparing for the expedition for nine years, said darkness will be the biggest challenge.  ""Everyone worries about the cold, but the psychological aspect of not seeing anything and knowing there are polar bears out there is something that shouldn't be underestimated,"" she told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.   Scientists involved in the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate, or MOSAiC for short, have undergone firearms training. The camp will be also be secured by a perimeter fence and fireworks to scare off prowling predators.    Arndt, who will join the mission in mid-February, said the unique advantage of MOSAiC compared with other expeditions is the fact that researchers will be able to observe processes in the Arctic across an entire seasonal cycle.  ""What's particularly interesting is the transition from winter to spring,"" she said, a time when the ice is normally too thick for ships to reach the central Arctic.     Recording changes in the density, size and type of snow will help scientists better understand the flows of energy in the Arctic.  ""For example, how much light the snow reflects back into the atmosphere, how much it absorbs and how much light reaches the upper ocean,"" said Arndt. ""This has big implications for the ecosystem.""  Energy from light affects algae growth and ocean temperatures, which in turn influence how much sea ice melts from below.  Understanding these and other complex processes occurring in the Arctic is essential for the increasingly sophisticated computer models scientists use to predict weather and climate. Experts believe that any disruption to the Arctic's delicate cycle of freeze-and-thaw will be felt further south, though it's still not clear how.      We're doing it because we can, and nobody else can do it.  - Markus Rex, Expedition lead     ""The Arctic is changing pretty dramatically right now and that's something we need to get into,"" said Matthew Shupe, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Colorado who will take part in the expedition.  Recent changes in the jet stream — a current of air that circles and insulates the Arctic like a giant thermos — have allowed warm, moist winds from low latitudes to move north. At the same time, chilly blasts of Arctic air — the dreaded polar vortices — have brought deep freeze conditions to the continental U.S. and Europe.  ""A lot of this right now is a hot topic,"" said Shupe.     Concerns about global warming have spread far beyond the scientific community in recent years. The expedition started on the same day as global climate protests and ahead of a U.N. climate summit in New York next week.  Rex, the expedition head, said the co-operation between scientists from many different countries stands in contrast to the geostrategic jostling that big powers have started engaging in as the Arctic, with its untapped riches, begins to open up to exploration.  Germany finances half of expedition's cost  He put the fact that Germany, hitherto a second-league player in the Arctic, is leading the expedition down to the country's technical and logistical expertise.  ""We're doing it because we can, and nobody else can do it,"" said Rex.    Anja Karliczek, the German minister for science, said that as a major industrial nation, Germany needs to shoulder part of the responsibility for tackling climate change, and financing half of the expedition's costs was in the country's interests.  Unlike Russia, China and Sweden, which will also be sending icebreakers to supply the expedition, the United States won't be contributing a vessel.  ""A U.S.-flagged ship would have been a nice addition to MOSAiC,"" said Shupe.  ""On the other hand I think that the U.S. is making extraordinary contributions,"" he said, citing scientific and financial support from American institutions such as the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and NASA.",technology

213,"Greta Thunberg has talked about a 'carbon budget.' What is it, and why does it matter?","Hello, people! This is our weekly newsletter on all things environmental, where we highlight trends and solutions that are moving us to a more sustainable world. (Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Thursday.)  This week:     What do we mean by a 'carbon budget'?   Crowdfunding to preserve B.C. coastal wilderness   What you can do to save the birds      The carbon budget: What it is, why it matters    ""If we are to have a 67 per cent chance of limiting the global temperature rise to below 1.5 degrees [C], we had, on Jan. 1, 2018, 420 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide left in our CO2 budget. And of course, that number is much lower today. We emit about 42 gigatonnes of CO2 a year. At current emission levels, that remaining budget is gone within 8 1u002F2 years.""  Those words were delivered by youth climate activist Greta Thunberg to the French parliament on July 23, 2019. She said she has not heard much on the subject of a ""carbon budget,"" either from politicians or the media. But what's left in our carbon budget is of utmost importance if we hope to limit global warming.   Simply put, this budget refers to how much carbon — which includes CO2 and other greenhouse gases like methane — we can emit into the atmosphere before we pass the point of warming the Earth to 1.5 C or 2 C.  The carbon budget was discussed in the first of three special reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), released in October 2018. The final instalment, the Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC), will be discussed in Morocco this weekend, with a summary due to be released next Wednesday.  The Paris Agreement seeks to limit a global temperature rise to 2 C above pre-industrial levels this century (with a goal of keeping it to 1.5 C). The key to understanding the carbon budget is that even if countries keep in line with the Paris accord, if the budget is depleted by then, it won't matter. The damage will already be done. And it will be irreversible.  ""If you think about annual emissions and reducing emissions without thinking about the carbon budget, you could really blow past the Paris Agreement,"" said Brenda Ekwurzel, director of climate science at the U.S.-based Union of Concerned Scientists. ""That's the trouble.""  After a few years of stable global CO2 emissions, they rose in 2018, and there are concerns they may rise again in 2019.  If we don't pay attention to the carbon budget, it increases the chance of a host of global problems: the loss of coral reefs, no summer sea ice in the Arctic, more severe weather events and changes in crops that could lead to further food scarcity.  If it sounds dire, Ekwurzel said we have the power to change the trajectory.   ""Whenever we've been faced with a problem before and really … lean into it, we make big changes,"" Ekwurzel said. ""And a lot of those changes we're calling for, we can do.""  She said we need to look at deep de-carbonization of our energy supply, as well as doing ""nature-based enhancements,"" including the expansion and protection of carbon sinks such as forests, wetlands and mangroves, as well as seagrass. Ekwurzel stresses that economists say the transitions are economically feasible.   Like Greta, Ekwurzel said it's time that everyone — governments, organizations, businesses, and yes, consumers — begin to pay more attention to that budget that is nipping at our heels. She insists that together, we can make a difference.  ""Yeah,"" Ekwurzel said. ""We can do this.""  — Nicole Mortillaro    Reader feedback  The period between Sept. 20 and 27 is shaping up to be quite significant for climate action, with a major summit at the United Nations and major climate strikes planned for the next couple of Fridays. Will you be taking part in the strikes? Let us know.  Email us at whatonearth@cbc.ca.  Old issues of What on Earth? are right here.      The Big Picture: Crowdfunding land preservation  Late last month, a group of concerned citizens raised enough money to buy 800 hectares of wilderness on B.C.'s Sunshine Coast. The crowdfunding campaign operated by the B.C. Parks Foundation, an independent charity that works with B.C. Parks, raised $3 million to buy the expanse of land in Princess Louisa Inlet from a private seller. The aim of this purchase? Preservation. Andrew Day, CEO of B.C. Parks Foundation, said the organization wants to save the land from logging and other development. Said Day, ""We'll do our best to make sure that that area stays protected forever.""    Hot and bothered: Provocative ideas from around the web      In a sign that he is raising the stakes on climate action, United Nations secretary general Antonio Guterres has barred leading economies such as Japan and Australia from speaking at the UN's upcoming climate change summit because they're building new coal power plants.     Climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe, who is employed by Texas Tech University, is one of the most lucid and important voices in the global discussion about climate action. She's also Canadian, and this week she was named a United Nations Champion of the Earth, the UN's highest environmental honour.    Sun-rich Egypt has built one of the world's biggest solar installations, and it is about to go live. The 1.8-gigawatt array contains more than seven million panels and will be visible from space.      What you can do to save the birds    A new study, led by Ken Rosenberg at the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, has found there are three billion fewer birds in North America than there were in 1970. The Canadian and U.S. researchers behind the study say that habitat loss is likely the main cause, and conservation can make a difference, as shown by the increased populations of waterfowl and birds of prey.  But besides lobbying the government and donating money to conservation groups, there are also individual actions people can take to help protect birds.  Here are seven things the researchers, and the bird conservation and research groups that support them, suggest through their website 3billionbirds.org.  Reduce the chance that birds will hit windows. Use film, paint or string to break up reflections to prevent daytime collisions. And turn lights out at night.  Keep cats indoors. Cats are the second-highest human-related cause of bird declines after habitat loss, the researchers say. Keep cats indoors, or in an enclosed ""catio"" or on a leash when outdoors.  Replace your lawn with native plants. Native plants can provide shelter, nesting areas and food for birds — such as nectar, seeds and berries — that grass doesn't. You can find more info on ""greener"" lawn alternatives here.  Avoid pesticides. Pesticides can harm seed-eating birds that accidentally eat treated seeds, as well as indirectly damage insect-eating birds by killing their food source.  Buy shade-grown coffee. To grow coffee in the sun, farmers often clear forests that migratory birds need for food and shelter. Shade-grown coffee preserves that forest. The Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center has even created a certification for ""bird-friendly coffee"" that includes organic and fair trade standards.  Cut back on plastics. Studies show that at least 80 seabird species mistake plastic for food, the researchers say.   Watch birds and help track them. Anyone can participate in citizen science projects like Project FeederWatch, the Christmas Bird Count or the Breeding Bird Survey, which was key to generating the data in the study. Apps like eBird can make it easy to submit your everyday sightings. You can learn more about nature apps here.

185,Conservatives promise to spend $1.5B to buy new medical imaging equipment,"Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer promised Friday to spend $1.5 billion to buy new medical imaging equipment for facilities across Canada should his party win next month's federal election.  Scheer said a Conservative government would buy MRI and CT machines to replace aging ones, and that the move would reduce wait times.  He cited a Conference Board of Canada report that found there are excessive wait times for those screening tests,  costing the economy billions of dollars.  Scheer said that with Canada's aging population, the demand for such exams will only increase.    The Conservatives say the investment would give provinces more spending flexibility, with the federal government footing the bill for replacing out-of-date medical imaging equipment.  Scheer also highlighted his promise to maintain and increase the Canada Health Transfer, which provides long-term health-care funding to the provinces and territories.",health
205,How DNA could be key to stopping the dangerous decline of Canada's bee colonies,"As honey bee colonies across Canada continue to die off at alarming rates, scientists at York University believe that solutions to the problem could be hiding in the insects' DNA.  In October, the university is launching a breakthrough project to help beekeepers diagnose their ailing colonies.   The goal is to fight back against a potential population decline that could devastate both the environment and Canada's agriculture industries.  ""We have a bee health crisis and we don't really know how to improve it,"" said Amro Zayed, an associate professor at York University and co-lead on the project.  Researchers estimate that Canada's honey bees pollinate around $5.5 billion worth of crops every year, ranging from fruits and vegetables to canola seeds. They also produce 90 million pounds of honey annually.    But today, around 25 per cent of all honey bee colonies die each winter, around twice the rate that experts consider sustainable.  What's more, the worsening colony deaths often mystify beekeepers, who can only explain symptoms of the decline, and not the root causes behind the deaths.  ""When colonies die, often we're kind of guessing at why they died,"" Zayed told CBC Toronto.  DNA could unlock critical 'biomarkers'  Zayed and his team, which also includes experts at the University of British Columbia, say explanations for colony deaths could be found by examining the DNA of specific bee populations.  Examining that data could yield what genomics experts call ""biomarkers,"" signs of stress encoded in the honey bee genome that are effectively switched on or off by environmental factors.    To test for those indicators, the new project will create a system that allows beekeepers to send live worker bees to diagnostics centres, which will analyze the bees for clues embedded in their DNA.  The $10 million project begins in October and is expected to be complete by 2023. A coalition of genomics and conservation organizations are funding the project.  Scientists say offering a diagnostic service to beekeepers across the country is key to the project's success, since there are a wide range of factors believed to be killing off Canada's bees.  ""The stressors that are killing a honey bee colony near corn in Ontario are going to be different from the stressors affecting a colony that's pollinating blueberries in B.C.,"" Zayed explained.    The current diagnosis system involves post-mortem analysis if dead colonies, which experts call expensive, slow and incomplete.  By diagnosing a living colony's health problems, the project creators say beekeepers will soon be able to proactively take action before their colonies die off.  ""Ideally that will prevent the large colony mortality that Canadian beekeepers experience,"" Zayed said.  Although one in four colonies die every year, Zayed said the overall number of bees is not yet in decline, since beekeepers can create new colonies by splitting the surviving ones and importing new queen bees to maintain the hive.    Wild bees also at risk  While honey bee health is in decline, wild bee populations may be facing an even more uncertain future, in part because those species are not tightly managed like their crop-pollinating cousins.  ""They're much more threatened than honey bees are,"" said Annemarie Baynton, a program manager at the city of Toronto's environment and energy office. ""Once they're lost they can't be replaced.""  Toronto is home to some 360 species of wild bees, which are increasingly threatened by habitat loss.  ""As cities, we're constantly developing, we're paving over green space, we're building over green space, so we're losing the natural habitat,"" Bayonton said.  To combat those losses, the city launched a new program this year called PollinateTO, which is set to build 37 new pollinator gardens at a cost of up to $5,000 per project.  The gardens are scheduled to be planted in the spring, and the city is aiming to build 100 new bee-friendly spaces after the next round of grants are handed out.",technology
110,Fighting climate change is not like fighting a war. It's harder,"In a personal message attached to the Green Party's election platform, Elizabeth May invokes the Second World War, Winston Churchill and the evacuation of Dunkirk to frame the challenge of combating climate change and the need for both courageous leadership and collective action.  Unfortunately, May's grasp of the historical details is a little shaky. But this isn't the first time she has used the Second World War as a metaphor. Twelve years ago, she caused a minor stir when she compared Stephen Harper's climate policies to Neville Chamberlain's appeasement of Hitler. She's also not the only public figure who has used the war effort to explain what is required now.  There is something to be said for using history to frame the issue. These are, without a doubt, consequential days. But tidy stories about Churchill's fortitude might only understate the scale and complexity of the current challenge.  Climate change is not much like modern war.  If, for example, climate change was a rogue state or an international terrorist organization that posed a grave and immediate threat to Western peace and stability, some coalition of nations likely would have agreed already to bomb it into submission. If global warming could be solved with fighter jets, somebody would have tried by now.    If climate change could be tackled as a military threat, the debate in this country would be flipped on its head. The Conservatives would be most eager to take aggressive action and there would be no grumbling about how Canada's contribution to the problem was much smaller than that of China or the United States. Joe Oliver, the former Conservative finance minister, would not be arguing that, all things considered, climate change might work out okay for Canada.  If recent history is any example, the Liberals, New Democrats and Greens would be less enthusiastic about dropping bombs. But there might still be a general agreement that Canada should make a serious contribution somehow. Public commentators would not look kindly on anyone who suggested it should be up to other countries to deal with the problem.  But climate change is not as simple as war.  For one thing, recent military interventions haven't asked anything of the average citizen. Only those members of the military charged with carrying out the mission, and their families, have faced any kind of sacrifice.  In that respect, climate change might appear to have more in common with the two world wars of the 20th century, when the home front was more directly engaged in the fight. The federal income tax, for instance, was introduced in 1917 as a means to fund the Canadian war effort. Food rationing was mandated during both world wars.    Perhaps Canadians were more deferential to authority and less cynical in those days. But the heaviest request for sacrifice — conscription for overseas military service — still put an enormous strain on national unity. The Borden government's introduction of conscription in 1917 angered farmers in the West, led to riots in Quebec and precipitated ""the worst election campaign in Canadian history.""  Mackenzie King's government subsequently tried to fight the Second World War with a voluntary force for three years before asking Canadians to approve conscription in a national plebiscite in 1942. The result once again split the country along linguistic lines: eight provinces were overwhelmingly in favour, Quebec was overwhelmingly opposed.  King — who famously said, ""conscription if necessary, but not necessarily conscription""  — stalled for another two years before following through, effectively limiting the number of conscripted men who were sent into battle before the war's end in 1945. War, in that case, required compromise.  Cinematic moments of leadership make for fun movies, but the task of holding a country together and leading it through moments of great consequence is always more complicated than we're sometimes led to believe.  The enemy is ... us?  For all their complications, real military campaigns still, at least, benefit from the presence of tangible and foreign enemies. Climate change, on the other hand, is about the society we have constructed. It's one thing to rally your fellow citizens to fight Adolf Hitler and the Nazis (particularly when, as in Churchill's case, your own country's liberty is at stake). It's something else entirely to deal with the way we ourselves live, what we do and how we do it.  Putting a price on carbon is not nearly a political event on the same level as conscription (which, by the way, did not come with the offer of a full refund). But like conscription, climate policy already has produced significant regional splits in public opinion, with opposition most heavily concentrated in Alberta and Saskatchewan, two provinces that rely on oil and gas development.  In their party platform, the Greens propose completely phasing out the production of bitumen within 15 years and transitioning energy workers to new jobs. To do that without tearing the country apart would be a remarkable achievement (the Greens are currently polling at 5 per cent in Alberta).    If climate change is like war, it can't be simply reduced to a bidding contest over who would set the most ambitious targets. It requires leadership. But it also requires bringing a country and its citizens along. The details of policy — like the details of history — matter.  To underline the threat, challenge the complacent and motivate the hopeful, war is a tempting metaphor. The sacrifices and efforts of previous generations can reinforce a sense of responsibility toward the present and the future. Historic leadership can provide enduring inspiration.  But if fighting climate change has anything in common with World War II, it's the fact that it will be hard — and more complex than we might choose to imagine. Winning a war is seldom easy.",technology
